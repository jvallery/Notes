## Key Points to Address

Acknowledge Adem Sefa's introduction, confirm receipt of Edwin Trogler's resume (or request it if not yet received), and propose specific times for a short call next week. Clarify what FP&A roles Edwin is targeting (Director vs other levels), location constraints (Colorado, remote/hybrid), and whether he is open to other finance roles if FP&A Director is not currently open.

Thank you for your email. Here's my response:

- Does Jason Vallery have time next week (relative to 2025-11-21) for a quick call with Edwin Trogler about VAST Data and FP&A opportunities in Colorado?: [TODO: Add answer]

I'll follow up on:

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Jason
