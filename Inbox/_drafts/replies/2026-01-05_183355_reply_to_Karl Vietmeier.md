## Draft Response

Hi Karl,

Thank you for your email. Here's my response:

- Respond to Karl Vietmeier with a clear ownership stance for Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Microsoft Azure Local opportunities, including how cloud product management will coordinate with on-prem teams when hardware is involved, and define accountability, visibility, and decision rights.

To answer your questions:
- How aggressively should VAST Data cloud product management assert ownership of Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Microsoft Azure Local opportunities when hardware involvement causes on-prem teams to take ownership?: [TODO: Add answer]
- How much control does Jason Vallery want cloud product management to maintain over GDC and Azure Local opportunities to ensure execution alignment with hyperscaler initiatives and cloud consumption?: [TODO: Add answer]

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Jason

## Original Summary

Karl Vietmeier reports growing interest in whether VAST supports Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Microsoft Azure Local, and notes that ownership often shifts to on-prem teams once hardware is involved. He recommends cloud product management own these opportunities to avoid accountability confusion and to align execution with hyperscaler-led acquisition and cloud consumption, and asks Jason Vallery how aggressively to assert ownership.
