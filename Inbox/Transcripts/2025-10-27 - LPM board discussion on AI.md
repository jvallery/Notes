## 0) Who you’re talking to (local grounding at a glance)

- **Longmont Public Media** is a community media makerspace and public access TV hub (≈5,000 sq ft) with podcast, livestream, audio production and media studios at **457 4th Ave., Longmont**. The site regularly distributes civic content (e.g., City Council sessions). Mission: “educates, produces, and distributes civic and artistic media in Longmont.” ([Longmont Public Media](https://longmontpublicmedia.org/ "Longmont Public Media – Longmont's Public Access TV"))
    
- **NextLight**, the **city-run, community‑owned fiber** network, offers up to **10‑Gig** symmetrical service and an **income‑qualified Internet Assistance Program**—key infrastructure for AI-era participation and digital equity in Longmont. ([NextLight](https://mynextlight.com/broadband-facts/ "Broadband Facts - NextLight"))
    
- **Colorado AI Act (SB24‑205)**: first comprehensive state AI law (amended in Aug 2025). **Effective date now June 30, 2026** (SB25B‑004) with duties on developers/deployers of “high‑risk AI” (impact assessments, notices, appeal rights, disclosures). This will touch municipal workflows and vendors the city uses. ([Colorado General Assembly](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb25b-004?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Increase Transparency for Algorithmic Systems"))
    
- **Municipal AI lessons**: Denver’s “Sunny” chatbot shows what a controlled, task‑specific assistant looks like, while NYC’s MyCity LLM bot became a cautionary tale (incorrect/illegal guidance). ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2024/04/25/denver-launches-ai-powered-chatbot-sunny?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Denver launches government info AI-powered chatbot"))
    
- **Newsroom AI practices**: Poynter’s guidance and AP’s evolving policies show credible, incremental adoption paths (human-in-the-loop, provenance, disclosure). ([Poynter](https://www.poynter.org/ai-ethics-journalism/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Artificial Intelligence, Ethics and Journalism"))

## 1) 60‑minute agenda (you can stretch to 75)

**00–05 | Cold open (hook)**

- “What happens when a small city with **city-owned fiber** and a **community media makerspace** gets frontier AI video tools?” Brief reel (pre-generated if possible). Tie to LPM’s mission. ([Longmont Public Media](https://longmontpublicmedia.org/ "Longmont Public Media – Longmont's Public Access TV"))
    

**05–15 | The near future of AI video + why it matters locally**

- Sora 2’s step-up in **controllability** and **storyboard-based directing**; 15–25s clips on web, storyboard beta first for **ChatGPT Pro** users. ([OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12593142-sora-release-notes "Sora - Release Notes | OpenAI Help Center"))
    
- What this unlocks for **civic storytelling, training, multilingual clips**, and rapid prototyping of campaigns.
    

**15–30 | Demo: Sora 2 Pro Storyboard (live or “live-ish”)**

- Run 1–2 storyboard builds (see Section 5).
    
- Emphasize **no real people’s likenesses without written consent**; stick to actors/fictional characters or generic people. ([OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9957612-generating-videos-on-sora "Generating videos on Sora | OpenAI Help Center"))
    

**30–40 | Opportunity map for LPM + City of Longmont (12–24 months)**

- Rapid content production (civic explainers, board promos), translations, accessibility, youth education, archive revitalization.
    
- Pair with **Content Credentials (C2PA)** in your pipeline to build audience trust—plus the hard truth about current platform support. ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Understanding the source of what we see and hear online"))
    

**40–50 | Risks, labor, and law**

- Deepfakes/misinformation & provenance; bias; copyright; local compliance under **Colorado’s AI Act**; newsroom ethics models; and relevant union protections. ([Colorado General Assembly](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb25b-004?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Increase Transparency for Algorithmic Systems"))
    

**50–60 | Discussion & decisions**

- What are our first 2–3 pilots? What policies do we adopt now? (See Sections 3–4 & 6.)
    

---

## 2) Talk track: “Superintelligence is coming—how do we steer it locally?”

**Frame the vision**

- “We are living through a rapid capability climb—from the ‘Sora 1’ moment of plausibility to **Sora 2’s** more controllable multi‑shot world simulation—and tooling that lets small teams direct, iterate, and publish in minutes.” ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/sora-2/ "Sora 2 is here | OpenAI"))
    
- On **timelines**: forecasts vary wildly (Metaculus community timelines, expert reviews), and even optimists like Sam Altman are publicly sketching a “gentle singularity” path. The **when** is uncertain; the **gradient** (capabilities rising annually) is not. ([Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/17124/conditional-date-of-artificial-general-intelligence/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Date of Artificial General Intelligence"))
    

**Local thesis**

- Longmont has **structural advantages** (NextLight bandwidth, LPM’s makerspace, civic habit of public meetings on-air). That positions LPM and the City to lead **responsible AI media** practices in a mid‑size municipality. ([NextLight](https://mynextlight.com/broadband-facts/ "Broadband Facts - NextLight"))
    

**Why the transition will be bumpy**

- **Misinformation risk**: C2PA credentials are promising but **often stripped by platforms**; user-facing labels are inconsistent. We must add our own visible disclosures and host originals where credentials persist. ([The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/22/ai-deepfake-sora-platforms-c2pa/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "We uploaded a fake video to 8 social apps. Only one told users it wasn't real."))
    
- **Labor & creative rights**: Industry contracts (WGA, SAG‑AFTRA) now encode consent, disclosure, and compensation for AI uses—norms the community sector should mirror. ([wga.org](https://www.wga.org/contracts/contracts/mba/summary-of-the-2023-wga-mba?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Summary of the 2023 WGA MBA"))
    
- **Regulation**: Colorado’s AI Act is delayed to **June 30, 2026**, but compliance planning should start now (vendor due diligence, notices, appeals for “consequential decisions”). ([Colorado General Assembly](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb25b-004?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Increase Transparency for Algorithmic Systems"))
    

**End-state vision**

- A **post-scarcity creative ecosystem** locally: universal access to production tools (via LPM), **affordable gigabit**(via NextLight), automated translation/captioning, and provenance by default—so trust scales with creation. ([NextLight](https://mynextlight.com/broadband-facts/ "Broadband Facts - NextLight"))
    

---

## 3) Opportunity map (for LPM & City)

1. **Civic explainer micro‑videos (15–25s) at scale**
    
    - Examples: “How to testify at City Council,” “What’s NextLight’s Internet Assistance Program?” Each with **captions + Spanish** and embedded provenance. ([NextLight](https://mynextlight.com/internet-assistance-program "Internet Assistance Program - NextLight"))
        
2. **Meeting highlight packages** (automated first pass → human edit)
    
    - Summaries of City Council/boards with lower-thirds, chaptering, and disclaimers. LPM already distributes civic meetings—this is a natural upgrade. ([Longmont Public Media](https://longmontpublicmedia.org/ "Longmont Public Media – Longmont's Public Access TV"))
        
3. **Community AI literacy series** hosted at LPM (youth to seniors)
    
    - Use Poynter/AP ethics as templates; teach when to trust AI video and how to read **Content Credentials**. ([Poynter](https://www.poynter.org/ai-ethics-journalism/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Artificial Intelligence, Ethics and Journalism"))
        
4. **Local newsroom co‑pilot**
    
    - Internal tools for script drafting, translation, metadata, thumbnail selection; adhere to AP-style guardrails (human in the loop). ([The Associated Press](https://www.ap.org/the-definitive-source/behind-the-news/updates-to-generative-ai-standards/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Updates to generative AI standards | The Associated Press"))
        
5. **Provenance-first distribution**
    
    - Bake **C2PA Content Credentials** into all originals on your owned channels; add clear on‑screen disclosure for downstream platforms that strip metadata. ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Understanding the source of what we see and hear online"))
        

---

## 4) Risks & mitigations (practical checklist)

- **Misinformation/Deepfakes**
    
    - _Mitigate_: provenance by default (C2PA), explicit on-screen labels, link to originals on LPM site; do not depict real local officials without consent. ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Understanding the source of what we see and hear online"))
        
- **Bias & representation** (known issues in generative video models)
    
    - _Mitigate_: inclusive casting prompts, review checklists, community advisory input. ([WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-sora-video-generator-bias?utm_source=chatgpt.com "OpenAI's Sora Is Plagued by Sexist, Racist, and Ableist Biases"))
        
- **Copyright & likeness**
    
    - _Mitigate_: Sora TOS: no uploads of people without **written consent**; maintain talent releases and music licenses. ([OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9957612-generating-videos-on-sora "Generating videos on Sora | OpenAI Help Center"))
        
- **Labor impacts**
    
    - _Mitigate_: align with emerging labor norms (WGA, SAG‑AFTRA) around consent, disclosure, and compensation for digital replicas/AI‑assisted work. ([wga.org](https://www.wga.org/contracts/contracts/mba/summary-of-the-2023-wga-mba?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Summary of the 2023 WGA MBA"))
        
- **Legal compliance (Colorado AI Act)**
    
    - _Mitigate_: map “high‑risk” uses (employment, housing, etc.), require vendor impact assessments and public notices ahead of **June 30, 2026**. ([Colorado General Assembly](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb25b-004?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Increase Transparency for Algorithmic Systems"))

## 5) **Live demo:** Sora 2 Pro Storyboard mode (Longmont‑specific)

> **Important**: For the live room prompts below, **do not** use real people’s likenesses or copyrighted characters; keep scenes generic/local. Sora’s help center prohibits uploading images/videos of other individuals without express written consent. ([OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9957612-generating-videos-on-sora "Generating videos on Sora | OpenAI Help Center"))  
> **Capabilities** to highlight: storyboard cards with timestamps, pacing via gaps, multi‑shot continuity, 15–25s lengths on web (25s for Pro). ([OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12593142-sora-release-notes "Sora - Release Notes | OpenAI Help Center"))

### A) “Past → Present → Future of Longmont media” (25s, 16:9)

**Storyboard cards (you’ll paste each card’s text into Sora’s storyboard at the timecode):**

- **0.0s — 4.0s (Establishing)**: “Wide aerial of **Downtown Longmont** at golden hour; **Longs Peak** in the distance; subtle lower‑third: _‘Longmont, Colorado’_. Smooth dolly forward.” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Longmont_Historic_District?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Downtown Longmont Historic District"))
    
- **4.0s — 9.0s (Present)**: “Interior, **LPM**: friendly, modern makerspace with podcast mics, LED panels; volunteers prepping a civic show. Handheld, natural light.” ([Longmont Public Media](https://longmontpublicmedia.org/ "Longmont Public Media – Longmont's Public Access TV"))
    
- **9.0s — 15.0s (Connectivity)**: “Close-ups of fiber equipment morphing into **NextLight** fiber map animation; text overlay: _‘Community‑owned fiber’_.” ([NextLight](https://mynextlight.com/ "NextLight – Longmont's Fiber-Fast Internet"))
    
- **15.0s — 20.0s (Civic)**: “Studio control room view of a **City Council** feed; operator tagging chapters: _‘Public comment’, ‘Vote’_; quick rack focus to waveform.” ([Longmont Public Media](https://longmontpublicmedia.org/ "Longmont Public Media – Longmont's Public Access TV"))
    
- **20.0s — 25.0s (Future)**: “Imagined 2028 newsroom: producer arranges **storyboard cards** on a holographic timeline; on-screen watermark: _‘Content Credentials embedded’_.” ([OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12593142-sora-release-notes "Sora - Release Notes | OpenAI Help Center"))
    

**Callouts while you build:** show dragging cards to adjust pacing, and how leaving small gaps smooths transitions. ([OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9957612-generating-videos-on-sora "Generating videos on Sora | OpenAI Help Center"))

---

### B) “Explainer: NextLight Internet Assistance” (15s, square for socials)

- **0.0–4.0s**: “Animated map pin to _Longmont_; concise text: _‘Need affordable internet?’_”
    
- **4.0–10.0s**: “Friendly, generic family using home Wi‑Fi; overlay bullets: _100 Mbps $14.95 / 1 Gig $44.95 (qualifying households)_.” ([NextLight](https://mynextlight.com/internet-assistance-program "Internet Assistance Program - NextLight"))
    
- **10.0–15.0s**: “CTA card: _‘Learn more at NextLight Internet Assistance’_ + provenance badge.” ([NextLight](https://mynextlight.com/internet-assistance-program "Internet Assistance Program - NextLight"))
    

---

### C) “Civic safety: how to spot AI video” (20s, 9:16 vertical)

- **0.0–5.0s**: “Split-screen: ‘Real footage’ vs ‘AI‑generated’ label; magnifying glass icon on **Content Credentials**badge.” ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Understanding the source of what we see and hear online"))
    
- **5.0–12.0s**: “Example artifacts (hands/physics) then note that platform uploads may **strip credentials**; always click through to trusted source.” ([The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/22/ai-deepfake-sora-platforms-c2pa/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "We uploaded a fake video to 8 social apps. Only one told users it wasn't real."))
    
- **12.0–20.0s**: “Overlay checklist: ‘Look for provenance → Check source link → Be wary of re‑uploads’.”
    

---

### D) “Landmark vibe piece” (10–15s, 16:9)

- **0.0–6.0s**: “Sunrise at **McIntosh Lake** with geese; **Longs Peak** visible; light ripples.” ([Visit Longmont](https://www.visitlongmont.org/listing/mcintosh-lake/14264/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "McIntosh Lake"))
    
- **6.0–12.0s**: “Cut to **Roosevelt Park** rose garden close-ups; gentle camera slide.” ([Downtown Longmont](https://www.downtownlongmont.com/go/roosevelt-park?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Roosevelt Park | Downtown Longmont, CO"))
    
- **12.0–15.0s** (optional): “Lower‑third: ‘Shot on Sora 2 storyboard • demo footage • not real locations’.”
    

> **Tip**: If rendering times feel tight in the room, pre‑generate once and then use **Re‑cut** to open in Storyboard and make quick changes live. ([OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9957612-generating-videos-on-sora "Generating videos on Sora | OpenAI Help Center"))

## 6) Questions to ask the board (designed to drive decisions)

**Strategy & mission**

1. Which LPM missions—**civic information**, **arts**, **education**—benefit most from AI‑assisted video this year? ([Longmont Public Media](https://longmontpublicmedia.org/about/mission-vision-values/ "Mission, Vision, Values – Longmont Public Media"))
    
2. What _audience outcomes_ matter most (reach, comprehension, trust, multilingual access)?
    

**Governance & risk**  
3) Are we comfortable adopting a **provenance-by-default** policy (C2PA) even if social platforms strip labels? ([The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/22/ai-deepfake-sora-platforms-c2pa/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "We uploaded a fake video to 8 social apps. Only one told users it wasn't real."))  
4) Where will we draw red lines (e.g., _no likeness_ of real locals without consent; mandatory captions)? ([OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9957612-generating-videos-on-sora "Generating videos on Sora | OpenAI Help Center"))  
5) What’s our stance on **bias audits** for AI‑generated imagery of people? (Who reviews?)

**Labor & training**  
6) How do we ensure **consent, disclosure, and fair comp** when synthetic voices/replicas are involved—mirroring WGA/SAG‑AFTRA norms? ([wga.org](https://www.wga.org/contracts/contracts/mba/summary-of-the-2023-wga-mba?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Summary of the 2023 WGA MBA"))  
7) What training do staff/volunteers want first (storyboarding, safety, provenance tools)?

**Legal & municipal**  
8) For the City’s AI pilots, which uses could be “**high‑risk**” under Colorado law (hiring screens, housing notices, eligibility calculators)? What vendor documentation will we require before **June 30, 2026**? ([Colorado General Assembly](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb25b-004?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Increase Transparency for Algorithmic Systems"))  
9) What’s the city’s appetite for a **narrow chatbot** (like Denver’s) vs a general LLM interface (like NYC’s problematic one)? ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2024/04/25/denver-launches-ai-powered-chatbot-sunny?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Denver launches government info AI-powered chatbot"))

**Pilots & metrics**  
10) Which **two pilots** do we greenlight today, with concrete success metrics (views/retention, caption uptake, complaints rate, provenance click‑throughs)?

---

## 7) Draft policy starter kit for LPM (you can adopt/modify)

- **Provenance**: Publish originals with **C2PA Content Credentials**; add on‑screen disclosures on all platforms; keep a public “About our AI use” page explaining your signals. ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Understanding the source of what we see and hear online"))
    
- **Consent**: No real-person likenesses without **written consent**; keep releases on file; never imply endorsements. ([OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9957612-generating-videos-on-sora "Generating videos on Sora | OpenAI Help Center"))
    
- **Disclosure**: Any AI‑assisted content gets a visible tag: “AI‑assisted video created with Sora 2; editorial oversight by LPM.” (Modelled on Poynter/AP guidance.) ([Poynter](https://www.poynter.org/ai-ethics-journalism/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Artificial Intelligence, Ethics and Journalism"))
    
- **Editorial control**: Human editor signs off on facts and framing; keep a pre‑publish checklist (accuracy, representation, accessibility). ([The Associated Press](https://www.ap.org/the-definitive-source/behind-the-news/updates-to-generative-ai-standards/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Updates to generative AI standards | The Associated Press"))
    
- **Labor norms**: If synthetic voices/replicas ever become relevant, follow union‑style provisions on consent, scope, and compensation. ([SAG-AFTRA](https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/sa_documents/TV-Theatrical_23_Summary_Agreement_Final.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "TV/ THEATRICAL CONTRACTS 2023"))
    
- **Records**: Maintain prompt history, versions, and credentials logs for public‑facing civic content (auditability, corrections).
    

---

## 8) Three pilot ideas you can approve today

1. **Civic Micro‑Explainers** (6‑part series, 15–25s each)
    
    - Topics: “How to comment at City Council,” “Utility assistance,” “Where to watch”
        
    - _Stack_: Sora 2 storyboard + captions + C2PA + Spanish variants.
        
    - _KPI_: 50% avg completion rate; 25% increase in traffic to source pages. ([Longmont Public Media](https://longmontpublicmedia.org/ "Longmont Public Media – Longmont's Public Access TV"))
        
2. **Meeting Highlights with Provenance**
    
    - Auto‑summaries → human vet → publish to LPM with Content Credentials; cross‑post to social with visible on‑screen disclosure since many platforms strip metadata.
        
    - _KPI_: Reduction in viewer drop‑off before agenda items; provenance click‑throughs. ([The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/22/ai-deepfake-sora-platforms-c2pa/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "We uploaded a fake video to 8 social apps. Only one told users it wasn't real."))
        
3. **Digital Equity Series with NextLight**
    
    - 3 short explainers on the **Internet Assistance Program** & how to apply; distribute through city and LPM channels.
        
    - _KPI_: Increase inquiries/applications; survey recall. ([NextLight](https://mynextlight.com/internet-assistance-program "Internet Assistance Program - NextLight"))
        

---

## 9) Extra: Prompt templates you can hand to the room

> Paste into the **Storyboard composer** as individual cards; adjust times and gaps for pacing. (Use short, clear beats; Sora follows shorter clips most reliably.) ([OpenAI Cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/sora/sora2_prompting_guide "Sora 2 Prompting Guide"))

**Template: Scene shot**

- _“[timecode] [FRAMING + CAMERA MOVE], [LOCATION], [ACTION in 1 clause], [LIGHTING], [STYLE]. Add caption: ‘[text]’. Keep subject generic.”_
    

**Template: People safety**

- _“Use generic adults/teens (no specific likeness), diverse representation across age/ethnicity, respectful wardrobe; natural gestures.”_ ([WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-sora-video-generator-bias?utm_source=chatgpt.com "OpenAI's Sora Is Plagued by Sexist, Racist, and Ableist Biases"))
    

**Template: Provenance lower-third**

- _“Lower‑third: ‘AI‑assisted demo • Content Credentials embedded • See source link for details’.”_ ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Understanding the source of what we see and hear online"))
    

---

## 10) Live‑demo checklist (operational)

- **Pre-bake** one version of each demo (use **Re‑cut** in the room to tweak pacing/styles). ([OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9957612-generating-videos-on-sora "Generating videos on Sora | OpenAI Help Center"))
    
- Keep **2–3 alternate prompts** ready (if physics or faces go weird).
    
- Avoid **real local officials**; don’t upload images/videos of people without consent. ([OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9957612-generating-videos-on-sora "Generating videos on Sora | OpenAI Help Center"))
    
- End with a **provenance view**: show how you’ll host originals with credentials on an LPM page and what viewers should look for on re‑uploads. ([The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/22/ai-deepfake-sora-platforms-c2pa/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "We uploaded a fake video to 8 social apps. Only one told users it wasn't real."))

## 11) One‑slide “what’s changing this year” (for your close)

- **Tools**: Sora 2 storyboard gives small teams director‑style control over 15–25s multi‑shot pieces. ([OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12593142-sora-release-notes "Sora - Release Notes | OpenAI Help Center"))
    
- **Infrastructure**: Longmont’s community‑owned fiber → creative capacity + equity. ([NextLight](https://mynextlight.com/broadband-facts/ "Broadband Facts - NextLight"))
    
- **Governance**: Colorado’s AI Act is coming (**June 30, 2026**); city + LPM should set the standard now. ([Colorado General Assembly](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb25b-004?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Increase Transparency for Algorithmic Systems"))
    
- **Trust**: Provenance (C2PA) + disclosure beats whack‑a‑mole detection; educate your audience. ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Understanding the source of what we see and hear online"))
    
- **Labor**: Adopt consent & credit norms consistent with WGA/SAG‑AFTRA when relevant. ([wga.org](https://www.wga.org/contracts/contracts/mba/summary-of-the-2023-wga-mba?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Summary of the 2023 WGA MBA"))
