Thank you.
*00:16*

**Lior Genzel**: Hey, Ironman, what's up?
*00:48*

**Jason Vallery**: You're...Iron Man.
*00:50*

**Jason Vallery**: How much about you? How are you doing?
*00:54*

**Lior Genzel**: Ironman.
*00:54*

**Lior Genzel**: I'm doing good.
*00:57*

**Jason Vallery**: Are you back in Tel Aviv now? Yeah. Right.
*00:59*

**Lior Genzel**: Yeah, back in Tel Aviv. As you saw, Alon met with them. I'm jumping straight to Microsoft. So I sent a summary email at the beginning of the week. So then that will just be a summary. I didn't go into all the details of everything we did or didn't do because everything is shared in five different channels during the week. I've kind of tried to summarize it for my level.
*01:03*

**Lior Genzel**: But now between you and I, I think kind of what I want to promote is, let's start from the important ones. So I've been exchanging messages with our friend Kushal. Kushal is saying that most people are already out of the office. And I told him, we're going to be out to arrange a call with the loan. And I told him, look, you never met with the loan. Let's set a call with the loan. Invite people you think that would appreciate the first introduction to Vast.
*01:28*

**Jason Vallery**: Yeah.
*01:40*

**Lior Genzel**: It's only you. And let's have a call with Alon. So that's that. I've also asked him, even though he didn't reply to me, he didn't see my last message. I also want to have a quick call with him. Because, you know, I want to ask him some logistical process questions that are not related to technology. That's his front. And you are on the email with Alon VPNs feedback. Correct? You're on that email. Yeah. Yeah.
*01:58*

**Jason Vallery**: Yeah, like a few thoughts.
*02:20*

**Jason Vallery**: So first on the email from alone, I mean, it seems like good news.
*02:22*

**Jason Vallery**: The comment around Kushal or getting a different manager and the same manager in Vipin is, I think there's a little confusion about organizational structure, but I certainly am equally confused because clearly they've been hiring and there's a lot of changes. But historically, Kushal and Vipin were different parts of MAI. Where Vipin was part of the team responsible for operating infrastructure and Kushal was part of like the business,
*02:27*

**Jason Vallery**: this team that was just sort of building out the like broader vision of the research org and how that related to their future looking requirements. They had very different managers. So I don't know what this new guy is. Certainly when I saw the org chart that Jack shared with me, because I sent you the screenshot, like that had this young Chow guy as Kushal's manager, which would have been a change since I was there. And that guy was the one that came from Verkata, which is like,
*02:57*

**Lior Genzel**: Yeah.
*03:15*

**Jason Vallery**: a video surveillance company, so totally weird. And then this guy that alone identified, I looked him up on LinkedIn, and he also joined, but like, I don't know, a month and a half ago. He came from, now I'm forgetting, it was like, he was at Meta, and then he had a stop somewhere else, and then at MAI, I don't remember the stop somewhere else, but he spent a lot of time at Meta. So I don't know, effectively what we need to get is the stakeholder map,
*03:27*

**Jason Vallery**: of who to influence. If you can leverage LIA. So it would be the entire chart, right? It would be, yeah, Vipin flows up to see how Kushal.
*03:56*

**Lior Genzel**: So Leah got me all the names. And I hope... Yay! That's what I asked. I said, these are the five people we interact with right now. And I want to know their flow chart all the way up. Right? Who reports to whom? Who does what? And I also said that if anybody in Israel has any good connections to MAI that really understands what's going on there, I would like to talk to that person. So check with the Israeli
*04:01*

**Lior Genzel**: So yes, it's in my email. We need to map MAI. We need to understand because we have Kushal, we have Vipin, and we have them being upset about Azure. It's not good enough. Simple. It's not good enough.
*04:32*

**Jason Vallery**: Well, so what's unclear to me is, like, when you get up further into the hierarchy, no doubt Mustafa's under pressure from Scott and Satya to say,
*04:44*

**Jason Vallery**: Well, your goal as MAI, like, let me actually back up a little bit. First principle of Microsoft. This is an old school principle that predates me, goes back to the Bill Gates era. And the statement of Microsoft as a thesis has always been, we're a platform company, and we eat our own dog food. And so the theory behind this statement across all of Microsoft, regardless of the product, has been that Microsoft is its own biggest customer,
*04:56*

**Jason Vallery**: And therefore, if you force Microsoft to build on top of Microsoft, Microsoft gets better. And so this is actually one of the reasons like when you the Apollo project is so outside the norm, right? Like Microsoft has always been, we build our own intellectual property, and we build it with inside the house so that the house benefits as a whole. And Apollo comes in and says, we're just going to take everything open source and reuse it is not Microsoft's MO ever. And so no doubt, Satya has come
*05:26*

**Jason Vallery**: from that birthright of we eat our own dog food and has been coaching Mustafa on your goal is to make Azure successful. Right. So if Mustafa's requirements can't be met on Azure, then the question is, how do we build those things together? And in that world, Manish keeps getting a shock. Right. Because in that world, Sacha's outcome is we prefer to see Azure storage successful versus vast. And that's probably true across all of the different things Mustafa's team is using.
*05:56*

**Jason Vallery**: So at that level, it's going to be very different than Kushal and Vipin who are like, fucking Azure Storage sucks. Give me something that works, right? So it's where do we meet in the middle on that thesis and how much of an advocate for Kushal and Vipin is Mustafa.
*06:25*

**Lior Genzel**: Thank you.
*06:25*

**Lior Genzel**: Okay, so I am with you. A comment on Project Apollo. It's still a Microsoft internal project, meaning even Microsoft decides to flow with Kubernetes, right, and flow with open source technologies. Project Apollo is how does Microsoft uses all the good things that everybody has created to create a new project?
*06:40*

**Lior Genzel**: a Microsoft solution.
*06:58*

**Lior Genzel**: It's still within Microsoft.
*07:00*

**Lior Genzel**: It's not going to a third party and bind.
*07:01*

**Lior Genzel**: Like if we win Project Apollo,
*07:03*

**Lior Genzel**: then it's completely,
*07:06*

**Lior Genzel**: you know,
*07:08*

**Lior Genzel**: it's against,
*07:08*

**Lior Genzel**: but right now,
*07:09*

**Lior Genzel**: a kind of Project Apollo was still created internally to challenge Microsoft internally.
*07:10*

**Lior Genzel**: So I think it's still within the same logic you described before.
*07:15*

**Lior Genzel**: Now,
*07:18*

**Jason Vallery**: I mean, you like, just comment on that. When we had that meeting with Anson, when we were at Super-Sputing,
*07:19*

**Lior Genzel**: I,
*07:20*

**Lior Genzel**: yeah.
*07:20*

**Lior Genzel**: Yeah.
*07:23*

**Jason Vallery**: He told us the thesis behind that team was go fast, use open source, hire open source, find people that have built these technologies out in public, contribute back to those projects. That's a very different ethos. That just doesn't exist in any of the teams I've worked in at Microsoft. So that is a different thing, potentially.
*07:25*

**Lior Genzel**: Okay.
*07:37*

**Lior Genzel**: Yeah, but it's a go-fetch exercise. How many people are there? It's like go disrupt. If it's extremely successful, then Microsoft created a team internally, not externally, that can disrupt Microsoft. And if it failed, then they've learned something from the process. It's different than Project Apollo making a decision in a month that everything they're building is based on vast technology because that's the way to go. Then Project Apollo is really completely... But I agree. I understand what you're saying. Even Project Apollo itself, even that approach,
*07:45*

**Jason Vallery**: Thank you.
*08:09*

**Lior Genzel**: is disruptive.
*08:15*

**Lior Genzel**: Now, I need to, I am supposed to get an answer, hopefully, this week.
*08:17*

**Lior Genzel**: If Renan will have a meeting mid-January in Davos with Satya.
*08:21*

**Jason Vallery**: Okay.
*08:26*

**Lior Genzel**: So two meetings were requested.
*08:28*

**Lior Genzel**: And this is with Leah.
*08:30*

**Lior Genzel**: There is no approval yet.
*08:32*

**Lior Genzel**: Satya and Jadson.
*08:33*

**Lior Genzel**: Now, Jadson, I told Leah, Jadson for me is not the biggest meeting because Jadson wants to see us on the marketplace.
*08:35*

**Lior Genzel**: And this is the last thing we do.
*08:42*

**Lior Genzel**: So that can only backfire. But again, the reason why I didn't ask you to cancel, because I said if one of them accepts the meeting, then there is a trigger for meeting Scott. Because Scott would want to meet. Scott is not going to that event. And I've checked to see if Mustafa goes. I didn't get an answer yet. But if Rennan has a meeting with one of those guys, then Leah and your CEO boss can say, we have a CEO portfolio that's going to meet with your boss.
*08:43*

**Lior Genzel**: and they're talking on engineering collaborations, you should meet him. And then we can have a meeting between Renan and Scott and accelerate the conversation on that level. And again, Renan is an uncontrollable person in a meeting. So if we're not positioned prior to that meeting with Scott with the right supporting people or the right supporting story, then Renan is not going to make miracle here. He's not going to convince Scott that everything that Satya created or Manish created is junk and they shouldn't get an opportunity. But there will be a meeting with Scott.
*09:13*

**Lior Genzel**: Scott, that's what I'm saying. There will be a meeting with Scott between now and mid-January if Satya approves the meeting and then a meeting with Satya. Mustafa, yeah, okay. I remember.
*09:43*

**Jason Vallery**: So, let me come out.
*09:49*

**Jason Vallery**: Sorry, I guess you were going to stop it. That's where I was going to head. So just rewinding the clock to pre-Rennen meeting with Kuchal. So in the two weeks leading up to that, Renan told me, like, you must get me into that data center tour. After the needy meeting, he was like, you must get me here. So I was pulling all of my favors and trying to make things happen. I actually pissed off Sagar in the process. It was a whole thing.
*09:53*

**Jason Vallery**: And when I was having a conversation with Kushal around this, I asked Kushal, is Mustafa going to the data center tour? And what Kushal told me was, no, Kushal, Mustafa's chief of staff, Majid, would be there, and Kushal and Kushal's team. And I asked, we'd like to get Lenin with Mustafa. At that moment, I asked him. And he came back with, well, if that's the objective, we can do that in January.
*10:23*

**Lior Genzel**: Yeah.
*10:42*

**Jason Vallery**: and get an opportunity with Renan to meet Mustafa. So he kind of virtually offered to try and make a connection between Renan and Mustafa. Now he may not hold, may not stay accountable to that, but I do feel like there's an opening to just say Renan wants to continue the dialogue that he started with you in New Jersey. And then surprisingly in that meeting that Renan had, Majid didn't show up. It was just Kushal and a couple of people that report to Kushal, Boomi and I think the other guys named Rohit or something.
*10:53*

**Jason Vallery**: So, could we talk with the most...
*11:22*

**Lior Genzel**: Okay, so commenting on that. First is, I learned in my business career is that shooting fast usually shoots back. So even if you offer something that is the greatest advice and there is no incentive in making the move that day, it's not postponing stuff or being late.
*11:22*

**Lior Genzel**: Let's think about it. Let's take a day. Let's take the weekend. When you suggested it, I was kind of saying Kushal is the only kind of supporter we have. VPN was pre-connected to VPN or VPN making moves. Now we see that VPN is afraid of his own shadow. So Kushal is still the only guy that has some balls. And if we upset him, then we might lose something. But, you know, now with the added color of what you just shared and the overall fact that there are
*11:43*

**Lior Genzel**: So I will offer it to Kushal and I will tell him that's coming from Rennan. I would love to meet, meet and greet, get to know him, so on and so forth.
*12:17*

**Jason Vallery**: And you might even just be like, hey, Renan's going to be at Davos. Scott's going to be there. I think Scott's going to be there. Judson's going to be there. Sasha's going to be there. Will Mustafa be there? If yes, can we arrange a meeting? If no, can we get a virtual meeting with Renan or Renan's happy to travel and meet Mustafa wherever?
*12:27*

**Lior Genzel**: Yeah, I think Scott is not going to Davos. That's at least what he told me. But yes, I'm with you. The tactical suggested what you just shared. You also shared it over, I think, WhatsApp or email last week. So I blocked it Friday saying might be the wrong move. Again, try not to break more China. And again, just in general, like how do we strategize on win-win-win and trying to
*12:48*

**Jason Vallery**: Yeah.
*12:52*

**Jason Vallery**: Yeah.
*13:01*

**Lior Genzel**: figure out the path, but a weekend has passed. You just shared the issue. I think it's a good move.
*13:13*

**Jason Vallery**: I see it going one of two ways. Assuming we use Kushal as the entry point, it goes one of two ways. One way is that Kushal sees it as a great opportunity to kind of broker the VAST MAI story and help influence Mustafa, his boss, to his objective, which is to get VAST instead of Azure Storage. So either it wins Kushal that way, or the other way is that Kushal truly is blowing smoke up our ass as a snake and has been lying to us, and he blocks the meeting with Ren.
*13:14*

**Jason Vallery**: But at least he was still in control. So the question will be, does he block a meeting with Renan or does he sponsor a meeting with Renan? And I think that's a little bit of a tell in terms of Kuchel's state of mind on the whole thing. So the other thing, and I'll just give you heads up, I sent Kuchel and I am this morning. I haven't heard back from him.
*13:44*

**Lior Genzel**: What you're saying is a win-win. There is nothing to lose here. It's either we win a meeting or we win a read on Kushal's attitude. I'm with you.
*13:56*

**Jason Vallery**: Jeff had a meeting on Friday. I don't know, maybe you heard it. I actually think it's maybe not as big as a bomb as Jeff thinks it is. And I don't know if he's reading way too much into it. But Jeff thinks it's a big deal, which is that there's a cluster that they're getting in in scale Portugal. Now, who is getting it is not clear to me. Obviously, I'm playing a game of telephone and I'm hearing what Jeff heard.
*14:14*

**Lior Genzel**: Okay, so that's the n-scale boom, right? Okay, tell me.
*14:17*

**Jason Vallery**: through Jeff, he thinks it's going to MAI. My take is it's probably co-pilot because of the scale of it, but regardless, and it's probably an inferencing cluster, not a training cluster because of its size. So in that world, what they said was the N-Scale facility in Portugal has no room for storage, and that the way they're going to manage storage is by connecting to the adjacent Azure region in Spain, and that there will be storage in Spain.
*14:44*

**Jason Vallery**: I actually can tell you that there's a lot of storage in Spain because I deployed a bunch for open AI there that they never used so there's plenty of storage in Spain so if this is an inferencing cluster and not a training cluster that's probably very fine with Microsoft there's probably not an opportunity here but but Jeff in his head thinks this is explosive in a way to go poke holes so I texted Kuchel this morning and said are you guys also getting some in scale capacity in Portugal I haven't heard that from you
*15:14*

**Lior Genzel**: Okay.
*15:38*

**Lior Genzel**: It's not a big boom. I would be surprised if you're wrong and Jeff is correct. But I actually thought that it's something else when I saw the N-scale. I thought because N-scale bought a lot of stuff from us, like $50 million deal a while back. And they also bought a lot of hardware. And I thought that Jeff is referring to the fact that they might have a lot of capacity. And with all the shortage right now in the market, maybe we should promote N-scale as an alternative or something. So it's just about,
*15:40*

**Lior Genzel**: the Portugal cluster.
*16:09*

**Jason Vallery**: It's just...
*16:09*

**Lior Genzel**: Alone,
*16:10*

**Lior Genzel**: alone on.
*16:11*

**Lior Genzel**: So you check it with Kushal.
*16:12*

**Lior Genzel**: I'm not going to,
*16:14*

**Lior Genzel**: to bring that up with him when he gets back to me.
*16:15*

**Lior Genzel**: And alone also.
*16:18*

**Lior Genzel**: Okay.
*16:20*

**Lior Genzel**: So kind of what's in my email and what's clearly good for us is that this.
*16:21*

**Lior Genzel**: Apollo POC now that is moving into core with,
*16:27*

**Lior Genzel**: and we'll see exactly,
*16:30*

**Lior Genzel**: you know,
*16:31*

**Lior Genzel**: how it moves into core with is moving into a production environment of vast.
*16:31*

**Lior Genzel**: So my target is also to see that Kushal gets all his PLC bake-off requirements from really looking at MAI environment and Corvive. So to unite Apollo and Kushal because we're not going to have a bake-off in New Jersey. There's no time for a bake-off in New Jersey. Right now in mid-December, we're going to do the holidays. Decisions will be made the latest. If we're going to be disrupting, it's going to be in January because we will need to start deploying in March.
*16:35*

**Jason Vallery**: So, there's a bunch behind this.
*17:04*

**Jason Vallery**: So I don't know, did I debrief with you on the Bifrost conversation I had with Ryan Erdman? I don't even know if we got a chance to connect because it was kind of right as I was leaving town. So there's a guy who's an engineering leader for Manish. He actually has Skip as Manish and has been in the team forever. Yeah, I mean, he's got 30 people reporting to him now focused on Project Bifrost.
*17:08*

**Lior Genzel**: So.
*17:25*

**Lior Genzel**: That's the guy, the blob guy that is now a part of the task force to try and improve Azure Blob. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We talked about it. I just didn't remember the name of the project. So the project name is Bifrost. Okay.
*17:28*

**Jason Vallery**: We also talked about Bifrost in the morning with Peter and Marino. Yeah, like in the Iron Man Thor legend of Asgard, the bridge that connects the two worlds. I don't know. I didn't name it. So Peter and Ryan are like besties. They work together forever.
*17:38*

**Jason Vallery**: with them a ton in the past in the early days of Azure Storage. So we built a close relationship as the few white guys on the team. Just got to be honest. And so anyway, Ryan and I are good, good friends. And I had coffee with him and he talked a little bit more about some of the details behind Bifrost. And as I kind of sat on that conversation a little bit, even over the weekend and just kind of noodled, what I'm coming to the conclusion on is that really that is the Hail Mary from Manish.
*18:08*

**Lior Genzel**: Yeah.
*18:13*

**Jason Vallery**: Like what's happening right now is I'm sure Mustafa came back bitching with his list of here's all of the shit so just rewind this back last July the first supercomputer for training was handed to MAI that was Azure and this was the project I worked on Kushal with in the beginning of this year so in July they got Falcon was the name of it and it's I don't know 40,000 H100s and a couple exabytes of blob storage in Phoenix and they had a terrible
*18:38*

**Lior Genzel**: Yeah.
*18:53*

**Jason Vallery**: experience operationalizing it across the entire stack. Control plane, storage, reliability, nodes and service, all of those things were just really a terrible experience. I've heard firsthand about it. Logging and monitoring, they had no observability stack, all of it was terrible. I assume, and this is what I'm thinking happened, out of that project came an escalation from Mustafa. You heard Sagar talk about Mustafa's really good about writing emails, but that's all he's good at.
*19:08*

**Lior Genzel**: Yeah.
*19:24*

**Jason Vallery**: I assume there was a big escalation from Mustafa about all of the reasons that Project Falcon was a failure. And that came back to Azure as these are the things you must address. And I imagine there are a whole bunch of things happening right now on that to do list coming back from Mustafa and the items that got segmented underneath storage went to Manish and that's what's fueling this Bifos project. And so ultimately that means that he's got a shot if he can tick that list of things off. I think I also told you,
*19:37*

**Lior Genzel**: Thank you.
*19:54*

**Jason Vallery**: I didn't tell you I told Jeff this so Pete Emming the guy who used to report to me that's based here actually I'm getting coffee with him with him on Thursday this is fantastic he and I are going to go get coffee I'll get more details then he told me firsthand that Manish had him do a demo of all of the observability logging management operation capabilities of VAST so he got access to MAI's CoreWeave VAST cluster and he
*20:07*

**Lior Genzel**: Yeah.
*20:13*

**Jason Vallery**: We did a presentation to all of Manisha's LT on how to use VAST, all of the monitoring, logging capabilities, like all of that based on the feedback from what failed in the past. My assumption is they've taken all of this. They've taken that and they've made a project plan out of it, and that is Bifrost. I don't know all of what's in scope, but it covers, according to Ryan, the entirety of the system and the stack. So there's got to be a timeline behind that, and I can tell you with certainty it's not January.
*20:37*

**Lior Genzel**: Yeah.
*20:48*

**Jason Vallery**: It's not February. It's not March. They're giving them more time than that. There's just no way they could have executed quicker. It's probably more correlated to that May timeline. And even that, there's probably a set of follow-ups behind it. So I don't actually think that they're going to be able to compare us against a Manish solution until summertime. Because that's honestly how long it's going to be.
*21:06*

**Lior Genzel**: Is there,
*21:26*

**Lior Genzel**: Is there a bifrost option of better together? Going back to VPNs feedback to alone. Meaning even if it's a bullshit approach, right? But better together of combining VAST with Azure Blob for this MAI requirement?
*21:28*

**Jason Vallery**: Well, I mean, there's a few ways to look at what better together looks like. And I think you have to layer in a whole bunch of operational complexity. Better together could be a TCO story. Better together could be a functional story. Or better together could be purely a just like, I don't know, doing it for the sake of doing it, like with no real justification, but it takes some time to do it.
*21:43*

**Jason Vallery**: somebody's ego, like doing it for politics, let's call it that. Yeah, yeah, it's politics for TCO or for functionality. Better together from a functional perspective, arguably, they've probably wrote a bunch of tooling against the blob API, and then the blob data movement capabilities are actually great. So actually one of the things Jeff asked me to start looking at on Friday is putting together a specification for us to do a blob API on top of VAST.
*22:06*

**Lior Genzel**: Okay, so BS, functional or TCO, these are the three options. Okay. Yeah.
*22:09*

**Lior Genzel**: Yeah.
*22:36*

**Jason Vallery**: So we can maybe tick that Better Together story from a functional perspective off by just doing blob over vast.
*22:36*

**Lior Genzel**: But if we do blob over vast, that doesn't put blob at the MAI New Jersey data center. It's better to get off. We're integrating with blob the right way.
*22:46*

**Lior Genzel**: But that's not making us... When they fought better together, it's the same requirement in New Jersey. Not just in general, better together. So they need an exabyte and it's a portion of us and portions of Blob and somehow it's better together.
*22:57*

**Jason Vallery**: Yeah. Yeah.
*23:06*

**Jason Vallery**: Better Together on the TCO front is really going to come down to hardware and capacity.
*23:15*

**Jason Vallery**: And so I think about this when you layer in the supply chain constraints we're in.
*23:22*

**Jason Vallery**: And I actually tell you, like, I really am thinking about sending an email to Jeff and Wolfie and Rick and everybody about this. Because, I mean, here's the interesting thing. I think you were in the chat thread that Eric started on Friday that I had with NVIDIA and those folks. Here's my worry. Knowing the hard drive industry and knowing the flash industry, they're entirely different manufacturers, right? Like, the flash manufacturers make DRAM and HBM, but the flash manufacturers
*23:27*

**Lior Genzel**: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*23:43*

**Jason Vallery**: don't make hard drives and the hard drive manufacturers really don't make flash and there's a small amount of it but uh like what the industry will do is probably take a few steps back on its movement towards flash right because the hard drive manufacturers are going to scale up capacity they're going to come in and fill a niche and they're going to deliver a shit ton of hard drives that could be being used by fast but we don't have the capability to uh and so when you look at this like from a pure supply chain
*23:57*

**Jason Vallery**: I mean I already heard Microsoft's deploying hard drives into New Jersey not flash
*24:30*

**Jason Vallery**: they're going to be able to get exabytes and exabytes and exabytes of hard drives
*24:35*

**Jason Vallery**: they're not going to get the flash so in that world if you think about it from a workload
*24:38*

**Jason Vallery**: and an architecture perspective opening eyes been running successfully on hard drives for a long time
*24:43*

**Jason Vallery**: by being really intelligent about how they move the data in and out of the GPU cluster
*24:47*

**Lior Genzel**: Yeah.
*24:50*

**Jason Vallery**: this flash scarcity is going to encourage that architecture and in that world we lose to Azure storage
*24:51*

**Lior Genzel**: Okay, so better together, if we find a technical way to collaborate with the by, it's with Azure, but also with the by force, right? Like with all of those guys by for us, then it's the HDD SSD. So.
*24:59*

**Jason Vallery**: Well, and that's what it would look like.
*25:15*

**Jason Vallery**: Potentially, like if we had really good blob offload and tiering, you would be interacting from a performance tier with VAST,
*25:18*

**Jason Vallery**: and then we would lazily be moving stuff to hard drives for capacity and scale and cost.
*25:24*

**Lior Genzel**: So we are the performance there. We create data tiering into Azure Blob. We have an Azure Blob interface. Or at least we can move data, you know, data that is accessing us with file because we're multi-protocol can move Azure Blob into Azure Blob. And then even if the first deployment is only us, because at the beginning you need to build the first performance there, but it doesn't have to be only us. It can be a mix. So we can win next to them.
*25:28*

**Lior Genzel**: We can win with them winning. And then when flesh is not a concern anymore, they stop winning with us. So that's something to like, in the table I hold down, we need to find a way to win together with them. Like going against Manish, like he has nothing to lose. Here, you know, he has something to lose because there is a path that he doesn't lose everything. He's just using us for something that we're better for. And then in a way, in his mind, he has time to figure out how to replace us and how to take us out.
*25:57*

**Jason Vallery**: I can't
*26:22*

**Lior Genzel**: And in our mind, we have time to take him out. So that's triggered for us the follow-up with Vamji that we talked about last week where I spoke about it with Carl earlier today. So now I'm in a position to send an email to Vamji and to Ong, right? And say, we want to discuss this Azure Blob integration. If you want to share with me some paragraphs that I can use to be very clear about what we're driving to and what type of
*26:26*

**Jason Vallery**: I can't wait for
*26:41*

**Lior Genzel**: meeting do we want to have with them? I will be the one sending the email, the lead goes back to you. Right? And I think it's of highest priority for this project, now even more than we thought about before with Flash HDD. And it's also a priority for any solution we do on cloud, like all of the other solutions, even the marketplace solutions. If we have something that is really integrated with Azure Blob, it changes dramatically the way we can operate on cloud. So it's a huge win for us. Again, it's
*26:56*

**Jason Vallery**: Yeah.
*27:22*

**Jason Vallery**: So this is, I'm going to write up the design doc this week. I'm going to review with Jeff by Friday. I've already started it. Of the three areas of integration. One is an API surface and what the minimum viable product looks like there. One is offload transparently and one, like being able to manage a transparent namespace with Blob. And then the other is sort of offloading for Blob as a capacity tier that's vast optimized data format. So those are kind of like the three different ways of integration.
*27:29*

**Jason Vallery**: that I think are important. I'll have that all documented by the end of the week. Now the question then is the coaching I got earlier on when I was having these conversations even when I was in Tel Aviv with Shahar and with Asaf and folks was really the purchase order is what kicks off the dev pipeline here. In order for us to say yes we're going to go build those things on the other side of it there's a customer saying I'm going to use it and I'm ready to sign the purchase order.
*27:59*

**Lior Genzel**: That's true. Not in this case. So it's true. It's true. Look, it's true. But if we think about it, even if you get all resources marching orders, you finish the document, you sit down with Microsoft, you know, past holidays, beginning of January, you get to have a full agreement with them on the plan and the values and everything, because it can't be one-sided. They need to also appreciate what we're doing, right?
*28:27*

**Jason Vallery**: I feel like there's a yeah that's the that's the state like we have we have to go get it done as the thing that unlocks winning a purchase order from my
*28:29*

**Lior Genzel**: to be a part of it. Then you start coding mid-January. They're going to make a decision buying us or not mid-January. So, you know, if we get to learn mid-January that they're going with Azure Blob 100% and we lost MAI, then this, this project is not going to start. All the planning is going to go into another shelf and people will invest in something else because we were just blocked from MAI and now Microsoft is back to marketplace and marketplace is $20 million upside, not a billion.
*28:56*

**Lior Genzel**: But in a way, the timeline you are at right now, you can think of it as it's going to be done. Because you're going to get a yay or nay by mid-January from them. So timeline is perfect for you. You don't agree.
*29:26*

**Jason Vallery**: I was no I think I mean I
*29:41*

**Jason Vallery**: feel like we won't have a year in January if I'm honest I feel like Microsoft just doesn't move that fast I
*29:45*

**Jason Vallery**: think Apollo won't be decided until the summer and I don't think even MAI will be decided until then at scale and
*29:51*

**Jason Vallery**: what the long-term storage solution looks like.
*29:58*

**Lior Genzel**: So you're saying they're not going to start a deployment in March, they will push it? I'm with you, but the first inning, the first inning, if they need to make a decision,
*30:00*

**Jason Vallery**: I'm saying that just because we either win or don't win a small deployment in Nebius to begin with, it isn't the game-set match of the whole relationship. It is the first inning of a nine-inning baseball game that we're about to play with Microsoft.
*30:03*

**Lior Genzel**: for what are they doing there in March, unless it's going to be pushed again, because at the beginning they said they want to have something up and running in January. Now the up and running move from January to May. Maybe the up and running will move from May to September, and there is no decision in January. But this first inning is big enough to get the engineering aligned behind your plan, right? I don't want to give up as well, but then it's a different fight, right? If they didn't decide, mid-January,
*30:26*

**Jason Vallery**: I'm just saying I don't want to give up on it if we lose in January.
*30:46*

**Jason Vallery**: Yeah.
*30:52*

**Lior Genzel**: If they didn't decide, then I think Renan is going to say we're doing it. He will bet that that's how he's going to win the deal. And Microsoft is representing the biggest potential deal we have into next year next to OpenAI. So he will bet and he will say we're doing it. Yeah, I know, I know. So if we didn't win, he will bet on it, right? If they say no, we're not working with you, he will bet against it because a no is a no, right? Then priorities is,
*30:57*

**Jason Vallery**: OpenAI would use these same features, by the way.
*31:12*

**Lior Genzel**: where priorities are. But that's how it plays out, right? So we don't need to get the PO in January or a yes in January for us to move. We need not to get a no. That's the only scenario that he might not do it. If we get a no, you guys are not going to be a part of MAI project, then it might be a no because then he will say, you know, they're going to do everything they can to block us. Why focus on something that doesn't have a business upside? That's the only logic here, but we're not there yet. So hopefully we don't get a no.
*31:26*

**Jason Vallery**: So the next piece of this, there is no on-premises blob API. There's a little bit of a test harness that somebody created in open source called Azure Write. There is no storage vendor on earth that
*31:56*

**Jason Vallery**: that have implemented the Blob API other than Microsoft. There's no on-prem Google
*32:12*

**Jason Vallery**: distributed cloud version of the Blob API, none of that. So there's business opportunity beyond MAI and OpenAI for customers that heavily leverage Blob and want to be able to deploy on-prem. So that's first key opportunity for us to highlight and figure out how we can bring that to Microsoft's attention. But I actually think Vomchi will not take us building a Blob API
*32:20*

**Jason Vallery**: API as a positive.
*32:42*

**Jason Vallery**: I could see it going either way honestly, but I know Vamshi and I know he knows me and I know he knows why I want a blob API.
*32:46*

**Jason Vallery**: And what he will see that is as potentially a threat because it allows us to be the owner of the data relationship.
*32:54*

**Jason Vallery**: And the layered piece of that that's a threat is if we store the data inside of blob using opaque file structures and data structures.
*33:04*

**Jason Vallery**: And so if you've got us with the API and we're storing things in vast optimized data structures, it's best for us, worse for Vanshee. Because he's potentially been losing business to us. And that could be part of the marketplace story. That could be how we roll out more broadly. It's how we integrate with Foundry. It's how we just tell an Azure storage all up, story all up. I don't know that he's actually going to respond positively to us doing this work.
*33:11*

**Lior Genzel**: Is he going to block us and not give us resources to partner or is he just not going to like it? Like, you know, we are driving blow consumption. Say it.
*33:36*

**Jason Vallery**: I don't know what he'll do. I honestly don't know how he'll respond to it. What he would want us to do is offload the blob for sure, but he'd want us to do it in a transparent way without being opaque in the data structures, and he'd want us to bring an S3 API and an NFS endpoint and not a blob endpoint. I'm sure that would be his preferred set of outcomes.
*33:45*

**Lior Genzel**: I think that that's a... I think it makes sense that it will be against seeing us creating a solution that is taking away his business. But we openly spoke with him about it, that the only way for us, because of the cost structure on Azure,
*34:05*

**Lior Genzel**: The only way for us to be building a marketplace offering is the ability to have the right integration with Azure Blob. And we need to make the integration something that works for our solution. It's our engineering. So I don't see how we can push back against that. I can see how he doesn't like us getting into MAI and trying to take him out of the project. That's clearly a, you know, head-to-head battle. But here, who says we need to use, you know, we need to listen to him. At the end, we're consuming his Azure Blob. Every deal we create is business
*34:26*

**Jason Vallery**: Yeah.
*34:37*

**Lior Genzel**: for him. And, you know, he can continue building his first party to take business away from us, which is legit. He's doing it anyhow. And the good news for him is even when he loses, we're still winning. Still getting POs. So, you know, I don't see that as a concern. You know, the on-prem stuff, again, will he be credited for stuff we build on-prem? He won't. But again, he cannot push against it because it gives Azure customers the ability to use the same interface on-prem.
*34:56*

**Jason Vallery**: Yeah.
*35:08*

**Jason Vallery**: Yeah.
*35:26*

**Lior Genzel**: So that's a blessing from their point of view. You should actually, you cannot block that one as well. It's just, it's idiotic to block that one. So again, I see that less of a concern. Question is, you're writing all these documents internally. What is the optimal process with Microsoft to prep that, to put it in their attention? Do we need to follow up now? Do you want to follow up on that after the holidays? Like I, I thought that putting their attention of, of the integration project is if we're doing it for the market.
*35:26*

**Jason Vallery**: No.
*35:32*

**Lior Genzel**: which is kind of the way we can position it right is good because it will take their attention it will show them that we are working for on marketplace it will show them that we are committed for this journey which is exactly what vamji asked for and in parallel we're continuing to do whatever we want to do with mai right so you know and if he blocks us and doesn't partner then it's an indication that we really broke the relationship with him but i think he does want to follow up on that so what's the next move internally
*35:57*

**Lior Genzel**: I got it by end of the week.
*36:26*

**Jason Vallery**: Yeah, I mean, I think what I would like to have is us get to the point where we've made
*36:27*

**Jason Vallery**: design decisions or at least have a highly opinionated design that we want to finalize and then give him and his team an opportunity to do a design review and say this is what we're planning on building any feedback and you know that we're not going to get to the point where we're ready to do that i don't think until january um so at this point it would just be to reiterate we're working through a design on how we'll deeply integrate with blob um and like he said in the meeting and he wasn't blown
*36:33*

**Jason Vallery**: I know blob storage better than he well certainly better than Carl and Vanshee and I could go and arm wrestle over blob storage internals every day and so it's not like he we need his opinion on how to design this I know how to design so at this point I think it is we get to a final proposed design and then we give them the opportunity to provide feedback and that likely is until January we could give them an early signal of what we're thinking which is which is the the next question I was going to bring which is
*37:03*

**Lior Genzel**: That's easy.
*37:29*

**Jason Vallery**: When you think about the S3 API, it's actually a fairly simple thing. It's not that complicated. The blob API, on the other hand, is an incredibly complicated thing. It has, well, it's got a lot to it. It's been built to handle a whole bunch of different workloads and scenarios, and it's evolved organically, and it's always been, like, Microsoft fully controlled, both the clients and the API. Like, if you think about the S3 API, it's kind of like a de facto standard, and everybody on Earth has something
*37:33*

**Lior Genzel**: Why is that?
*37:43*

**Jason Vallery**: that integrates with S3. So it had to be like a narrow scoped API that became a standard. Whereas because Blob has only been a Microsoft thing and Microsoft controls both the software clients and the service, they kind of co-evolved together. And so there are scenarios and tools is really what we want to say we support, not necessarily the API in order to get to a minimum viable product. We're essentially saying we want to support data movement tooling. We want to support analytics,
*38:03*

**Jason Vallery**: drivers for Hadoop. We want to support different scenarios and then kind of reverse backwards into what is the minimum set of APIs. And so I ask this in the context of what's necessary for MAI, what's necessary for Vaston Cloud, and where the TAM and market would sit with us long-term beyond just MAI in terms of what kinds of scenarios we'd want to support. I could certainly build out the MVP of what would MAI and OpenAI use and make that a very narrow set of APIs. But it would actually
*38:33*

**Jason Vallery**: cannot really allow us to address the majority of the Blob storage marketplace or our market opportunity TAM. So like how deep down the rabbit hole should I encourage us to go here and which specific kind of customer cohorts and segments should we unlock? And I'll put a very tactical question on this, which is analytics. Microsoft, the Blob API has a whole suite of APIs that are really purposefully built for Spark and Databricks.
*39:03*

**Jason Vallery**: Do we want to support those scenarios?
*39:33*

**Lior Genzel**: I think it's...
*39:36*

**Lior Genzel**: Knowing that it's so complicated now, the answer is kind of simple. We want to have a roadmap that gets us to everything, but the addressable customers we want to target are MAI and OpenAI in that order, and only MVP for MAI and OpenAI, because that's the project, like, that's the money that comes to us, right? Right now. So show a roadmap, show it, like, show everything that will come, but you, you know, you don't need to explain why you're phasing out kind of the features and plan to
*39:40*

**Jason Vallery**: Yeah. So.
*40:01*

**Lior Genzel**: Microsoft is probably smart enough to understand why you're doing that, right? But, you know, MVP is how quickly can we get to the level of integration that will satisfy MAI and OpenAI. That's MVP.
*40:10*

**Jason Vallery**: And then, like, we have to double-click within NAI and OpenAI. I actually have more familiarity with OpenAI, but I'll assume NAI is similar.
*40:23*

**Jason Vallery**: There's the training workloads, checkpointing and staging training data. So that's a very small set of APIs. But then there is actually MAI presumably has Spark pipelines. I know OpenAI has an entire team that built out a crazy data processing pipeline with Spark that uses the APIs I talked about. So if you actually go back, and I talked about this when we were meeting with Longsheet, I'm sure I've shared it in other contexts, there's kind of like GPU adjacent storage, and then there's
*40:31*

**Jason Vallery**: central lake houses and data lakes. And so really what we're saying is we want the MAI, OpenAI set of APIs to support training and storage. We don't want to go after MAI or OpenAI's data lakes in MVP. Yeah.
*41:01*

**Lior Genzel**: Yeah.
*41:02*

**Lior Genzel**: Training.
*41:07*

**Lior Genzel**: Yes, that's what I'm saying. Because the business that is addressable to us right now is there. Now, I can think of stuff like Wave and all that, like other customers, but it's just noise. Once we go through that journey, then we can start exploring which other big consumers of Azure Blob are doing training.
*41:11*

**Lior Genzel**: and they're locked into Azure. But once we give them an Azure API, maybe they're not locked anymore. Right? Maybe they can use it on one of the, you know, on the call with, which before then they, it was problematic. Like Wave did a POC of moving data for training into call with. And it sounds like we've decided to stay at Microsoft. So they got close for 70,000 GPUs or something like that from call with. And it sounds like the deal never happened and they went, went quiet. Now,
*41:38*

**Lior Genzel**: Moving the data from their assets on Azure was using Sync Engine, which is a sync application. It's not a smart, like it's not, it's not fun, right? So I guess with all the complexity, the egress fees of moving data and so on and so forth. But once you create something that is legitimately a good solution, then it makes life so much easier for customers to start using it. So I think training in general is where we start. That's MVP. By the way, I'm not sure if you're available in 17 minutes, but if you're
*42:08*

**Jason Vallery**: I can't wait for you.
*42:12*

**Lior Genzel**: If you are, join me. There is a call with the Google RFP team. They wanted to understand how we approach the RFP and how we answered it and what was the thinking process. So they didn't structure any questions prior. So I kind of know what was the approach, you know, on pricing and commitment and so on and so forth. So I can talk about it openly, but, you know, join me to see if, you know, if you can probably help. And I, they invited 10 people and I'm the only person on our side. So I don't want to be lonely.
*42:38*

**Jason Vallery**: Sure.
*42:40*

**Jason Vallery**: Yeah.
*43:01*

**Jason Vallery**: Yeah.
*43:07*

**Lior Genzel**: Okay, so last point here. So I'm going to follow up with Amji and say that we're planning to share a design document that we want to take the relationship to the next level, update. We are in the process of onboarding as a partner. We're stuck right now with Microsoft having an issue, an open ticket that is not resolved for the past two days. We're doing that. We've prioritized Azure over AWS as the second general availability cloud for Marketplace.
*43:07*

**Lior Genzel**: So it was supposed to be the third. It's now the second. So that's something good to share. We also shared it with our friend Carl earlier today. There are two potential deals that might close before the end of January for customers. EY is one of them. NBCU is the second one. I'm not counting UKMET. But UKMET started testing. They installed a cluster on LSV4s. It's a seven-node cluster in Sweden. And now they've installed another 12-node cluster today.
*43:37*

**Jason Vallery**: .
*44:05*

**Lior Genzel**: in the US East 2 or something like that. So they're playing around. So stuff is moving forward in on the front of what Famshiker is about. And I will just add it as another point. We'll be able to share something, you know, sooner than later. And once we share a design document, we'll have to set up a time to sit down and review. I think we should plan proactively for another Microsoft week, which this time includes Florida, Bay Area, and Redmond. So
*44:07*

**Jason Vallery**: I don't know.
*44:20*

**Jason Vallery**: Sure. You mean try to squeeze all three cities in one week? Like ours? Yeah, yeah. I mean...
*44:38*

**Lior Genzel**: Yes, we are vast.
*44:42*

**Lior Genzel**: So the week of the 5th of January is probably going to be a week where people are just getting back to work after the new year and nobody would want to be in it.
*44:46*

**Lior Genzel**: So the week of the 12th is the week I will aim for.
*44:54*

**Lior Genzel**: And maybe we'll start the week on the East Coast.
*44:58*

**Lior Genzel**: We'll do Florida. I'm not saying Monday Tuesday or whatever it is.
*45:02*

**Lior Genzel**: And we'll have some other meat on the bone before we go there because there will be some other work that will be done. But we'll target our friends from Florida. And then we'll move to the Bay Area maybe. And by then mapping MAI and understanding who are the guys we need to meet, right? And then we'll finish the visit in Redmond. This time we'll go to an Indian restaurant with Vamji and we'll hug him and say to him that we love him. So the week of the 12th is the target week in my mind.
*45:05*

**Jason Vallery**: I have a personal thing on the 15th, late in the day.
*45:31*

**Jason Vallery**: I just need to be back here by Thursday morning I guess I don't know.
*45:35*

**Lior Genzel**: Okay, so we have three days. We have three days. Look, Florida is not more than a day and you can fly out that day. And then the question is, what do we do Tuesday and Wednesday? Or the other side, maybe Florida becomes Wednesday. And... Okay.
*45:41*

**Jason Vallery**: I can make Monday do Wednesday work.
*45:41*

**Jason Vallery**: Yeah, Thursday was like I was flying back to Colorado.
*45:54*

**Jason Vallery**: I can make as long as I did like an early afternoon flight.
*45:57*

**Jason Vallery**: So I could meet even there Thursday morning.
*46:00*

**Jason Vallery**: Yeah.
*46:03*

**Jason Vallery**: Well, I mean, we'll just see what meetings we can nail down.
*46:04*

**Lior Genzel**: Yeah, so right now, again, I wrote it in the internal email. I really want to get the right mapping into MAI organization to understand how we play it out. And also, let's see if, and I took the action item on setting up the Mustafa meeting. The last point is compute. I think that if we prioritize it under the UK match name, I want to have a configuration for MAI with compute. It's a semi-win. And you know what?
*46:06*

**Jason Vallery**: Yeah.
*46:24*

**Lior Genzel**: But even if it's going to be blocked, then at least we can have the conversation with Vamji and saying, why are we trying to design MAI with our software on Eagle's hardware? Why not your hardware? I can ask that question. But it is to see that Eagle is something that can really make sense. And maybe that will trigger a thinking process with the storage team that it's time for them to give us access to better hardware. So there is nothing bad against it. I think you have the contact person or people computing. Yeah.
*46:35*

**Jason Vallery**: Thank you.
*46:51*

**Jason Vallery**: She shot me.
*47:00*

**Jason Vallery**: She shot me.
*47:01*

**Jason Vallery**: She shot?
*47:02*

**Lior Genzel**: I would say Eagle needs to be on the email. Meaning if you follow up with Eagle and say, Eagle, I want to have a call to discuss A, B, C, D, because I want to understand how do I build configurations with all the possibilities you guys can offer with LSV5 to follow up on the meeting we had. Who do you want from your team on the call? He will invite all the right people. He works for Eagle. He's one of the people. But I think for this type of exercise, Eagle,
*47:05*

**Jason Vallery**: Right, so, well, was this guy Shushant that you introduced me to? He's in Egals.
*47:24*

**Lior Genzel**: to name the people. And he might name four or five other people. So I would say send an email to EGAL and tell him to call the email UKMET and LSV5. Kind of configuration exercising. Be specific about what you want to ask. And ask him who should be on the call and if he can suggest a day and time for that. And then he will, if he doesn't reply, I will put his admin on the thread and I will push him to move it forward. He is afraid of the Indian mafia because he's a middle-aged white person working in Redmond.
*47:35*

**Lior Genzel**: I'm following your lead now. But as long as it's UKMAT, and as long as I told him, once it's ready, I will share an email with him and saying, by the way, we want to use it for MAI. Do I get your approval to send an email to Vamji and to show it to Vamji and to open a discussion? And then he has nothing to object against. So we'll protect him. Check to see if you have it in your calendar. I kind of duplicated the meeting because it wasn't my invite.
*48:05*

**Jason Vallery**: Yeah. Okay. Sounds like a plan. You sent me the Google invite. Let me see. Is that here?
*48:25*

**Lior Genzel**: So we'll talk again in 11 minutes.
*48:35*

**Jason Vallery**: Yeah, I got it. All right. Thank you, sir. Talk soon. Bye.
*48:37*

**Lior Genzel**: Thank you, bye.
*48:43*

**Lior Genzel**: Thank you.
*49:30*
