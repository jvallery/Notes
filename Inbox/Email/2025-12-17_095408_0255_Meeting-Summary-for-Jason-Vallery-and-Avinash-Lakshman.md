# Meeting Summary for Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman- Exported: 2026-01-04 17:25:04- Messages: 1---## 2025-12-17 09:54:08 — Meeting Summary with AI Companion <no-reply@zoom.us>**Subject:** Meeting Summary for Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman> ￼ > > > Meeting summary for Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman (12/17/2025) > > > Quick recap> Avinash presented Whale Iptic's platform, which offers a globally distributed compute platform with virtual sandbox environments for AI agents and Web2 applications, including their Icarus conversational agent and Cerebrum SDK for trust-aware agent orchestrator. The platform's multi-pod architecture across cloud providers ensures service reliability, while their distributed ledger system provides data sovereignty and fault tolerance through custom BFT consensus algorithms. Jason and Avinash discussed VAST's storage solutions for enterprises and their potential integration with GPU infrastructure and distributed ledger technology, including plans for expanding capabilities and exploring secure, verifiable agent execution in global state scenarios.> Next steps> Jason: Send Avinash a follow-up email with public links and information about VAST's current and upcoming capabilities.> Avinash: Review the information sent by Jason and consider how Whale Iptic's platform could be integrated or aligned with VAST's roadmap, and potentially follow up with ideas or proposals.> Summary> Whale Iptic's Secure Compute Platform> Avinash explained Whale Iptic's platform, which provides a globally distributed, cryptographically secure compute platform with virtual sandbox environments for AI agents and Web2 applications. He described their two main offerings: Icarus, a virtual conversational agent that can interact with enterprise-grade systems, and Cerebrum, an SDK for trust-aware agent orchestrator with fine-grained authorization control and auditability. Avinash also demonstrated their multi-pod architecture running across AWS, GCP, and Azure, designed to prevent service disruptions from single cloud provider outages.> Secure LLM Management Platform Demo> Avinash demonstrated a platform that hosts MCP servers and can manage LLMs through cloud providers' services, showcasing a chatbot deployed on this infrastructure. He explained how the platform ensures secure and auditable interactions by using digital signatures and identity-based wallets in the browser, contrasting this with traditional TLS security methods. Jason raised concerns about the necessity of a browser agent for security, to which Avinash clarified that the agent's role is minimal and focused on identity management, emphasizing the platform's unique ability to provide full auditability and visibility of actions.> Neocloud Storage and AI Integration> Avinash explained his distributed ledger system that ensures data sovereignty and fault tolerance across cloud regions, built on custom BFT consensus algorithms. Jason shared VAST's vision to move up the value stack by combining their storage platform with an AI agent engine, particularly addressing the needs of enterprises with data lakes in hyperscalers and GPUs spread across multiple neoclouds. Both discussed the growing number of neoclouds, with VAST seeing an opportunity to provide a complete "neocloud in a box" solution to address the varying maturity levels of these new cloud providers.> VAST Storage Solutions Overview> Jason discussed VAST's role in providing storage solutions for companies like XAI, Tesla, and CoreWeave, emphasizing its use in training data and model distribution for large language models. He highlighted VAST's presence in various sectors, including hedge funds, supercomputers, and national labs, catering to both cloud and on-premises customers. The focus is on enabling hyperscalers and neoclouds to deploy quickly on commodity infrastructure, generating revenue without extensive build-out.> GPU-Blockchain Integration Strategy Discussion> Jason and Avinash discussed the potential of integrating GPU infrastructure with distributed ledger technology to enable secure, verifiable, and observable agent execution in a global state scenario. Jason highlighted a recent $1.2 billion deal with VAST to deliver infrastructure and shared plans for expanding capabilities, including stablecoin issuance and agent e-commerce. Avinash expressed interest in exploring these possibilities further and requested access to public information on the current development status, which Jason agreed to provide via email. Both agreed to maintain communication and continue the dialogue.> > AI-generated content may be inaccurate or misleading.
