The relationships, the teamwork, and the amazing ability to turn around responses and get Leidos the the technical information they needed quickly was evident. Biggest shout out to FSI Leader Jenn Azzolina for establishing relationships w/ key leadership staff early on in the process, could not have gotten this far without her guidance and Federal System Integrator experience. Shout out to my SE Mark Maynard for doing so many technical briefs I lost count. Another shout out to Fed Civilian Director Sean O'Donnell for attending the Leidos Civ leadership meetings which helped to get buy-in from those teams. Thanks to Fed Field Tech Director Jeno Cram and FSI SE Manager Steve Hill for attending all those briefings with the team and fielding technical curve ball questions time and time again. Big thanks to CTO Matt Rogers & AI Enterprise Lead Ofir Zan for a slew of AI and Security briefs & workshops we had to do along the way. Can't forget DoD AE Justin Bradd and his SE Mark Supplee for assisting in the on-prem installation at the Leidos Gaithersburg facility - clutch assist that really helped us move this forward internally w/ Leidos. Also can't forget Sales Ops in this as I finagled my way around SFDC to get this all to the finish line - Thanks to Felipe Escuton, Dee Berar, Ali P, & the spectacular Georgie Rager for all the assists. And lastly,... shout out to Randy Hayes for stepping up for the random technical briefs that would come out of the blue w/ Leidos VP's and CTO leadership. Thanks to all for helping to get this done.> > NOTE: The information contained in this communication (including attachments) may be confidential, is intended only for the use of the recipient named above, and may be legally privileged.
