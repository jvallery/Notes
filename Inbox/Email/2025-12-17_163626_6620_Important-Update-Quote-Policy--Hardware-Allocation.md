As a reminder, we are working in an incredibly dynamic environment which presents both challenges and opportunities. We will continue to communicate in real time to help you get your deals booked and keep your customers informed as things change.> > To help keep deals progressing smoothly:> Place Orders as early as possible — this allows them to enter the allocation queue sooner > Keep SFDC up to date so we maintain a clear view of demand > Build configurations with the HW on hand whenever possible. These Orders will be fulfilled more quickly.  > > > > > > Summary: New Quote Policy> > Quote expiry> Any order placed by December 31 will be honored at the quoted price. All outstanding quotes will lapse on December 31, 2025.  > Quote validity period> We are releasing monthly price books going forward, with the option to update prices mid-month. Any quotes issued and approved with an active price book are valid for the calendar month in which they are issued. > > For example, a quote approved on January 10, 2026 will be valid through January 31, 2026 and will lapse on February 1, 2026.   > Accepted POs> Accepted purchase orders will be honored.  > Large deals> Any deal larger than 15 PB requires deal desk sign-off prior to quoting. Only synched quotes are eligible for review. Please note, Deal Desk will be meeting every day (including weekends as necessary) to ensure fast turnaround of quotes.  > Hardware acceptance> Customers are expected to accept hardware when our hardware partners are ready to ship. If a customer delays acceptance, our hardware partners may revise their pricing. > > Software pricing> Have confidence and conviction in the value we give to customers, take every opportunity to increase our software pricing.> > > > > > > Important Reminders: > Partial Licensing is no longer an option > All POCs must be paid > Accurate planning enables us and our hardware partners to deliver for customers when it matters most. For all late-stage opportunities, all budgetary quotes must be synced to ensure visibility and execution. > > This remains a highly dynamic environment. We will continue to communicate proactively as conditions evolve and will work closely with customers to navigate timing, availability, and next steps.> > 1Team!>  > Rick> > > ---
