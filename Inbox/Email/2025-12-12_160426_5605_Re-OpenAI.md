> Rockset is the name of the company that OAI acquired which was founded by the guys who started the OSS RocksDB (Venkat Venkataramani). In a sense, what they have is RocksDB (https://rocksdb.org/) managing the persistence on local SSDs + FoundationDB (https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/index.html) for KV semantics over the top. This system is the “memory” of ChatGPT.  It’s like a KV-cache, but more of persistent a KV-store. OpenAI talked publicly about the GPT-6 roadmap and this being a key innovation/unlock. 
> The comment about the research data platform is an in-house developed system they refer to as DAQ (short for Data Acquisition).  This was brought up to is in the conversation we had with Misha. It drives crazy TPS/PiB. There is a guy named Louis Feuvrier who is the lead developer/architect on this system. 
> There is one other “big data” team in OpenAI they refer to as “Data Platform”.  This is where all the Spark/Databricks workloads sit. This is ran by a woman named Emma Tang.
