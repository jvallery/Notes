**Journal subtemplate**

Context: private dictation—freeform thinking.

Priorities:
- Distill **insights**, hypotheses, and concrete **next actions**.
- Convert “I should / we should” statements into explicit tasks with owners (use `"Myself"` if unspecified).
- Extract references to people/projects as **key_facts** but keep participants empty unless real attendees are present.

Style:
- Keep the summary crisp; avoid personal fluff unless it informs actions or decisions.
