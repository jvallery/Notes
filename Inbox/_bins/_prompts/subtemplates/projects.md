**Projects subtemplate**

Context: internal project discussion (planning, execution, review).

Priorities:
- Convert status to **milestones**, **dependencies**, **owners**, and **dates**.
- Extract **decisions** with rationale; note reversibility where relevant.
- Identify **risks** with clear mitigations and triggers.

Tasks:
- Use atomic, testable tasks. Include due dates only when explicit or inferable.

Next meeting:
- If cadence or date is set (e.g., weekly standup), set `next_meeting_date`; else leave empty.
