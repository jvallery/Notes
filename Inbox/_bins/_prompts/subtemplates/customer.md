**Customer subtemplate**

Context: multi-attendee customer meeting (project in-flight, requirements, or briefing).

Priorities:
- Separate **requirements** (customer asks) from **proposed solutions** and **decisions**.
- Record **customer constraints** (budget, timeline, security, compliance, architecture).
- Note **buying process signals** (stakeholders, approvers, next steps).
- If the extra context contains an attendee list, use it as the base and add only clearly additional participants from the transcript.

Tasks & Follow-ups:
- Distinguish **customer-owned** vs **our-owned** vs **partner-owned** actions via the `owner` field.

Risks:
- Capture blockers to adoption or deal progression (technical, commercial, legal).

Next meeting:
- If a date is discussed, set `next_meeting_date`. Otherwise, leave it empty.
