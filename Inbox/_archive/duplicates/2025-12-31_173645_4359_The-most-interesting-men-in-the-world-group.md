After some thought about next year and "book club", the things I have enjoyed the most are having great convos around books, and some of the going out things like escape rooms and dinner.> > To that end, I am going to retire the book club. Next spring I'd like to start TMIMITW with a slightly smaller invite list. I propose we look at monthly?, and be a bit flexible. The goal is still to read interesting things and have some good discussion, but also maybe do a quarterly dinner or beers or something?> > Maybe look to start either Jan 27th or Feb 3? I know Brandon will be out for a bit, we can start anyway. > > This was a suggestion:> https://www.amazon.com/dp/1546006354/?bestFormat=true&k=the%20immortal%20mind&ref_=nb_sb_ss_w_scx-ent-bk-ww_k0_1_9_de&crid=2EBVVK21WMVOB&sprefix=the%20immor> > And I got this for Christmas and it looks pretty interesting as well:> https://www.amazon.com/Fashionable-Nonsense-Postmodern-Intellectuals-Science/dp/0312204078/ref=pd_ci_mcx_mh_mcx_views_0_title?pd_rd_w=DHyq8&content-id=amzn1.sym.679481c3-2bf4-4843-80c0-ffb319282e84%3Aamzn1.symc.c3d5766d-b606-46b8-ab07-1d9d1da0638a&pf_rd_p=679481c3-2bf4-4843-80c0-ffb319282e84&pf_rd_r=13KFPSCEQ487HK0H470J&pd_rd_wg=zwmMe&pd_rd_r=76aed3ba-d22d-44bd-bcc1-ca9814345a1a&pd_rd_i=0312204078> > > Thoughts on this plan??> > David> > ---
