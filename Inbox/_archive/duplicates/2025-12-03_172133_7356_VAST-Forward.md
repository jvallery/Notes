I want to build on that by highlighting the incredible participation we are seeing from the people who matter most: the customers and partners who are betting on us.> Our customers are stepping up in a big way. Leaders from Pixar, Lowe’s, NHL, Leidos, Aquatic, T-Mobile, and others will be on stage to talk about how they are using VAST to transform their environments. These are not lightweight conversations. These are real AI pipelines, real production outcomes, and real competitive advantage. When customers choose to tell their stories publicly and at our first global conference, it is one of the strongest signals of trust we can earn as a company.> Our partners are showing up as well. Cisco, Arrow, Acceldata, HPE, Cambridge Computer, Government Acquisitions, Starfish and more are investing their time, brand, and resources to stand alongside us. Their sponsorship is not just financial support. It is validation of the category we are building and the leadership position we are taking together.> This is the essence of One Team. Our customers, our partners, and all of us across Sales, Marketing, Support, and Product are aligned around a single mission and a level of momentum that continues to accelerate.> Now we need to harness that momentum.> Every customer who attends VAST Forward will walk away more confident in their strategy, deeper in their understanding of our platform, and more committed to VAST as their long-term partner. That impact starts with your outreach. Your accounts trust you to guide them toward the opportunities that matter.> Here is where we need your help:> > Share the agenda directly>  with your accounts.> > > Highlight the customers and partners speaking who will resonate most with them.> > > Encourage them to take advantage of onsite > certification,>  hands-on labs, and direct access to our product and leadership teams.> > > Position this event as a chance to accelerate their roadmap and deepen their relationship with us.> > > Nominate customers>  for the VIP Ski Experience at SnowBasin, an exclusive opportunity for select guests to connect with VAST while enjoying a world-class experience.> This conference will be one of the strongest proof points of the ecosystem we are building. Let us show up together, drive attendance together, and win together.> One team. One message. One VAST.> Rick>  > ---
