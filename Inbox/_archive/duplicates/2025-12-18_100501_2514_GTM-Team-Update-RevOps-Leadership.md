Cristina has been an important part of our journey, helping us build the foundation of a strong, world-class Revenue Operations function during a period of significant growth and change. > We’re incredibly grateful for the work Cristina has done and the mark she’s left on the team. We wish her nothing but the best as she heads into her next chapter.> In the interim, Stacy Wynn will be stepping in to lead the RevOps team while we begin the search for a new leader. Our priorities remain unchanged, the team is well supported, and we’ll continue moving forward together without missing a beat.> Thank you for your continued focus and collaboration as we move forward.> 1Team,> Rick> > BCC: All GTM, All CS> > ---
