DGX Cloud is now leveraging VAST across more than five NCPs and managing multiple petabytes of capacity, with continued expansion expected. Each NCP provides telemetry and dashboards differently—some more mature than others—resulting in inconsistent visibility and complicating troubleshooting and ongoing platform maintenance.> > Performance metrics and rapid time-to-recover from issues are critical for keeping very large GPU fleets and thousands of NVIDIA developers productive and satisfied. The current fragmented visibility model increases operational friction, delays root-cause analysis, and negatively impacts developer experience and platform reliability.> > > This request consists of two components:> > Here's one example from single NCP however there are many.> > 1. Dual-Uplink Visibility for a Dedicated Cluster (LAX-02):> > The Uplink lambda.cloud.vastdata.com (NCP) currently has the VAST cluster LAX-02 assigned to it.> LAX-02 is fully dedicated to NVIDIA DGX-Cloud (DGXC) — there are no other tenants or customers using this cluster. Because it is a single-tenant, DGXC-exclusive deployment, NVIDIA DGXC is requesting that the same cluster (LAX-02) also be assigned to their Uplink:nvidiadgxc.cloud.vastdata.com> > Request:> Allow both Uplinks — lambda.cloud.vastdata.com and nvidiadgxc.cloud.vastdata.com — to receive visibility into the same LAX-02 cluster.> > 2. Tenant-Scoped Visibility for a Multi-Tenant Cluster (LAX-03)> > The same NCP Uplink (lambda.cloud.vastdata.com) also manages the multi-tenant cluster LAX-03.> Inside LAX-03, there is a DGX-Cloud tenant that belongs to NVIDIA.> DGXC is requesting that only their tenant’s information (metrics, workloads, configurations, health, etc.) be accessible via their Uplink: nvidiadgxc.cloud.vastdata.com> > Request:> Enable tenant-filtered visibility so that the NVIDIA Uplink shows only DGXC’s tenant data from LAX-03, without exposing any other tenants or cluster-wide information.> > Deal Blocker: No> > > Value Proposition:> > > Additional $$ from RFE: $100,000,000> Additional PB from RFE: 10,000> > How is the RFE Beneficial for VAST:> Delivering this functionality deepens VAST’s strategic alignment with NVIDIA, reinforces trust, and expands VAST’s long-term footprint within the DGX Cloud ecosystem.> > Expected Outcome from Feature deployment:> Requested Capability:> DGX Cloud is seeking a common, unified dashboard or visibility layer that aggregates operational telemetry, performance metrics, health status, alerts, and other relevant data across all VAST clusters deployed at the various NCPs. This consolidated view would significantly streamline troubleshooting, improve maintenance workflows, accelerate recovery times, and ensure consistent visibility across the DGX Cloud footprint.> > Although the primary focus is DGX Cloud, this capability could also serve as a value-added service for NCPs and their other customers, enhancing overall operational insight and supportability.> This assumes NCPs are using VAST Uplink. If such a capability were available, DGX Cloud would make support for this feature a formal requirement in the NCP PRD.> > > ---
