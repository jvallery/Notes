An "all-flash everything" strategy for exabyte-scale data is economically dangerous. By integrating deeply with Azure Blob, we allow customers to lean on HDD based object storage for the massive tail of their dataset, reserving high-premium VAST flash strictly for the GPU-adjacent working set. This provides a hedge against component volatility.> > ￼> Jonsi Stefansson • 9:51 AM, Jan 2 (MST)New> Should we have a firmer statement here about how VAST unique DRR / efficiencies will reduce the supply chain issue greatly?> Open> Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA  You have received this email because you are a participant in the updated items or subscribed to notifications on VAST and Azure Integration.docx.
