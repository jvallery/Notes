# 20251027 0636 Parallels Transcription

**Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Participants:** Jason Vallery, Lior, Yonsi, Rony, Roner

## Summary

Team aligned on making UK Met Office successful with dual paths: Plan A on Azure Compute (new 800 Gb/300 TB VM) and Plan B via Specialized/ODM hardware. UK Met has verbally selected VAST pending software and performance validation; they expect a Microsoft compute answer mid‑November. Access for testing on Azure is targeted for the first week of December. Product/GTM needs crisp GA criteria (spin up/down, DR/offload) and a clear roadmap toward SaaS and object offload. Competitive comparisons vs Managed Lustre, Weka, and Hammerspace will be assembled. Additional motions: GCP nearing GA, Two Sigma meeting on 2025-11-12, Zoom request on OCI pending apples-to-apples scope.

## Key facts learned

- UK Met expects Azure VM with 800 Gb network and 300 TB local SSD; they currently test on 200 Gb VMs and extrapolate linearly.
- Microsoft: testing hardware expected Q1 CY; production Q2 CY; final spec confirmation expected mid‑November from Igal’s group.
- UK Met has verbally selected VAST pending software/perf; they need something to test by early December.
- Plan A: VAST on Azure Compute; Plan B: VAST on Specialized/ODM hardware to de-risk timelines.
- Estimated per‑VM targets used: ~5 GB/s read and ~2 GB/s write at 100 Gb front‑end (for modeling).
- Managed Lustre reportedly ~20% cheaper list but likely not UK Met’s preferred direction.
- UK Met has tested Weka and Hammerspace on LSV4 due to lack of VAST software access.
- GCP performance bottleneck removed; GA expected soon with lighthouse customers.
- Two Sigma meeting set for 2025-11-12 to discuss Google POC; ICE/NYSE AWS POC technically successful but deferred cloud adoption for maturity.
- Zoom on OCI exploring training stack; decision depends on apples-to-apples VM comparison and TCO viability.
- GA gating capabilities discussed: spin up/down clusters, DR/offload to object, and clear SaaS roadmap.

## Outcomes

- Proceed with dual-track approach for UK Met: Azure Compute (primary) and Specialized/ODM (contingency).
- Target providing UK Met Azure testing access in the first week of December.
- Jason to be added to UK Met weekly sync and connected to MS Managed Lustre performance lead and internal UK Met spec team.
- Product to define GA criteria and a credible roadmap (MVP now, SaaS/offload later) ahead of February SCO enablement.
- Gather competitive performance and TCO comparisons vs Managed Lustre, Weka, and Hammerspace on equivalent VM types.

## Decisions

- Pursue Plan A (Azure Compute) and Plan B (Specialized/ODM) concurrently for UK Met.
- Defer aggressive field marketing until MVP/GA criteria are defined, while advancing a few lighthouse projects per cloud.

## Risks

- Microsoft Compute may not deliver the 800 Gb/300 TB VM on time, jeopardizing UK Met.
- Performance on current LSV4 could underwhelm and erode confidence if expectations are mis-set.
- Competitive pressure from Weka/Hammerspace during VAST software access gap.
- Roadmap and messaging misalignment could reduce field trust and delay deals.
- Unclear requirements for DR/offload/hibernate could lead to wrong prioritization.
- Managed Lustre lower pricing may be used against VAST in TCO discussions.

## Open questions

- What is UK Met’s concrete Plan B if VAST on Azure Compute slips—beyond VAST Specialized/ODM?
- What are UK Met’s exact workload and I/O patterns for the next‑gen stack?
- Is the proposed 300 TB local SSD per VM QLC‑based, and what are the performance implications?
- When is the right time to start external marketing for cloud MVP, and what is the definitive GA criteria?
- Should Hibernate-to-object be prioritized before full offload, and is it materially valuable for early customers?
- How does Managed Lustre performance and TCO compare to VAST on equivalent VM types for UK Met?
- Will Zoom evaluate VAST on OCI using apples‑to‑apples VM configs, and can we be cost‑competitive?
- What are the precise Azure deployment blockers encountered, and who owns resolving them?

[00:00:00.00]   RemoteHe and I think Jason is no. So I'm forwarding it right now again, Jason, and, let's see. Okay, so this email is, is something that I can at least talk about with Igor again tonight. What the conclusion there is that, again, we have right now the UKMET that have asked, again, this is based on UKMET, UKMET have asked the compute team for VMs, and it's written in the email that will be available at the end of 2026, and we'll have 800 gig of network. which is four times more than the AMD and LSD5, and 300 terabyte of local SSD, and right now, UK match team was expecting a final answer from Eagle mid-November. Based on the Shachar conversation from earlier this week, from yesterday, Shachar said that Eagle thinks that he's in full sync came at. There is always a gap between what UK Met Microsoft team says and what Eagle says. But Eagle said yesterday that they are in full sync and Eagle also included a comment that they also have a new VM in play which is based on QLC drives and they suggested that we talk with the product people at Microsoft. Now we have been talking with the product people at Microsoft and they didn't mention it. Maybe the 300 terabyte that they're discussing is QLC based. I don't know, but we'll figure it out this week. But right now the committed server that is coming is coming for testing in Q1 or calendar year, and it'll be ready for production in Q2 of next year. So when I look at our general availability, Q1 of next year. It's not testing. It might make sense just to be general availability on the new one, not on LSV4. Let's see. So that's the details, and the only one that care about performance, so back to UKMH, what are they saying? Like their logic, they're saying, if you're giving us a 200 gig VM and we're going to run performance testing, are limited by the network based on what we have shared with them on design and how eBooks works. So if we get x performance, our assumption is that with linear network scalability, we might get 4x performance with the new VM because it's going to be four times faster, right? So that's why they care about performance. Now we can come and say, hey guys, like you're testing v1. of our stuff and we can improve it by 30% or whatever, but that's so important. Performance is important for UK-MET testing day one, because they will extrapolate the numbers to see how it works with four times faster network. Does that make sense? capacity is that that UK is gonna want? So they flow for a number in the year which was 320 petabytes, petabytes right and and and then in the design they they were trying to figure out you know what type of data can sit on Azure Blob if any and what type of data can sit on our VMs But we went through a full process of sizing and TCO calculations, and we never had the cost of the VMs because it's Microsoft sending to Microsoft, and under the assumption that they can build VMs with 800 gig and 300 terabyte, Mike, on the other side, and Nico, said that with that VM, it's good enough for them to enable a solution based on BUS. The final solution is unclear. Say again. Who said what? Did anyone ask a question or was it just somebody?

[00:04:01.30]  Jason Vallery- I think it was in the background.

[00:04:03.88]   Remote- Ah, the clouds, okay.

[00:04:07.60]  Jason ValleryYou that his role is changing. He was on the storage PM time stream and now he's going to report to Mike directly to be 100% focused on UKMet.

[00:04:15.93]   RemoteYeah, he shared that. Niko and Mike are very, very friendly and very responsive. Not once, not twice, they've shared over the call that they have verbally selected VAST. and they're just waiting for the software, right? And they're just waiting to see that because we have estimated performance numbers. We didn't, again, estimate the wrong numbers or imaginary numbers. We estimated numbers based on capacity and based on that, we did the entire design. This 800 gig, 300 terabyte is based on what we pushed for on our side. Now, at the same time. since we're discussing UKMet, and I've asked our team, the VaST team, to suggest a configuration which is based on VaST ODM hardware, and I will follow up today to see that we can get it done, and I've reached out to Anand on the specialized team already. You're on the thread, Jason. I think Yonsi is also on the thread. Yeah, and I've asked, I've asked... team to accept our system so we can give UK Met Office access to vast ODM hardware now it's not it's not that I want to push it like I would love it to be you know compute but first off I didn't understand the final answer and the second off you know who knows if they will they will meet the timeline if compute meet the timeline and if it will work with UK Met so if they have a plan A and a plan B I want their plan A to be us on compute and plan B to be us on specialize not plan B to be someone else I want to be both plans so that's the logic behind following up with Anand. I mean that's exactly what we talked about Lior in order to speed things up and in order like the other thing is if they want to do any performance testing and it will be done on the existing LSV4, we will fail. Again, we will fail if we set the wrong expectations. I don't think we've set the wrong expectations. I think that we've set realistic expectations. and based on what we have, like again, if we set expectations that we cannot meet, as an example, we've set expectations that read performance can be offered at five gigabyte a second per VM, which is numbers that we, for assuming 100 gigabit front end. These are numbers that we've seen on VMs on other clouds, right? So there is no reason not to read that number, and we have set expectations that the right performance is about two gigabytes per second. Again, numbers that we've seen in other VMs. Now, we don't need to be at those numbers day one. But if the numbers we've set are not, you know, eye in the sky, if they are realistic numbers, based on what we have shared, they extrapolated the numbers, and they said, if you can build VMs on 800 gig, It's good enough. So we're not trying to be the fastest on cloud. We're just trying to be good enough for the requirement. So I'm not afraid of us failing the numbers I'm afraid of the computing not delivering VMs on time and then us losing the project What are the numbers that we shared for the LSV4? We didn't share LSV4. We took the 100 gig, I'm 100 gig network front-end numbers under the assumption that there is no compute bottleneck or NZME dry bottleneck in those design sessions. I think we did it a while back where Asaf was also a part of it and we looked at numbers that we got from Google and AWS and we estimated numbers based on the theory -10% of theory or whatever but it's here numbers that you already got on and it was all estimated numbers because we're estimating numbers on VMs that do not exist, so we can't do anything but estimate the numbers.

[00:08:02.03]  Jason ValleryI think the important thing is that, you know, no matter what solution they're evaluating, they're still built on the same commodity building blocks and so I don't see why a world where there's another solution out there that would outperform us using the same VM types, if you're constrained by that.

[00:08:17.07]   Remote- That's a question for ASAP, right? The question is, what are they looking for? Which other alternatives? And they have Lustre today. They've decided, they have HP Lustre today, right? Not Microsoft Lustre. I think they were very clear about the fact that they do not want to have Lustre again, and they don't want to look at... the Microsoft Managed Cluster as well. I really don't know, never got Mike to answer that question. What else are they considering as plan B if that doesn't work? I do know that since we didn't have any software to give them, and since we directed them to LSV4 as the right platform, they started testing with Weka and Amrspace in the past two months. So they're just testing and playing with it. Now, what will they get with Weka or Armorspace on the same VMs? I'm not strong enough technically to understand if it's more or less than us.

[00:09:10.87]  Jason Vallery- Yeah, I can say that managed Lustre runs on the same L-series VMs. So they're not gonna get any better hardware performance out of a managed Lustre.

[00:09:22.83]   RemoteSolution. But the Lustre deployment and I mean if you look at how like the managed Lustre is, they are actually using a premium SSD version 2. They're having attachable drives, and the Lustre is using the same... sure it's the same VMs but they're using VMs as front end and the storage is persistent storage running on the on on block storage so we're using local NVMe drives so I did some work there is that guy the German guy in the in the HPC performance team the Microsoft guy very friendly meeting him at supercomputing but I can put him Jason on on a call with you and it will walk you through the Luster, the Managed Luster implementation and all the performance bottlenecks of the way it works and pricing. I did that exercise with you just to understand where do we land on pricing against Managed Luster and where do we land on performance because Luster, because it's also a tiered approach with different backend options. They have high-performance option, they have regular option, and they have capacity option, which have different capacity sizing and different price points completely. But again, I don't think they want to go luster. I think they want to go vast, right? So I just don't know what's option B for them if it's not us. So I prefer to give them option B, vast specialized, option A, vast compute. - It can just rust.

[00:10:53.73]  Jason Vallery- Do we have an opinion about the Weka Hemispace comment of if it can outperform on the same hardware?

[00:11:03.79]   Remote- The only guy who can answer this stuff is a mute. I mean the technology is of course completely different. I mean Hammerspace is basically just like a proxy, an overlay on top of Blob right now. So I don't think from a performance perspective they stand a chance. if that's what they're doing. I think that we can have someone from the performance team setting a call internally with someone from the performance team to to get their opinion and Niko can probably also share numbers of what they've achieved on LSV4. Since we share theoretical numbers, I'm guessing that... it's slower than our numbers, because they're still excited to move forward, and we did share numbers of what we expect to get, and they've been running benchmark. So again, this is a guessing game. I don't like guessing. I like facts. So no, but I mean, ultimately, we need we need to establish a, you know, competitive comparison with all the offerings out you know, and how we do that and what part of the performance team is doing that. I mean, we are always going to be asked, you know, for competitive comparisons, and the other thing is, like in many cases, we don't need to be the fastest, especially with the ones that are. know true hybrid with our global namespace you know the the data engine and everything that we have but we still want to have those numbers and then we come with our additional value prop that is very unique compared to everybody else yeah the user story for the first nine out of ten customers is versed into clouds from one friend and for that as long as they get the right performance from us on cloud they will not we will not lose for them comparing us to others and the guy who is responsible for managed cluster performance and is this mentioned before he's friendly and he to run testing with us and help us build the TCO. From his point of view, he just wants to be able to position to the Microsoft Salesforce our numbers in a way that will be consistent with the reality of, you know, that's what he cares about. So I can set up a call with him or today, tomorrow, for him to share everything about Managed Cluster, performance. pricing configurations and he said, once you have access to a cluster unrelated to UKMH, I wanna get the Terraform script to install in my environment and I wanna help you and run my own performance testing to help you move it forward. So he's very, again, a friendly resource to work with. All right, let's see if I hold down any numbers when we spoke, but I can just, I was more focused on pricing. So you know, pricing, Managed Laster is less expensive than us on pricing as of today, but it's like 20% less expensive. So it's again-- Not the reason why somebody would decide to go Managed Lasso if he's a bus customer.

[00:14:41.75]  Jason ValleryWhat do we know about the UKMAT I/O patterns? What are the actual workload scenarios? Are they running large sequential reads and writes? A lot of random I/O?

[00:14:53.75]   RemoteWhat's the scenario? The best guy to talk with is the SE of UKMAT. of the above it's HPC it's an HPC use case for weather but I I don't want to answer something I don't have the exact details I can think the best is I'll put you on a call with the UK met the vast UK met office team the people who did the RFP and you can understand all the performance positioning we did there and the use case of the customer and the portfolio of performance the customer is looking to get.

[00:15:30.91]  Jason ValleryI mean, to be fair, they've been a Blob customer for a long time, from one of the largest Blob customers, and they've been running their supercomputer in Azure for a while, so this is a new generation of supercomputer being built for them, but the really is rooted in they're planning to modernize away from they had like this was public reporting there was a big announcement Microsoft made maybe two years ago they Microsoft built a Cray supercomputer and put it in that and that's what they've been on for a while and now one of the parts of that deal was they were going to modernize away from Cray and go to GPUs and you know refactor the entire or weather forecasting stack. So what I'm unclear on is what they've done there

[00:16:12.02]   RemoteAnd what that means for the I/O characteristics

[00:16:13.78]  Jason ValleryAnd how it's changed.

[00:16:14.88]   Remote- So what the team said is that the 10-year contract that created in it was five years for the first solution, and then after five years, Microsoft needs to replace it with a second solution. Today was the first solution. production in the past few months and it took a year to set it up and it's in production now and now all the conversation with Vaas is to buy Vaas and start the deployment in a year and a half so it will be ready to be the secondary solution so it seems that they've moved everything I don't know what the meaning of everything is that they've moved data from Azure Blob into Cray and they're expected to be ready in a year and a half so I think this is extremely unhappy with Cray and with Lustre, right? So that's where Bust came into play. Bust started this campaign with UKMH maybe three years ago, maybe two years before I joined, right? So there was another sales guy that died on the beach, meaning that he ran the opportunity and couldn't close it and he is not at Bust anymore, and now the new guy joined about eight months ago. We are now at money time. they've made a selection post RFI. The selection is us, and now they're pushing internally, externally, to figure out how do they move forward. Internally with EGLE, externally with us. But again, Jason, if you want to get more technical details, I can put you on a call with the right people. The UK Met Monday call that we have every week to sync up with your team has moved from Wednesday and I will invite you for that call moving forward so but it's not today it's on Wednesday and what they're waiting for right now by the way for us is to know when can they get access to something that they can test with. Spoke with Chacha yesterday and he said you can tell them December 1st week so that's the week. Beyonce, it's in sync with you right? December 1st for Azure. yeah i mean of course uh eagerly anticipating getting uh a deployment on on on azure to begin with you know so hopefully we will be able to meet those states and with uh acceptable performance and uh you know yeah and shaka asks me not to ask you can get one yesterday you could get one a month ago on Azure okay we have not been able to deploy on you did not ask anyone and you did you not show the issue so we can resolve it and I told Icky many times You want a deployment? You can have a deployment. I'm getting it from Eiki. You know, he hasn't been able to deploy. You guys are not following through. You need to, if you have a problem, the Slack group tells what the problem is and we can solve it. Without seeing the problem, we can't help you. We are deploying. it from yesterday we deploy multiple but we've deployed before so I need to see we need to see the exact problem. So Roner, you had a question about asking Microsoft more questions to support your teamwork yeah I said yeah I also spoke with Shachar because he mentioned that he's meeting So he met with IGAL yesterday, that's what I said, he has lunch and dinner with him today and I sent him these questions and he also raised them. Okay, so if you share the question with me, I can get to the people in IGAL's group to start a thread of emails. IGAL is a CBP responsible for 2000 people. I sent you an email. Ah okay, so you did. Let me see. Yes, you did. Okay, so I'll follow up on it in parallel, and I'm also going to be at that dinner, but I will follow up in parallel with the right people. So, you know, if Igor wants to accelerate, he can accelerate, but again, we have a good support from the Microsoft team. We'll just ask the right channels, we should get the answers. I'll be on it now. Okay, so that's Microsoft. Now, since we have an early morning for JSON calls, then I want to throw another one in the air for visibility. So I looked at, and again, we're going to have joins this call tomorrow. So this is prep for tomorrow, but I looked at GCP and, Kind of we're going to GA. So since we were going to GA for so much time again I'll push for customers who is really waiting. So there is one customer who is waiting to start the POC It's a UK customer and there are many active opportunities and conversations, but just one is looking to start the POC on AWS as you guys know and We have NBCU now that is looking to start the POC effective immediately. We had another POC which is important to understand with New York Stock Exchange, a project at New York Stock Exchange which is named ICE and that was a successful POC meaning we demonstrated vast on cloud based on world today on AWS but it ended up with the customer saying that we're not mature enough for a cloud solution, and the customer is moving forward with us on-prem, but he would want to revisit our cloud solution when we have something more mature. So it's good and bad at the same time, because at the beginning, without having AWS, we could not have competed. So now we showed him that we are on our path, but not good enough for him. So we talked about Microsoft, what's coming. and the surprise is not really a surprise, OCI. So there is one project with OCI, which is Zoom, and again, I'm not asking for anything. I'm just bringing it out there. Zoom are building the next AI step up for training on OCI. They've signed an OCI contract. They have their own cages on OCI. So it's like their own dedicated. the environment on OCI with their own servers and their own, you know, if they decide to build with us their own E5 boxes, and I had a call with the team on Thursday and I told them that for us to prioritize this project and Zoom is an on-prem customer of us and it's an on-prem customer of Weka. So it's either we take the deal or Weka takes the deal. have an advantage because they've been working on clouds for years and they have OCI customers as well. So I'm not saying we want to prioritize OCI now just just said first thing first with Zoom. I told them about our pricing and I told them about which VMs they will need to build a solution with us which are the E5 dense VMs and I said please check it out if you're looking for a petabyte and you're comparing on the same VMs as to other players, meaning Weka will run on the same VMs, then the price is the same price, give or take. Then it's really a decision that we want to run the PLC or do we want to compete. If you're comparing us to a solution like Weka that is 10% on NVMe and 90% on object storage, then we can't win. Like price will never make any sense. to even ask for priority if we can't win on the TCO so I'm expecting an answer from them on that front to understand if we're being compared to apples or to oranges and then it's the comparison is is the right comparison it will be another decision point if we want to also get to the same polarity state with OCI or if we decide to skip this project. Again, it wasn't promoting it, it was the customer pushing for it. Nothing was promoted. So Jason, two years ago, two and a half years ago, Vaas started promoting Vaas on cloud. Campaigns, going to events, talking on stage. Before I joined the company, right? Way before, and Ronny knows when it started because he was there on day one, and I think for a certain amount of time, the Salesforce pushing for it as well and a lot of opportunities we came up like jump trading and citadels and others but there was no product and there was no delivery and Roni or engineering never put priority behind it because there was always something with higher priority so now we have changed the game and it seems that not saying that we're soon to have a reproduction quality product v1 mvp as we're calling it it. But I did not go to the sales force every two weeks and shouted to them, come to cloud, come to cloud. I wanted it to, I didn't want to shout wolf, wolf again, when there was no wolf coming. So I waited and waited. So that's why the pipeline does exist, tens of opportunities, but there was no motion of aggressive sales force running after. of those opportunities and making it an agenda. I would love to get you and Yonsi to say it's time. It's really time to be aggressive because we're delivering. So right now we're just delivering on the customers that just couldn't wait and pushed us into doing something more than us pushing customers, okay? I mean, hopefully we will be launching Google very, very soon, you know, and the things are looking now really well on Google with the performance bottleneck gone. So, I mean, there is a very large opportunity with Two Sigma. both on-prem and Google. I'm flying, I have a meeting with them November 12th and they want to want to start, you know, even a paid POC in Google. - Yeah, so I...

[00:25:53.17]  Jason ValleryPerspective though, how important is it to be able to spin the cluster up and down? That seems like that's the quality gate for me, that we would want that capability before anyone would want to take it to production just so they have a DR plan and the ability to shut down and come back. Has that been a requirement that you've heard?

[00:26:09.36]   RemoteAbsolutely. I mean, one of the things that Rony, keep me honest here, it's in 5.6 that we start supporting object, right? So, I mean, 5.6 what? 5.6 to start supporting object storage, native object storage offloading, or backing up. This is something that's still being discussed with... We'd We'd run in there's still no I'm not talking about the presistency. I'm talking about being able to back up for dr. Purpose is to object 56 I just want I want to mention that a year advanced, the roadmap doesn't mean that there is a design behind it. Anything at 5.4 clearly we're doing, at 5.5 probably we're designed already to do it. 5.6 is just a concept, right? So in the concept and in the road that we share with customers, and I've been telling the same stories, the two big things is we're going to come out with a full-blown SaaS service. going to come out with the ability to use object storage, either as archive or just use it as a field storage. So that's the roadmap, but without the plan. I think that for 5.42, and I'm saying it all the time, for where we're coming to production right now, nine out of 10 is going to be burst into cloud and customers will expect to be able to get it. Most basically, on-demand start a cluster, move data with global namespace, do what they wanna do and shut it down. That's the basic, and then the question is, because it came out with ICE and it came with others, some of them will also say, other than just bursting, if they want to hibernate, meaning shut it down but keep the data, how can they move the data into... object storage on cloud, and then if they want to start it again, they can just take the data again from object storage or find a way not to delete the data when they go into hibernate mode. That's what I heard to date because it, again, it might be that the real behavior will be for these customers, just starting an eight node cluster and deciding to keep it running forever and not hibernate. I don't want to get for the customers, but that's what people are asking for. >> So, Lior, regarding the- >> Sorry, Jason.

[00:28:41.66]  Jason Vallery>> I was just gonna say, Lior's original question was, when can we start marketing this?

[00:28:46.06]   RemoteWhen can we go to the field and say, ready?

[00:28:49.02]  Jason ValleryAnd I ask that question about offload just purely because I think what we have to do what RGA criteria, what are the set of capabilities we need to make it generally available? And this seems like one of them. I think there are probably more,

[00:29:00.45]   RemoteBut I don't know what I don't know yet.

[00:29:02.45]  Jason ValleryAnd that's really when we would go to the field.

[00:29:04.81]   Remote- So, one comment, and Ronnie, I think that what Yonsi has defined as MVP is good enough to go to the fields, and the right way to do it. in my mind is that we have two or three projects that are going to be the leading projects, friendly vast customers that are aware of the fact that it's incomplete and then we work with them on stuff that will work and will not work and we'll figure out with them how to move it to completeness and I'm not saying it needs to take months right but I'm just I can't believe it that you know we will ever have something that is going to be perfect for v1 the forum for me mvp is perfect for v1 and then let's just get customers to move to see as an example i had similar conversation with jump trading we want 10 petabytes 20 petabytes let's start the poc tomorrow and they never did they never started the poc they started looking at numbers and prices and they just never did, and it's the same with Citadel. I said there at meetings at Citadel, we want 10 petabytes on cloud, and I, you know, every week with Ronnie, Ronnie Citadel is waiting for the software. When we were ready for, for testing, nobody started the PLC. So I think we need to have three real projects on GCP, three real projects on Azure, three real projects on AWS, move with them into production because we will understand what production means. The world gets it. We will just know. Lior, we had we have a design for supporting Hibernate and Resume for clusters initially for single node but can be enlarged for a cluster but it will sidelined by Yogev, because it's not prioritized. So, if you think otherwise, you should speak to Yogev. He mentioned that since we're gonna do the EBS and the scripting, this is not prioritized, this is not important. That's it. I don't know if it's a priority. I'm assuming based on the projects I've seen, so that JSON, that's your decision product, right? So, you know, the question is, I can put you in front of the projects that are moving into a POC, and the question is, once the data moves into cloud and the work has been done and they want to shut it down, what do they want to do with the data which is on cloud? If they want to move this delta of changes back on-prem, then there is no need to hibernate into object storage on cloud. If they expect to have a pool of data on cloud that they can move the data to cloud object storage and then move data in and in when in and out when needed, then we do need to be able to hibernate, and the design, the new design only, isn't going to be at least ready for a year. So, you know, I think that's why I thought it would work because the hibernation... Hibernate is a much smaller feature in a few weeks. So that's why I thought it might be worth prioritizing, but it needs to come from you.

[00:32:06.40]  Jason ValleryI think the question is, does Hibernate get us any further down the journey of the eventual goal of having full offload, where you can have the working set, span, NVMe, and--

[00:32:16.78]   RemoteObject no no no it doesn't so it's just the copy of the data it's just a copy but it's it's not rip it's not continuous copy so when you want to hibernate we copy the data and then when you bring it up we copy it I don't know priority one it's a good question to ask the initial projects if it's if it's really a complete solution that they would see valuable or not maybe that means nothing that you can move it aside and and of course that severely is impacted by the size of the cluster I mean we can't we can't defeat the loss of gravity or physics, I mean if somebody wants to hibernate a 4 petabyte cluster, there is going to be a wait time when you are backing it up or copying it to objects. Well, you're right to an extent because we do it there, it's not something... that's done per cluster, it's done per node, per VM. So as long as we can parallelize enough, we can do it fast, at the same speed, we do know that there is a limit in GCP and AWS in how many concurrent requests you can do to objects, but there are ways to work around it. in gcp you can use multiple buckets but yeah you're right it's uh the bigger you are the harder it is okay so i i would say again i want jason go to sleep i would say that uh we want to ask if maybe it's too late because of coffee. We want to ask the active project that are talking about being the first to move forward or any active project about hibernate the way it works today and the value it can bring or doesn't bring before we make it a priority. So I just don't know. You know the, you know, we can ask the ice team the New York Stock Exchange team because they had a lot of collaboration with the customer around data moving in and out. which they demonstrated SyncEngine, but the question is what was exactly the story there? Was it partial data? Was it a big, you know, pool of data on object storage that they wanted to move data in and out? So it's not a backup anymore. It's more data collaboration and data movement. There is a difference between hibernating into an image than to just moving data and having a namespace or a catalog that's overseas. is the data. Let's, so there is no requirement on it right now. Thank you for showing that there is an option to get there, but at least for me, there is no requirement. Okay, and Jason, if I can ask for kind of an action item, like we need to form a product roadmap that doesn't put even us internally in complete. going to kind of all over the map. This discussion we had earlier about five, six, right? And I want to know that if I communicate something to the field, it's really in sync and consistent with what you're doing and Renan is doing and Jeff, meaning are we communicating to the field that SAS is coming? And if we're not, if we are, like what's the priority, Is it going to come first? If we're doing it, are we communicating a design that will include object storage and different price points? These are big questions because it's coming up at every conversation, and it's about building trust with our sales force and then with customers. I think our sales force do not trust. If you ask Tomer, and again, he will say, don't quote me, he said good that you started, I can walk away. I wasted so much time. This is our product. So much time and there is nothing to sell. So, you know, this is a big task of changing momentum and making something real. So it's important to have a road map that we can stand behind. Non-NDA road map and NDA road map.

[00:36:23.14]  Jason ValleryAnd form convictive opinions about a lot of these things. But at a higher level, what I do worry about is that the cloud approach I'm seeing is pretty much just lifting and shifting the on-prem product and pushing it into the cloud, and that's gonna come with a lot of, there's so many different pain points with that. So we have to figure out how we deeply integrate the cloud.

[00:36:43.10]   Remote- I mean, we are desperately not to. I mean, that has been, yes, the POCs, but I mean, what we are building in Polaris is to make it fully managed. So the entire life cycle management and everything is done and it's way more simple. It has to be way more simpler than, than, than, than, I mean, we, we don't have the luxury of sending or. or having SEs, you know, work on instantiating the cluster and then, you know, SSHing into it and fixing it on the fly. That's never going to work in cloud, ever, and that's why we have Polaris there. You're talking about the management platform above the product. and Jason is right, the product is just lift and shift to the cloud. All the base functionalities are lift and shift, you're making it easier to consume with Polaris and solving maybe problems that related to its deployment, but the basic operation It's the same as on-prem, I mean, just we didn't do a lot to make it adaptable. But the basic operations is the same for all of our competitors on-prem and in the cloud. It's the same product, of course. I mean, that's what people expect. They don't expect limited, you know, if you're talking about the design review, course going to take a lengthier time we're not going to be waiting 12 to 18 months you get something up and running because we're changing the design of the actual product. No I need to sell I need to do commission so we all agree what we have today is lift and shift on the data level and the new design will make it a cloud product and the new design will be ready in a year and a half So we need to work with what we have today, and we need to see that the new design is going to be much better. It's much more compatible with the cloud. Now, in some places, we have a backdoor. A backdoor maybe with Microsoft specialized to put our own hardware there, as an example. Or maybe now with the new LSV5 that is coming out, maybe Eagle will enable us to use those as built-in. metals you know in cages where we can use it as persistent NVMe storage and not the thermal NVMe storage and it would be more like it's lift and shift that we will get at least the same lift and shift who knows behavior so we need to work with what we have for the next 18 months while we change the design I would say but you know so we're on the same page here but I'm talking about do we communicate to our sales force? I didn't take front stage and make noise over the go-to market calls every two weeks. I didn't. I just answered questions, and I did my best not to oversell anything. We have time between now and the SCO in February, because I think that between now and February, it's going to be 10. active design projects that will make us understand what general availability is, and then the entire sales force is going to come ready for training and ready for to understand, you know, the priority. We need to be ready for that with the right pricing, the right approach, the right user stories, the right integration, the right solution, everything, and also the right roadmap to say you're selling. A and B will come and that's when it's going to come and that's what you need to sell it. So it sounds like it's a lot of time from now but beginning of February is what, two and a half months? Three months? Nothing. With the holidays in between? We need to be ready for that. That's my two cents. Okay so I've sent you the invite JSON for the next UK Met Office call, and then I will ask James to add you to the sequence, and I took an action item of connecting you to two people, the Microsoft guy that can help us understand how do we do the comparison against Azure Blob. Sorry, I managed Luster. So we can understand the design differences and performance differences. It's a good exercise and he's a nice guy, and the other one is action item of putting you a person who did our design for UK match performance based on their use case. If you wanna get more details on what exactly have we specced for, okay?

[00:41:08.17]  Jason Vallery- Okay, sounds good.

[00:41:08.76]   Remote- Anything else, anyone? No? And Jason, thank you for joining early time. We'll have a recap tomorrow or we do it again. tomorrow with more people on the call with marketing and other people on the call. Yeah, makes sense, and at the Jones' call. Okay. There is a call later today on the new pricing model. Are you guys doing that? Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Pricing. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:41:34.03]  Jason ValleryYeah.

[00:41:34.65]   RemoteOkay. Talk to you guys in a second. Okay. I'll end it here for now, thank you.
