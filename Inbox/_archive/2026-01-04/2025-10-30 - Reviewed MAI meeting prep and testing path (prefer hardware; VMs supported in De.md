# 1:1 — Lior — 2025-10-30

> [!info] Purpose
> Build trust, surface and remove blockers, align on priorities, coach & grow.

## Summary

Reviewed MAI meeting prep and testing path (prefer hardware; VMs supported in Dec, small). Agreed to avoid sharing non-public Azure BLOB data externally. Plan to add observability and CSI driver slides to deck. Discussed engaging Azure hardware CVP (Ronnie Borker) via a sponsor (e.g., Nidhi) vs Israeli backchannel. Aligned on two-track cloud strategy: marketplace SaaS maturity and hardware-optimized first‑party wins (Azure primary, OCI secondary), with AWS deprioritized near term. Lior to follow up with Igal on VM roadmap politics. Jason to align with Jeff on priorities, team, and whether to bring Karl onto his team.

## Key facts learned

- MAI contact asked to start testing immediately; prefers functional access now.
- Current support: pre-certified hardware only; no VMs until December (small VMs).
- LSV4 is poor; future VMs look strong but are a year out and uncertain vs competitors.
- Avoid exposing non-public Azure BLOB HDD/Flash data to third parties (N-scale).
- Deck needs side-by-side design comparison plus observability and CSI driver callouts.
- Azure hardware path likely via CVP Ronnie Borker, sponsored by another CVP (e.g., Nidhi).
- Microsoft org: storage, compute, networking have competing incentives; politics sensitive.
- Foundry/OCI leads asked for Azure/OCI access to VAST; marketplace presence matters.
- Strategy: parallel tracks—marketplace SaaS maturity + ODM/reference hardware for first‑party wins.
- AWS deprioritized for now (SC focus on GCP/Azure); OCI is strategic secondary.
- OpenAI is the top win; right of first refusal reportedly lifted, enabling multi-cloud data plane.
- Jason travel heavy until mid-December; meeting Jeff in SF next week for guidance.

## Outcomes

- Plan for tomorrow’s MAI call: 10-minute design review, then clarify testing scope/KPIs/timeline and hardware logistics.
- Deck to include portal observability screenshots and CSI driver callout.
- Comparison table to avoid non-public Azure figures in externally shared material.
- Lior to follow up with Igal to acknowledge updated VM roadmap and manage politics.
- Potential path to Azure hardware engagement identified (via Nidhi to Ronnie Borker).
- Lior to schedule meetings with MAI at KubeCon/Ignite/SC as applicable.
- Lior to try scheduling a GCP program review with Billy (depending on Jason’s availability).
- Jason to consult Jeff on scope, priorities, team structure, and Karl resourcing.

## Decisions

- Do not include non-public Azure BLOB performance data in externally shared decks.
- Emphasize observability (single pane of glass) and CSI driver in the MAI deck.
- Pursue parallel strategy: marketplace SaaS maturity and first‑party hardware‑optimized wins.
- Near-term focus: Azure first-party opportunities (MAI, UK Met); OCI as secondary; AWS deprioritized for SC.

- [x] Plan Azure/GCP marketplace timelines and minimal viable offerings to satisfy stakeholders (e.g., Foundry, Kanchan). @Jason Vallery 🔼 ✅ 2025-11-08

## Risks

- Microsoft internal politics (compute vs storage vs networking) may slow or derail paths.
- Leaking non-public Microsoft data could damage trust and access.
- Dependence on hardware shipment for early testing; VMs unsuitable until December.
- Lack of marketplace presence reduces credibility with some Azure stakeholders.
- Unclear engagement model for Azure hardware CVP without a sponsoring executive.
- Resource constraints and Jason’s travel load may limit execution speed.
- GCP first-party strength may limit first-party win potential vs Azure/OCI.

## Open questions

- Should we approach Ronnie Borker directly via Israeli team or wait for Nidhi/Anand to sponsor the intro?
- Can MAI host hardware for immediate testing, and what exactly do they want to validate (KPIs, timeline)?
- What is Jason’s defined scope, team, and capacity for cloud productization and first-party pursuits?
- Will Karl join Jason’s team, and what responsibilities will he own?
- Will Jason attend re:Invent, or remain focused on Azure/GCP/OCI priorities?
- What are realistic timelines for Azure and GCP marketplace availability?
- Is pursuing GCP first-party TPU pathways viable, and who will sponsor that within Google?

> Next meeting (if any): 2025-10-31

[00:00:00.04]  Jason ValleryHello, sir, how are you?

[00:00:02.00]   RemoteAll is good.

[00:00:04.25]  Jason ValleryAll is good, huh? I saw an email from you a minute ago. I haven't looked at the deck yet. It sounds like you made some progress.

[00:00:12.39]   RemoteIt's simple. I was just waiting so I was on other emails. So, we have the two designs. I made some minor modifications. the designs they shared. I had some slides before and after to make it a complete deck. I still want to put side-by-side comparison table on those two options. I think that if it's public numbers what you shared about Azure Blob, no reason not to put side-by-side-by-side.

[00:00:42.40]  Jason ValleryYeah, well, and I think, you know, I think There's the LSV-4, LSV-5, and then we could put BLOB on HDD and BLOB on Flash as comparison points. My only apprehension about BLOB on HDD and BLOB on Flash is that arguably that's not public information that Microsoft exposes, it's just information that happens to be in my head. get exposed to customers you know in like an NDA one-off way. It's not something that like nobody knows but you won't go find it on Microsoft's website is my key point there, and so you know I'm fine with sitting down in a meeting with Kanchan or Nidhi or whatever talking about it and they know I obviously know that. But I wouldn't want it to go to N-scale, because then we're sort of leaking Microsoft information to a third party, and that's where I think we have to be careful.

[00:01:40.02]   RemoteSo let's think about it again. Since the last time we spoke about it, she already reached out and said, "When can I start testing?"

[00:01:48.05]  Jason ValleryYeah.

[00:01:49.13]   RemoteI think in her mind, you know, she… enough about us from Kovid, right? She wants to put a lens on it. So my reply to her, she wanted to start testing before the meeting tomorrow. So I replied and said, "I need to understand what you're expecting to get out of testing. If it's just functional testing, we'll get you access to a system in front of our NeoClouds, right? Because it's already up and running. If you want to test then no, you just can't install it on any hardware. We have pre-certified hardware that, you know, we work with. - Yeah. - And we don't support VMs today yet, right? Eagle's VM, we're going to only support in December, and even when we do support, it's not something to run and talk about because it's very small VMs. But then the question to air tomorrow is, can you accommodate hardware? If you can, we can ship you hardware immediately, right? So we can be very quick in shipping a kit to the right type of customers. So I think she's already past the point of comparing us to Microsoft offering. She just wants to touch it. She wants to understand what it is. So maybe, you know, for your other meetings, and I saw your email, You should have the side-by-side-by-side, and I'm happy to support you with what I know about, you know, all the VMs that are coming out, but probably not for this meeting, and touching that, I will compliment another point that I want you to be sensitive about and also get your advice. So Eagle called me yesterday freaking out, and Eagle never called me before. It was hard to get him to set a meeting or to reply to emails, and now he's calling my phone. I said, "Igal, what's the story?" He said, "Manish reached out to him internally, and said that Renen spoke with Manish, and Renen told him that the VMs that he's getting from compute are not good, and that's just the blocker to why we don't work with him." So Eagle is saying, "I'm doing my very best to sponsor you for Ignite, at Ignite, building your VMs, and you're pooing on my work." So I told Eagle, "Look, Eagle, let's be honest. Six weeks ago, eight weeks ago, we visited Redmond. We shared the exact status, LSV4 is the worst VM we have in the market. We shared it with you. We shared it with them." Since then, you've communicated. which between us, what he communicated is probably the best VMs. Again, I'm not saying it's the best solution because at the end, the question is availability, reliability, ease of use, pricing. But again, if you just look at the VM spec, what Eagle communicated for 2026 is the best VMs in the market. Simple, and the miscommunication was fair.

[00:04:33.66]  Jason Vallery- Yeah, but the timeline is a year out, so it's irrelevant. I mean, Amazon and Google could ship something sooner than.

[00:04:39.69]   Remote- It's a year out, Google Z4, again, you're not, I will put you in front of the Z4 product manager, but based on what Eagle shows for next year, google z4 like he's talking about google z4 talking about end of next year to be at 400 gig and 120 terabytes right he's talking about 800 gig 300 terabytes end of year so again i want to respect the fact that he has moved from being the last with what he has today to being the front runner Amazon does have 300-gig VMs, but that's not AMD or Intel, it's their own chip. So that's a decision for us if we want to run on ARM or not. It's another product decision because we can say, "Yes, we can do that," but we can call those boxes D-Boxes because, you know, we're doing D-Boxes today with Bluefield, which is also ARM. But if you put that aside, if you look at Intel AMD, Amazon are at 200 gig right now and 120 terabytes, and we didn't get any visibility to something that is going to come anytime soon, which is better. So legitimately, Eagle did the right thing. But what I told Eagle, "Look, Eagle, what we shared six weeks ago was honest, and we shared it with you. if Manish decides to pick on you on that. That's internal politics, and then he also asked to be on the monthly call with Manish and Ong, and I told him if you want to be on the monthly call that Manish and Ong are organizing, ask Manish and Ong to be invited. Don't put me there, like I'm not supposed to be dealing with your politics, and the last piece, and it's also on the email thread with Chi, the call tomorrow. I also told him, "Look, Egal, I really love the fact that you're bullish about working with us, and at the end of the day, most customers, once we have something working on the marketplace, will run on your hardware. There is no way around it, right? But we don't have the same objectives." I told him, "Just let's be clear. If UK-MET are looking to start testing in two weeks and they can't use your hardware, of VMs because they're not good enough, we should support them with other hardware, and if MAI asks for other hardware, we will support them with other hardware. Like, we can't slow down because we want to be nice to you. So I'm not going to surprise you. That was my communication with him. Like, if I know that we're going against your hardware, I will let you know. You won't learn about it from Anish or from Chi. like I will if you're supporting us we'll support you but you can't be blocking us and you can't expect us to block ourselves because of you I'm sharing all that because

[00:07:15.55]  Jason ValleryYou came from Microsoft so you understand the politics so well I mean that is the thing about Microsoft but it is just all each each P&L owner is out to get another is get get everybody else like I don't know if you've ever seen it but there's this classic diagram that shows the organizational politics of Amazon versus Google versus Microsoft versus, you know, and how the hierarchies play together, and if you look at the Microsoft diagram, and I'll find it for you as a follow up, I guess every business unit, the gun pointed at each other, and so what I, what's happening is, you know, obviously. EGOL sees the opportunity to be the data storage layer for AI. Like that's probably why he's giving you so much attention. You know, the the politics and like everybody hates Azure Storage, so let's just be clear that like EGOL is not a fan of Azure Storage because Manish has just been causing him a decade of a of compute availability issues 'cause the block storage offerings at Microsoft are garbage. Needy doesn't like Azure Storage because there's no engagement there on the frontier on AI, product is super far behind. Needy doesn't like Azure Storage. Basically, honestly, Azure Storage is like the red-headed step. child of AFT. The networking team doesn't even like AFT, because they abused the network, they abused the hell out of the network, and so you know they're all they're all playing their little victims and you know they're all trying to figure out how they they win their piece of the pie, and so I see you know EGOL I'm sure is looking at it from that lens. But you know I don't see him coming to the table with the kind of solution we're pitching to UK Met or the kind of solution we'll pitch to MAI, if he wants to show up and give us an instance type that looks like the Dbox-Eboxes that we have in that diagram, great, we'll work with EGOL. What's going to show up? And I know Manish isn't going to show up with that. I'll tell you, there's a guy in Manish's team, actually in Ong's team, who I have a ton of for and he owns Azure Storage Hardware and Roadmap, and like, I'm so tempted to just reach out and say hi to him and kind of walk him through like those two slides because I think his eyes would, you know, the hardware qualification process at Microsoft for storage is a five-year thing, and, you know, just now they're qualifying. 16 terabyte flat. Like so far behind. It's his team responsible for it. So you know what I would push back and say is either his team takes on a serious project to go and qualify real storage hardware for real storage scenarios, or we have to go work with, I told you about Ronnie Borker, she her team runs all. the hardware platform, and so Myra, the guy I'm talking about, Michael Myra, partners with Ronny's team, but they're the ultimately the ones that would go build an Azure qualified solution that looks like the one in those diagrams. I don't think it's eagles. Ronny doesn't report up to Anandi. She's not a part of Specialized. She's still mainstream Azure. She's her own work. She's the hardware work end to end. So like. like storage partners with her, compute partners with her, networking partners with her. She owns the data center hardware.

[00:10:38.04]   Remote- I see, okay.

[00:10:41.42]  Jason Vallery- You want to think things about, I don't know if I've ever shared this with you, you know, on the compute side, you know, Azure has a dozen different instance types, the F-series, whatever, there's a general purpose compute platform, and the racks that go into the data center support all of those SKUs. So it's one hardware type that gets artificially limited based on what those previous historical SKU versions were. So you could have a DV2, an FV3. and they're all running on the exact same hardware in the data center, they're just being artificially throttled to the characteristics that are promised based on that Azure compute unit metric, so that you can continue the pricing models of the past on the capacity of the future, and then they'd have one general purpose compute SKU that they iterate on, and then it publishes as a statement of which of the historical VM types can run on.

[00:11:42.96]   RemoteOkay, I guess at a certain scale, you need to do awkward stuff to keep it consistent.

[00:11:49.03]  Jason ValleryYeah, so you like, for example, the D-series and the F-series are the classic funny one because like the compute cores to the memory are a ratio and the F-series is "computed". you'd optimize in the D-series as general, and if you run an F-series VM, all they do is hide half of the memory.

[00:12:07.73]   Remote- Okay, interesting. Okay, so it sounds like we need to talk with the hardware team that you're all good. You're going to talk with them tomorrow, right? You have a call if I remember the notes on the email

[00:12:19.57]  Jason Valleryor reaching out? - So I don't... I don't have relationships in that part of the hardware team. So what I actually was proposing is that Needy would hopefully evangelize a call with Ronnie, who's the CVP for that org. I may choose, and this is where it gets a little dicey politically, to go and meet with Michael Myra, who I'm good friends with, but he reports to Ong, and I don't want to like rock the boat with Ong, I don't know, like if Myra would go back and say, "Yeah, Avast is doing this thing." But Myra is the one that'll be qualifying the upcoming storage flash SKUs. So the new hardware will be-

[00:12:54.64]   Remote- The other option is ULC. So another option is, we have a special card, which is awkward, but the special card is Israel, and the Israeli team has very strong connections. So they put us in front of a lot of people. If you ask for a specific meeting with someone, if I ask, not you, it's not going to reflect on you. So send the contact information. I can try and get a meeting with that lady at Ignite, if she's going to Ignite, and I can try and get a meeting outside of Ignite. Doesn't matter. So I can ask the Israeli team and saying, "We want to talk with her." That's the objective why. It's not going to direct back to you. when we get the meeting, it's your meeting.

[00:13:32.10]  Jason Vallery- Oh, yeah.

[00:13:32.99]   Remote- It's a parallel opportunity.

[00:13:34.47]  Jason Vallery- I mean, that would be, I mean, her name is Ronnie Borker. I'll send you her LinkedIn. She's the all-up CPP that owns Azure. Like her team is the one that would, if we were going to go ODM and take, you know, an HPE type SKU or something like that, her team would be the one that would Azure-fy it in quotes. it to be something that the capacity management teams can actually go deploy into any Azure data center.

[00:13:59.77]   RemoteSo she would go into any Azure data center where specialized is only for specific projects that are tailored for that hardware.

[00:14:10.83]  Jason ValleryYou should think of it like this, like the specialized team the storage team, all of those teams, they own the product, they define the requirements, then they work with Ronnie's team to go make the hardware

[00:14:24.54]   RemoteProject. Okay, so if Anand asks for us, he also goes to her? Yeah, he partners with her. Okay, right now we're that close to getting Anand to ask for us. us. So, but you're still saying we want to go directly to her. She doesn't own the product. So what's the incentive to, to, to push for it? Like if she doesn't own the product, it's not a request. She doesn't own the environment. So what's the...

[00:14:51.81]  Jason ValleryThis is where I would say, like, we need, ideally we have one of the other CBPs kind of sponsoring the conversation with her, because if Niti goes through and say, "Hey Ronnie, we wanna go make a vast thing happen, but we need to qualify some hardware so we can do a GPU plus vast kind of deployment model. You know, having Nidi sponsor that meeting makes it make sense. But as people blind to Ronnie, she's like, how do you even know I exist? 'Cause I don't own product.

[00:15:16.08]   Remote- Okay, so it's either Nidi and why, let's say Nidi is one and it seems that Anand is going to go to one way or another. needs to build it. So we're going to get in front of her one way or another.

[00:15:26.52]  Jason ValleryYeah I mean he might hide it like he might hide sort of like that as a behind the scenes thing. I don't know if he would actually you know put us in front of her. Look if you say that it's not smart to

[00:15:40.82]   RemoteApproach her directly for the Israeli team not for you and to It's not smart, then let's avoid it right if you think that it can't arm like if we're trying to get the meeting. The legitimate request, you know, the CEO is that ignite the CEO is it is it is in the end of the moon, then he would love to talk and say hi. She googles and then she sees all in any that she takes a meeting right so.

[00:16:03.33]  Jason Valleryum I don't.

[00:16:04.39]   RemoteI don't see the negative here and I hear with you that if we really... out like for the CBP, then it doesn't make sense because they should reach out, not us.

[00:16:13.44]  Jason ValleryYeah, I mean, I don't, I doubt like because she doesn't own Tarek, I don't even know why she would be at Ignite. You know, this is like, so there's, there's, there's two, there's a bunch of teams, but there's two key teams here that are in play. Roni's team owns the hardware that goes in the data center, and then there's the actual data center teams called CUNI. They partner together to deliver the capacity with a third organization called CSCP, which partners with all of the logistics SIs that build on. So those three teams are the actual Azure team. Everybody else you're talking to are just the product teams that go and define the requirements, but the people that actually build and build. to deliver the infrastructure. Ronnie's team, CO&I and CSCP. There's a guy named Cliff Henson that runs CSCP and Paul Clark who runs CNLI. Those three CVPs, their orgs are the one that actually are responsible for building it, if that makes sense.

[00:17:06.75]   Remote- Okay. So I'm going to follow up with Egal, just FYI, I'm going to tell him thank you for the new VMs and I will put Yonsi and Renata. on the email so he can use it internally to share that you know we're happy with where he's going to but it's not going to again i'm trying to i'm going to help him a little bit with politics otherwise i'm leaving them there eye eye and dry and what else is on your agenda what else would

[00:17:32.63]  Jason ValleryYou want to discuss or well i mean i'm curious about this this cheating meeting tomorrow, and that email around getting access quickly is interesting. I'm actually pretty excited about it. I think that must mean that they're ready to move fast on how do they solve the control point problem. So I don't know like if you have any other intelligence or comments on how that's been presented to you and how... Like, we should approach the meeting. Do you have a strategy for what we're doing? Is it just showing this deck or?

[00:18:06.98]   Remote- It's simple, right? She already asked for testing. You gave me the background of what's an incentive to make it work. Previous meeting, Alon was on the meeting. Alon is our guy with CoWave. So he's the guy with inflection, and he got feedback from the inflection team that they spoke with her and her team and they gave them all the good and best feedback about VaST, but overall it was good feedback. So the meeting was about why does the inflection team likes you? That was the first meeting, and then, you know, how do you suggest we build something for 160,000 GPUs? kind of open-ended, wasn't really sharing more details than that, and for that, I like the performance and capacity kind of approach. So, what I want to do tomorrow is I want to address first kind of the best practices of how do we build to that scale, and based on the NVIDIA reference design, you know, with performance in mind or capacity in mind, and then I want to ask scared because she always asked for a system, you know, what is the sequence of Events, what are they trying to achieve? What is the timeline? What do they want to do? What do they want to prove? What's the KPI for success? If she already wanted to do testing, you know, can we ship the hardware? What will be the next step and so on and so forth. So just make it very pragmatic about moving forward like a business process and If you're on the call clearly you're on the call and you want it like there are many people on the call on our side side it's only a 30 minutes call so I want to share the designs over 10 minutes and explain the designs and see that they fully understand the concept of C and D and why we're suggesting what we're suggesting so the deck is really short and around that and then it's really you wanted to do testing tell us what do you want to test what are you trying to to get to how can we support you and just build a plan with her so it will be pragmatic. Now she is going to KubeCon, the Kubernetes event in Atlanta the week before, so Alon is there. So I will secure a meeting for her with Alon when they're there so he can make his, you know, charming personality work and his amazing, you know, talent. and technology. If she's going to Ignite, I will already put another meeting for her a week after that with Yonsi and Reneno are going to be at Ignite. She's going to supercomputing with us wherever she's going, but she wanted to test yesterday. So let's see how do we move forward.

[00:20:31.65]  Jason ValleryOne thing I didn't see in the deck was, I still, I still finally think like a screenshot. of the logging and monitoring experience, and just highlighting that single pane of glass of operations within our control plane and in our portal just will help sell this to her, and we should call that out as one of the key things that MAI benefit from is observability and management

[00:21:00.42]   RemoteOkay, I'm with you. I will get another slide there.

[00:21:06.76]  Jason ValleryScreenshots are on that.

[00:21:07.83]   RemoteI'm now checking the main deck to see what's on the main deck, as we're talking about it. But I'll find the right slides to add to it. So maybe even maybe a little bit adjust the first to talk about the bullet points we talked about earlier. So it would just be an interface.

[00:21:27.85]  Jason Vallery- And then again, the CSI driver, I think is, there needs should be, we should make some sort of call out on the CSI driver. You know, obviously that's what she cares about is, how do I simplify deployment and management of this from a Kubernetes control plane?

[00:21:42.53]   Remote- Okay. What is your activity? So aside to Azure and UKMet, I think now you're in the details, right? Of UKMet, at least a little bit in the details and very good call earlier this week, meaning they're finally moving forward and I think that the specialized hardware is the right path forward here. What do you see, when do you?

[00:22:07.96]  Jason ValleryStart engaging on the GCP front or Azure front? Well if you know what I would say is obviously there are a lot of places I could spend my time. I have nothing but travel scheduled basically between now and December. So starting next week, I'll be with... Jeff in San Francisco, and then supercomputing in Tel Aviv, in Iceland, and shit, I don't know, other trips. Tech Summit, there's other things going on. I've got an all day with Jeff, and I want his guidance on where he wants me to focus.

[00:22:50.01]   Remote- Okay, so next week, you're in the Bay Area? Okay, and the week after? The Tech Summit?

[00:22:56.00]  Jason ValleryI think that's right.

[00:22:56.96]   RemoteHold on.

[00:22:57.98]  Jason ValleryLet me pull my calendar. Literally, every week, there's something going on. So, yeah. Next week, I'm in San Francisco with Jeff. The week after, I am in Orlando for Tech Summit all week. The week after, I am... The Tech Summit is a full week? Five days? Five days? Five days. Five days. Five days. Five days. Five days. Okay.

[00:23:12.96]   RemoteSo, next week, I'm in San Francisco with Jeff. The week after, I am in Orlando for Tech Summit all week.

[00:23:15.46]  Jason ValleryI'm flying there on Monday and then I'm leaving there on Thursday evening and then the following week is supercomputing and then the following week I'm going to Tel Aviv plus Thanksgiving when I get back home. Then the following week isn't booked yet, but I feel like there was something, and then the week after that is I'm going to Iceland with Jeff, and then we're December 15th is the first time I know I'm home for a week.

[00:23:52.57]   Remote>> Okay, so the week of the 1st of December is the week of re-invent.

[00:23:59.01]  Jason Vallery>> That's what it was, I don't know if I'm going to that. I don't know. I haven't booked any travel for that, but that's another conversation for Jeff for me to have with him.

[00:24:07.48]   RemoteOkay, so the last two weeks had a huge momentum shift to Azure. Now, by the way, Renan put on ice the ability for me to hire a strategic business development person for Azure hired and said you know we have Jason we don't need anyone else yeah I'm just sharing with you that and again I don't not saying it's it's right or wrong right now I don't think we need another chief in the kitchen right another chef in the kitchen so like there is MAI there is UK Met and if we can figure those two then we have the King's Royal open to create something huge with Azure. So we don't need another person to be there, right? And you know those guys. So I would say that it wasn't there. UKMet was always in the background, but now, you know, with Timeline pressing them and them moving into kind of specialized hardware, it's going to become real, and MAI just opened up a week ago. So that's that's a big one, right? Other than that my person my kind of viewpoint on all that is GCP is is where we're going to define What's vast on cloud for the rest of the market not for the big ones? Because that's where we're doing all the cooking on marketplace offering collateral burst into cloud use case is like basic stuff. So I think your influence, again that's my viewpoint, your influence on the quality of what we're doing there will impact the tens of projects that the salesforce will go after, right, the rest of the salesforce, and whatever we do with GCP will become the blueprint of what we'll do with others. So I think you should... We should try to find some time to go into the details, because right now there isn't any, like the product is being defined on Polaris by Yonsi, and the product is being defined on the data plane by Yogev or Shahar, and I'm not saying Yonsi doesn't know cloud, but I'm just saying nobody is defining the end-to-end approach. a GCP, there wasn't a thinking process of let's build something that will be fully integrated with GKE, right? So, you know, a user wants to deploy us on GCP, and he can just go to the Kubernetes platform and click, click, and everything works. There is no cloud thinking process behind like it's again it's the lift and shift so it's small touches that can change everything and i'm suggesting on that level maybe i'll set a call tomorrow with billy billy is the technical guy who supports us on on gcp and billy i spoke with him earlier this week as the a few ideas of what's the right way to approach and business on GCP which is different programs or the different ways that they want to see people consuming storage or data on GCP that we can become a part of so customers will get full automation or ease of use for our platforms, and we need to decide where we're putting resources. So I will put something on the calendar for tomorrow. I will check first to see that your calendar is open. open and Billy will talk about it. So one of those programs is something that they, so when they announced Managed Lustre, which is DDN for them, then they've cluster store, cluster manage, it's like a full automation of how do you build an HPC environment with Managed Lustre, but with everything around it as well. So using the scheduler and using everything to just. automate stuff, and we're trying to push third parties into the same, you know, same places, the right third parties, and we're a third party for them. So, um, so I think GCP now, AWS, I'm with you. Like, re:Invent, I don't see a reason right now to be there. We have projects on AWS, but we have focus on them on business development other than this FSx program with Ed who is a friend of Yonzi and clearly that opens up then they get all priority because it's the first part with the AWS but my strategy for supercomputing was actually the opposite was to ignore them meaning I said not that they care about me but I said I don't have the time to to figure out a way to build them, and right now it's so many action items on GCP, and now we just got these huge projects moving on Microsoft and so many action items on Microsoft and I still don't have a team. So I said, okay, we'll get to supercomputing. We're going to have PRs with both other CSPs. We're going to be in their booth for presentations. They're going to be in our booth for presentations. and the AWS HPCTM is going to say, why are we not working with Rust? Why are they not working with us? So instead of having something small and big for attention, maybe it will be, you know, running away from them will get us the attention we're looking for. Maybe it doesn't, I don't know. Like I'm right now I'm guessing, right?

[00:29:13.36]  Jason Vallery- A little bit of jet sea and funnel. strategy. Yeah, I mean, I think we're aligned. I think, you know, when I look at where I can add the most value, it's going to be on some of the product maturity elements around the cloud. I mean, the calls I'm getting pulled into, I'm just shocked by the current processes in terms of how this stuff is done and the lack of thinking around the bigger picture in terms of the cloud, like the pricing model conversation. We had a call today around like, what legal looks like and support structures and none of that is really being thought through. I think that if I was really to look at where I can have the most value, it's influencing a lot of that. I want to lean in and help with the relationships I have at Microsoft and the knowledge I have around how Microsoft is built out, but I don't know that I'm the right BD support for you to really get. the traction you need. So I, you know, I want to help, but I don't know that I'm the right person to fully take that role on, and then the span- I'm not looking for BD. My comment about BD was,

[00:30:12.23]   RemoteWas more about when you talk to Jeff and when you talk to Renan, you can just say, Hey, like, I'm not a BD person. Right, and I don't have the time. Like you, you gave me so much work. I can work five days a week. week and I can work 10 days a week and I still have work. - Yeah. - And I don't have time to do the BD work. But right now I'm just saying that, you know, Renan blocked it and I'm telling you, even if I can hire someone for BD tomorrow for Microsoft, I don't think it's needed. Because MAI, like, I want to be in the details with you, with Alon, with whoever, like, let's figure it out. it out, then hiring a busy person to manage the relationship moving forward would be great, right? We can't hire someone from the outside right now that will do a better job. So I'm okay with that. If I do ask for something, it's probably to put your hands more on GCP because that's the face of our cloud offering. It's not Azure. Azure will be the second or third cloud to go. be available, and whatever we do with MAI isn't cloud. It's like behind the scenes.

[00:31:13.93]  Jason ValleryBut I mean, so one of the questions that Jeff had asked me is like, how do we get some GCP beta customers? And just to play on that lens, how do we get to a MAI scale or UK Met scale customer on GCP? Do those exist, or are those opportunities in flight?

[00:31:31.29]   RemoteSo we don't have opportunities. Okay we do and we don't. 2SIG is talking about an 80 million dollar deal on GCP, 2Sigma, right? So you can say, you know, that's maybe it's not as big as MAI but it's big. There isn't any visibility to the first party projects on GCP. We didn't get there. Like, again, the first time we go to first party project on Microsoft was last week. UK Met is a strange animal. It's not MAI, it's not the foundry. It's just a customer that is, though we didn't get there yet with GCP, but we got to a lot of sizable projects. Now I think our sales force is really scared of pushing stuff into POCs because they think that we have zero, You know, reliability, stability, focus on cloud, based on their past experience of three and a half years talking about cloud and having nothing, and that's why I'm saying, how do we get there? We build trust. How do we build trust? You put your hands on what's coming out as GA to see that it's really something that you believe is decent, and then when we educate everyone. about GA, then we build their trust to move forward and to push for customers' projects. We own a lot of – the reason why GCP was prioritized is because the customer demanded it, meaning our customers are GCP customers, all of those hedge funds. Now, I have asked GCP – and again, trying to work out the thing, there is – I'm There is that guy Nirav, who is friends with Mary-Anne. Nirav looks like he's having a special channel with Mary-Anne of putting some PR language and so on and so forth. So I told John, I said, "Okay, if Nirav is so excited to help, can Nirav introduce us to a TPU first-party project?" If we're talking about us and TPUs, maybe Google. maybe you guys can work with us to qualify before we go to customers because you are the biggest TPU user. So it needs to be coming up down there from executives. So Renen met with TK, right? Renen, Yonsi, Nirav, they all met with TK. I wasn't in that meeting. Marianne is talking to Nirav who is... You know, open channel with DK, it needs to come from one of those guys, the big door opener. It's not going to come from the field.

[00:33:55.72]  Jason ValleryObviously I don't know the politics at Google and I don't know these players, but you know, when I take a look at it from a purely technical and engineering lens, and I spent a lot of money time in my previous role doing competitive analysis and teardown of Google, Amazon, and their first-party storage stacks. Google's the cloud provider that needs us the least. Their storage stack is so much better than Microsoft's and much better than Amazon's. the worry I have here is that we're going and putting our priority on the cloud where their first party offerings most fill the gaps that customers have, and so, you know, one of the things I think about is from an opportunity lens, Azure doesn't have anything here. So, we can win all the business instead of being in a heads up competition. with trying to win Google on Google. That's my biggest worry about prioritizing Google.

[00:34:58.41]   Remote- Google is not prioritized. So again, remember we talked about the right-hand and left-hand, there is supporting the vast sales force, vast customers, extending their solution into cloud. It doesn't matter how good first party Google is, the vast customer wants to burst a vast. GCP. Simple. That's one product. Second product is what we're doing with MAI right now. What you're saying is that what we're doing with MAI right now might not be open for us with Google, because they have a good enough offering. They don't need us there, which might be legitimate. But we're not doing that with Google right now. We're just like, again, it's two different products for me, two approaches you know we we want to we want to continue on that path of just building vast offerings so we can start expanding our customers business into cloud and they can use gcp they can use aws they can use azure on the other side of things we're trying to win the first parties and maybe the effort of winning the first party with gcp is a complete waste of time based on what you're saying, but it didn't happen to date, meaning we didn't try to win the first party and got blocked at Google. We didn't. We did with Microsoft. So if you would have asked me when you joined, where are we? I would say that Microsoft is where we have established the best relationship on all levels, and it's true. Look at the number of CVPs we communicate with and the number of people in the network. a shifter contract and business development people, we really, you know, we've met everybody over there. Like we know them, they know us. There is a lot of communication with zero product, and then Google is where we made a lot of investment in making this lift and shift product work, and AWS, we made a little bit of that and a little bit of that, and OCI, we did a lot of executive relationship as well. OCI is probably what we can do more damage than other places because OCI have built their own managed luster. It's new and the guy that designed managed luster is out of the building. He was let go and there is a new VP of storage that is in control. OpenAI are winning the same projects we're winning so they have a lot of first party type of deployment. They have Meta, they have NVIDIA, they have Bidense, they have XAI, they have all of the big projects, all of the model builders, OpenAI clearly are using them. So they have the same problem as what we're trying to solve for MAI, of building a lot of new data centers that needs to be efficient data centers. So strategically, Oracle is is the second one after Azure, and the third one, you can choose if it's AWS or GCP. But again, if somebody will tell me tomorrow, Leo, drop the day-to-day job. Just focus on strategic OCI. We don't care if Zoom wants to deploy a petabyte on OCI. Nobody cares. Let's just tell them, no, we're not doing it, and that will be like marching orders. So you're the VP of product management for cloud, right? If you guys decide that we're dropping the product for the 1000 vast customers, because we're focusing on 20 customers, which are not even vast customers today, some of them, then let's do it. But then it's not the product that we have to date, right? So all of your answers work with respect. All of this, you know, all of the new Polaris work and you don't need Polaris to sell C&D to MAI.

[00:38:25.12]  Jason ValleryYou don't. Right. Exactly. I mean, it's all, it's all good work. Like it's all, it's, you know, there's plenty that we can go tackle and all of it has paths to new business. So it's about prioritizing, and I guess my, my comment around Google was primarily what you're talking about. is expansion of existing logos, and what I see at Microsoft is net new wins, and net new wins at, you know, pretty extreme scale versus burst to cloud scenarios.

[00:38:49.54]   RemoteI'm with you, I'm with you. So if you and Jeff will decide next week that the product strategy doesn't include extending business with existing customers, then let's drop it.

[00:39:00.81]  Jason ValleryThe business? I think all of them are important. It's where do we spend the cycles with the limited resources and what new resources do we need to be able

[00:39:08.61]   Remoteto pursue all dimensions. Okay so we're on an agreement that strategically winning huge logos and huge business is right now at Microsoft and secondary it's at OCI. with that as well.

[00:39:24.39]  Jason Vallery- What Brandon said to me when I started was, his number one priority is getting the OpenAI load. Like that is the win that unblocks a lot for us, right? I mean, between us, it's clear like if you're going out trying to IPO a company and you're doing investor pitch decks and you can see you're the storage platform for both OpenAI and XAI, that's gonna get a lot of attention, and so, you know, the mission one. I was told is to win OpenAI.

[00:39:49.42]   Remote- Okay, so mission one is to win OpenAI. To win OpenAI, what do you need to win? You need to win Azure? You need to win OCI? What do you need to win?

[00:39:57.04]  Jason Vallery- Not OCI. I mean, what I see happening there is OpenAI is obviously moving to a world where that whole, right after the first refusal, that was present in the Microsoft contract just got lifted this week, that expands the opportunity for us to support them with a common data plane across wherever they deploy, be it Azure, CoreWeave, OCI, you name it.

[00:40:20.29]   Remote- So winning OCI, to your point, winning OCI is winning, sorry, winning OpenAI is winning OpenAI.

[00:40:29.05]  Jason Vallery- But it's-- - It's not winning But it's also like OpenAI is doing business with Google, OpenAI is doing business with Amazon, OpenAI is doing business with Microsoft.

[00:40:37.90]   RemoteI know, I know. But if the task is to win OpenAI, right, and that's the task, then for that we have a special force that is going after OpenAI, and, you know, I'm supporting them when I'm asked to, and you will hire it. to become a part of it because you know OpenAI, right? So winning OpenAI is critical, and that's the biggest one for us. We agree. But my day-to-day job is, what do we want to do with the CSPs? Like if we wait, again, there's two years of waiting pattern at VAST. We're waiting to win OpenAI. So we can, so with them we will do Microsoft, right? We're waiting to win OpenAI, with them we will do Oracle. Waiting pattern of when XAI, you know, decides to use us on OCI, then we're just going to become an OCI partner because XAI will push us into OCI. So, if this is a strategy, this is Jeff's strategy. By the way, not sure it's strategy. That's exactly what they did They said we do not want to build anything on any marketplace. If you ask Kenan about Oracle marketplace, he will say don't even say it Don't want to do anything on any marketplace He wants a first-party relationship with the CSPs to support the biggest projects on earth. That's it. That's all he cares about He does not care about Zoom bursting to one petabyte on OCI. He does not care about J.P. Morgan Chase. He does not care about any of that. He won't say it to people. He wants to win OpenAI. So I'm saying it's two different products, like OneTask, MAI, OpenAI, you know, some of them will be involved, some of them will not be involved, and then some of them would land on CSP, some of them will not land on CSP. is, you might win OpenAI and it would land in Neo clouds. Why do you care? You just won OpenAI,

[00:42:30.18]  Jason ValleryWho cares where they land, right? It's their decision. For me, and I share this, I think the opportunity with what we're describing here is by winning an MAI, a UKMAT, hopefully an OpenAI, in a world where we're using OEM hardware, more reference architecture deployments, like the NVIDIA reference architecture. If we can win that in the CSPs and deliver that solution, and then we can go do that multi-tenant, that's what we can use to unblock replicating the NetApp deal, right? Ultimately, I think the thing we're benchmarked against the coup that NetApp pulled off with Microsoft five years ago, and that NetApp in Azure data centers, and if we can go become that level in all of the CSPs, then the solution that we're presenting to our customers is of real value. But as long as we're running on LSV5 or V4 or whatever, the price to performance doesn't... allow us to be competitive at scale. It's really just never going to be that we're the system of record storage platform for a customer in Azure or at AWS or Google. So, in my mind, winning these big marquee deals is what gives us the ammunition to replicate the NetApp model.

[00:43:48.98]   RemoteOkay, so we sat down with the Foundry team last time we were there. and they heard our story and they said, "Fantastic! We would like to test. When can we get access to your software on Azure? We have nothing running on Azure." So, you want to start the conversation, that's kind of the basics. I met with the head of storage at OCI and told him about the vision at the Oracle. AI summit in Vegas and he said great I want to get access I want to start touching it I want to understand what it does when can I get access to vast on Oracle cloud it's not there right so you came from Microsoft so you probably understand the way it works like we have been trying to convince them that we are too big and too too good to just go to the marketplace That's okay to continue to try and convince now for the first time it's really happening now with MAI so maybe you know timing is everything in life. I joined a year and three months ago and it took a year and three months for Microsoft to say can we test your stuff right MAI not just Microsoft so the question is are you you know what I'm okay with any answer, but are you going to be a part of the product of that is named Boston Cloud?

[00:45:12.55]  Jason ValleryYeah.

[00:45:13.39]   RemoteWith this coding program?

[00:45:14.26]  Jason ValleryOh, for sure.

[00:45:15.00]   RemoteAnd if you are, you have to understand kind of what's the engagement model and where do we interface? Or is there, or, and I don't care if it's 80% focus is going to the strategic teams and 20% it goes to the others. Because that's where my mind is when, right? But I'm just trying to understand, you know, what is your part with Vaston Cloud, which is servicing the tens of opportunities that are right now running in, you know, in the void?

[00:45:38.62]  Jason VallerySo to be clear, I see them as parallels. Certainly do own Vaston Cloud for a product. I certainly think the marketplace is an important thing for us to check the box on. I mean, I heard that from Conchon yesterday. Conchon said to me, we can't really take that seriously if they're not in the marketplace, that's clear feedback. But the evolution has to be that there are multiple different marketplace solutions and ultimately a SaaS solution. that leverages the different hardware profiles we can do it. So, if we're putting the door, it's just delivering it on VMs, knowing we've got the control plane maturity, the pricing model, the support structure, like all of that stuff ironed out, then the hardware cost performance piece is the add-on that allows us to to expand the opportunity. So having both threads going at the same time are critical for where we will be a year from now, which is hopefully we've solved all of the support structure pieces, the execution, the control plane through the marketplace efforts that we're leading with Yonce. Simultaneously, we're adding into the options that we can deploy a hardware optimized platform. form that we're winning by the first parties unlocking the keys to the council.

[00:46:59.36]   Remote>> Okay, that's, okay, that's exactly, we're on the same page on the strategy. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I would love to understand where do you see yourself engaging on Me too. On the go-to market, on the go-to market side, meaning after you speak with Jeff and meet with Jeff, what's your involvement there? Do you want to be like, are you going to be, you know, working on engineering solutions? Are you going to be touching the roadmap? Are you going to be involved in the activities on the product side? Or are you going to stay more on the side of just echo the rest of the effort, right? Now, I'm doing both, right, on both sides, and I'm just trying to understand what's the interface with you on both sides. I understand what's the interface on MAI. It's easy. It's strategic. It's big. It's life-changing. If we get to win that, it opens up Microsoft. I understand that. Easy, and I understand also UK Met because it's a stepchild. to MBCU, two petabytes PLC starting tomorrow. Tens of open issues on the product side. Are you a part of it or not a part of it? It's also Microsoft Marketplace, deal for February, March, it's only a million dollar deal. So, and if you are a part of it, how do I engage with you and how do I use you? That's not for today, just something to think about.

[00:48:23.48]  Jason ValleryI certainly need clarity from Jeff on how he wants to allocate resources to me, like you know, that's an open question like what my team structure will be, who I'll have to be able to count on, how I can deploy them, so I don't have clarity on that, and then, you know, goals and accountability so that I know where I'm placing my time and where I add the most value. like serious conversations I need to have with Jeff before I can answer your question. I know where I want to be but I you know I need to get clear guidance

[00:48:55.47]   RemoteFrom him. Okay one last point. He asked me earlier today Jeff if you can get Carl and Carl is the technical guy, the lab guy that can do POCs and that can do designs and so on. so forth. He's not a pre-sales guy though and I need pre-sales people in my team. So I said, of course, if Jason wants to get Karl, no worries. You know, Karl can employ Jason. So I think you got a new employee in your team, and I'm okay with that, right? The guy was really good with the TPU benchmark, supporting Karatek. If you give him a very technical task and the time... It will work it will figure out how to make it work If you ask him to prepare a presentation or to present something to the customer It will tell the customer that everything doesn't work, and so again, he's not a customer facing person He's very good in behind the scenes and I know I'm at the point where I need to precess people to build architectures configure stuff promoted bullshit customers Until it will work. I need pre-sales talent in my side on go to market. I don't need people who are working in the lab So if you need him, he's all yours

[00:50:02.51]  Jason ValleryYeah, let me talk to Jeff

[00:50:06.18]   RemoteOkay, and so anyhow enjoy the week enjoy and we'll talk again tomorrow on the call with Microsoft and do you want me to set a call with Billy Google guy to understand the different programs that he's suggesting? Or is it too early for that?

[00:50:20.22]  Jason VallerySo what would be the cause?

[00:50:22.75]   RemoteThe goal is to understand from Billy, how does a solution look like on GCP, meaning right now we have designed something that works on GCP, lift and shift. Yeah, and we have designed something that works on the marketplace, even though it doesn't work yet. Not lift and shift polarity, and Billy wants to share with us the way that Google sees storage deployments on Google, meaning which other programs should we be a part of, and how do we make it easier for Google customers to consume our technology on GCP.

[00:50:53.45]  Jason ValleryAnd is there, I mean, these are so many topics I want to learn about, I mean, and honestly, like, Jeff has made it clear to me, I own all the cloud. and I shouldn't be myopically focused on Azure. So I'm not, and honestly, like where I have the biggest blind spots are gonna be Google and Amazon 'cause I don't have the background. So I am interested in learning that. You know, if we can squeeze it in tomorrow, that's great.

[00:51:16.49]   Remote- Okay, I will look at your calendar and its availability, and if it works, I'll put the meeting there.

[00:51:21.45]  Jason Vallery- Awesome. All right, bye-bye. - Touching, see you. - Bye.
