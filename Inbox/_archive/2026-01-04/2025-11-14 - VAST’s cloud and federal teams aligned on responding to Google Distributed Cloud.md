# Google Distributed Cloud RFP debrief and federal coordination
**Date:** 2025-11-14 · **Partner:** Google · **Folder:** Partners/Google

> [!summary] Executive Summary
VAST’s cloud and federal teams aligned on responding to Google Distributed Cloud’s RFP to replace NetApp for storage, with emphasis on air-gapped deployments. Google’s new GDC leader, Muninder Singh Sambi, is focused on dark-site readiness, compliance, ops posture, and quick joint validation. The group confirmed an in-flight Fort Meade initiative ("Gemini as a service" on-prem) as a near-term validation path and committed to tighter linkage between VAST Federal and Google’s federal teams. Roles were clarified: Greg will run point with Google Federal and the corporate GDC team; Jason will coordinate RFP content, intros, and ensure required technical/operations details are captured; Alon will pursue a 1:1 with Muninder to cover AI, VM shapes, and hardware tradeoffs; "Leo" owns the formal RFP response. The team will assemble evidence on certifications/ATOs, encryption, multi-tenancy, quotas, troubleshooting practices, and provide recommended Dell/HPE SKUs. An architecture review will follow to determine deployment on Dell/HPE/Cisco hardware or commodity VMs, aiming to fast-track a joint customer validation.

## Alliance Context & Key Facts
- Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) has connected and air-gapped variants; current storage partner is NetApp.
- Google issued a US-based RFP seeking a storage replacement for GDC; VAST was invited to respond.
- Google emphasis: air-gapped support, compliance/attestations, ops model (updates, staffing, troubleshooting), multi-tenancy, quotas, encryption, tags.
- Fort Meade "Gemini as a service" on-prem initiative is in Q4 commit and can serve as rapid joint validation.
- GDC hardware commonly runs on Dell; deployments have also involved HPE and Cisco gear.
- VAST recently launched Google Marketplace offers; broader partnership still early.
- Muninder Singh Sambi now oversees GDC supply chain and is prioritizing air-gapped readiness.
- VAST Federal has active relationships with Google’s DoD/IC org (Jan Niemus) and Cisco for a POC.
- Google seeks a joint customer to prove out the solution quickly.
- RFP pursuit is competitive and not guaranteed; vendor due diligence underway.

## Outcomes (Alignment, motions, artifacts)
- Designated Greg Castellucci as point of contact to drive Google Federal and corporate GDC engagement.
- Agreed that Jason Vallery will coordinate RFP content and connect Greg with Google contacts.
- Aligned that Alon Horev will schedule a 1:1 with Muninder Sambi to discuss AI approach and hardware/VM shape tradeoffs.
- "Leo" confirmed as the owner of the formal RFP response.
- Team will compile compliance, security, and air-gapped ops evidence and recommended hardware SKUs.
- Next step is an architecture review to determine deployment on Dell/HPE/Cisco or commodity VMs.
- Plan to leverage Fort Meade initiative as a near-term joint validation reference.

## Decisions (Ownership, gates, handoffs)
- Greg Castellucci to run point with Google Federal and coordinate with the corporate GDC team over the next few weeks.
- Jason Vallery to connect Greg with Google stakeholders and drive RFP content assembly.
- Alon Horev to conduct a 1:1 session with Muninder Sambi on AI, VM shapes, and storage tradeoffs.
- "Leo" to own the end-to-end RFP response and submissions.
- Use Fort Meade on-prem Gemini effort as the primary validation path and reference.
- Include Dell and HPE SKU recommendations and consider Cisco/commodity VM options in proposals.

## Risks (channel conflict, roadmap gaps, certification)
- Alignment gap between Google corporate GDC and Google Federal teams could slow decisions.
- No marquee air-gapped GDC customer yet; lack of anchor tenant may hinder momentum.
- Tight timelines (requests to meet "tomorrow") risk incomplete responses or missed stakeholders.
- Vendor and hardware alignment (Dell/HPE/Cisco) plus NetApp incumbency could complicate positioning.
- Compliance/ATO evidence may be sensitive or hard to share, risking perceived readiness.
- Resource constraints (e.g., Greg’s upcoming Leidos focus) may impact continuity without a handoff.

## Open Questions
- Exact list of Google stakeholders to engage across GDC corporate and Federal (mapping and ownership).
- Which certifications/attestations Google requires for GDC air-gapped (e.g., DISA STIG specifics, ATO expectations).
- Will Google permit VAST to run on commodity VM shapes with RDMA and what shapes are preferred?
- Which hardware platforms (Dell/HPE/Cisco) should be prioritized for short-term validation and long-term scale?
- Can the Fort Meade timeline and scope be used explicitly in the RFP as past performance/validation?
- Clarify whether "Leo" is the same as or different from "Lior" to avoid owner ambiguity.
- How will licensing/commercials work for air-gapped (marketplace/BYOL) scenarios?

## Original Transcript
[00:00:00.02]   RemoteSo I'm excited.

[00:00:01.76]  Jason Vallery- Okay, well you get--

[00:00:03.10]   Remote- It does take years off my life every year, but other than that, it's all good.

[00:00:09.59]  Jason Vallery- Well, maybe I should introduce myself and get you guys to do the same because I'm the new guy here. I started at Vast about three weeks ago, weeks ago. I'm reporting to Jeff looking at product management for the cloud. Obviously I'm sure you guys have seen all the work that's happening in the cloud and you know Yahtzee joining and the announcements around Google. We're aggressively going after building the right product strategy and partnerships to really be successful there. There's a lot of work to still do. I'm joining from Microsoft. I spent the last 13 years running product management for Azure Blob Storage. Randy, I saw on your profile you were part of Avere. That's exciting. Your name was familiar, so now it's starting to click, but I definitely worked with the Avere team a little bit. and then they evolved into the Azure Managed Cache and other things. So that's kind of my background. Before we jump into the Google conversation, I'd love to learn a little bit about you guys.

[00:01:16.61]   Remote- Sure. So I'll just go real quick. I'm the vice president of public sector, so the federal stuff rolls up to me. I spent exactly 45 days at Microsoft after the Avere acquisition knowing that I was going to come work here, and so that was about seven and a half years ago, give or take. So I have a pretty good idea around all the different cloud providers. because especially in the federal side they were all pretty new when I was at Avere and we had a good chunk of business that we did on the federal side supporting both on-prem object as well as in the cloud and I did always find it hilarious that we didn't even support Azure Blob at Avere. here when we got acquired by Microsoft, and then they had to spend like six months like making that work, and I was like, I'm a sales guy. You're telling me I can't get paid for six months? Hasta la vista. Like, thank you much, but no thank you. So, yeah. So anyways, been in basically federal.

[00:02:37.75]  Jason ValleryStorage my whole career. Well, you made the right call early on. I wish I would have joined Bass seven years ago, but it is what it is. I'm here now, so I'm excited. We were doing a little bit of a round of intro just to kind of set a little context on what I'm looking at and why I'm, you know, kind of randomly dropping an invite on you. on Friday. You know, Randy signed you guys up, so just blame him. But, you know, the back story is I'm joining very recently to Vast and I'm working on our partnerships with our hyperscale cloud providers. I'm joining from Microsoft, where I ran product for Azure Storage for the last 13 years. years. But that's not what this is about. This is about Google. We've been working with Google on, you may have seen we announced Marketplace offers with them last week, it's kind of a big deal, but it's early days in terms of the broader partnership and strategy and product integration. Google has invited us to participate in an RFP, which we're responding to currently for supporting their AirGap, well, I should say their Google Distributed Cloud. The Google Distributed Cloud is their offering to customers who want to have a GCP-like experience, but deploy it into private or hybrid data centers, and so they support a variety of customers that want to do that. to run in local environments so their marquee customer there is McDonald's. Apparently every single McDonald's store has a rack of servers in it powered by Google Distributed Cloud and they also offer an air-gapped version of it that they target for government customers and federal customers. That's where you folks come in. They want us to respond in this RFP to replace their current storage solution. In the Google Distributed Cloud offering today, they partner with NetApp, and so if you're deploying one of these systems, you also have to go and buy a bunch of NetApp hardware and deploy it alongside, and that becomes file and block storage for Google Distributed Cloud, and this opportunity is for us. to replacement, and I think there's a good, there's a good chance we'll be successful here. We met with Google yesterday and the takeaways, I put some of the actions in the chat, but you know, they, they want to really deeply understand what it means for us to run arrogant, and that's also an overlay of what it really means to run. for our US government sovereign customers and supporting compliance, certifications, attestations, what environments we're allowed to deploy in, what customer evidence we have of successful existing deployments, what our operations model look like, how we do updates, how we troubleshoot, how we staff. They really want us to kind of... of provide some deep dive conversations about that. I know nothing about those topics as it relates to VAST. I have some experience on it in Microsoft's side, and so that's why I'm kind of reaching out to this group. So I don't know where we go next, but what Google has asked for is a formal response to the bullets I just listed, and then a meeting with the relevant folks from our side that can help educate them.

[00:06:00.11]   RemoteAre you familiar with our past work with Jeremiah and Greg and others on the DoD/IC side with Google?

[00:06:09.10]  Jason ValleryI know absolutely nothing about what's been going on in that, so hopefully you guys can educate me.

[00:06:16.14]   RemoteJeremiah, you want to jump on that real quick, technically? And then Greg, you can talk about the business piece. So as you might know there Jason, Google can't bring certain parts of their services to disconnected places because there's just too much entanglement. So one of the things they were looking at us as a stopgap was our catalog and our AI capabilities to kind of backfill their BigQuery solution problem. We don't really know how far that got, but we've been working pretty closely with their intelligence community team. That's great. Help me out. It's Yan and... Oh, it's Jan. Jan Niemus runs the DoD IC organization for Google. Yeah. This happens to be a personal friend of mine, right? of ties into this, into that group, Jason, which has been good. Is that what you were trying to hint at? Yeah, trying to get his name right. Yeah, yeah. Basically, the DoD IC team sees the value prop, understands that we're built for offline and air-gapped installations. It's not It's not a yeah, and we can do that. It's a yeah, we do that, or we could do this other thing.

[00:07:35.53]  Jason Vallery- The folks we met with yesterday were their core product management team and engineering team. So they were not air gap specific or IC folks. They were just, you know, kind of corporate Google engineering. I don't know how they're connected within Google, so certainly one of the things I'd love to get from you is who the key stakeholders you've partnered with at Google so I can maybe even connect dots on the Google side and say these conversations have already been started. So that's a clear, actually we can take what how far are those conversations so I mean like they didn't imply any of this had ever even been. been brought up with VAST, the folks I spoke to yesterday. So maybe there's a disconnect there. How far are those conversations?

[00:08:23.10]   RemoteWe actually were going to team together on a IC pursuit that ended up not going anywhere. But it was a very heavy teaming discussion, where again, we would be the big query for Google. and and they and they would uh partner with us there that solicitation got canceled by the government but um moving forward though greg i know we've worked on we've got lab stuff that were we were working now i believe yes so jan who runs their DoD IC business, was used to be one of the vice presidents of Cisco's DoD IC sector. He came over to Google to run the same sector for Google and brought with him a lot of Cisco people. With that came that linkage into Cisco, which was timely for us, 'cause we just announced the Cisco partnership. This was like early summer. right? And what the initial idea was to get this proof of concept done, right? Because, Jen, what you alluded to was opportunity in the IC sector that apparently Google made the down-select and we made the down-select, but it was two different products and that's kind of what That's why we probably wouldn't have won that if we if it did get awarded. That was the only reason so Google's like How do we make this a product and then so Jan brought Cisco to the table? We met in beginning of June out there Great Gralic was there to Jen we talked about putting this proof of concept together and ever since then it's just been trying to to get the equipment racked and stacked somewhere. Google found half of it, or Cisco found half the gear. They're waiting for Google to come back and approve the location, and that's where I am right now, Jason. But this is what we're going to do, and this is a POC, Jan's approved it. He's pushing on it on his side. threshold or where we can get this thing racked and stacked and we can actually do this POC. It's a vast stack on Cisco gear with Google Gemini, right? That's the whole thing that they really want to take to market in the DoD IC space. But that's the driving factor that was pushing that IC proof of concept at Fort Meade in the first place, right? this whole thing, one of the three other agencies wanted to be able to get an AI, a large-language model initiative going at that base, and our guy met with the Google rep to say, "Hey, let's do this." And that's kind of where it started, Jason. So that's the end. That's what's going on. I was going to say, that deal's in commit for Q4. So Gemini as a service on-prem at Fort Meade is about as real as it's gonna be. So that's, you know, another thing that we can just kind of, you know, pull on a little bit, but I think it makes sense that we probably need to get the federal team at least talking to the corporate team, because in my eyes, there's probably two paths. There's a path, there's like the federal path, which, you know, we've done a lot of work on and then there's the commercial path and per usual, the vast federal team is the canary in the coal mine, getting people to commit to shit before it's actually done. and then we go build it, and so I think that's a really interesting path forward. - So I have, so Jason, one of the things to make you and Randy aware of, this just happened like a week and a half ago, right? Right before the GTC conference. Olivia Borey, have you met Olivia, Jason?

[00:12:18.73]  Jason Vallery- I have.

[00:12:19.57]   Remote- Yeah, Olivia and I, Olivia reached out to me Greg we want to sync up with federal team better than we have. That's a great idea and I shared everything we're doing she's like how can we help federal that was like and that's the first time I think we've ever heard that right you know so Olivia and I did synced up I think what's the guy's name Ivar or Igar or she reports to Lior yeah Lior Lior was also on the call with me and said he's behind helping us too and I let Olivia know what we were doing here and she's like wow that sounds fantastic how can we help you and then she set up a couple of calls you know with me and that corporate team Jason so they know what we're trying to do and they want to help us so having you on the call here today is perfect timing. Right, so I'm working on linking up our Fed sales team to the Google Fed sales teams where I can make those linkages. 'Cause Randy and I were just on a call earlier where that makes total sense for an FBI deal we're gonna work on, and there's another one coming up at the Department of State and another one with the U.S. Army with J.B. Right, so one of our Epson Army.

[00:13:31.31]  Jason Vallery- But just to clarify, those are also Google deals?

[00:13:33.08]   RemoteYeah, well no, they're account, joint account sharing, how can we both win? There's pieces of Google there and there's pieces for us, and we're like, let's get together. Is there something that we can help Google with or something Google helps us with, right? So I'm making those linkages right now, Jason, where it makes sense. Some of those pieces and those opportunities include both. There's a hybrid cloud piece here. That's kind of what we had a meeting on earlier today. A lot of these initiatives have hybrid cloud components and our preference is to go with Google on these 'cause of the relationship and the corporate level initiatives that are going on, Jason. So that's what we're up to right now.

[00:14:12.16]  Jason Vallery>> Okay, Alon was with me yesterday. bringing up to speed. What we learned is that the Fort Meade opportunity is very

[00:14:20.27]   RemoteReal. It's a Q4 deal that's already there. I heard that from Randy. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Let me, first of all, nice meeting you Jen and Greg and Jeremiah. Never met you guys. means that we're doing our job and keeping things separated, but no, seriously, I am happy to meet you and be involved as much as I can in federal activities, not being a U.S. citizen. We got into that situation yesterday with that senior guy in Google. you know prior warning or a good understanding of what it is that they want to do and it's not clear that I need to stay in the loop nor Jason is right like he's focused on cloud and there is the hybrid cloud component and you know we're not the we're not the bureaucratic company where we have tight definitions for what people are doing otherwise wouldn't have been successful. So Jason, you know, especially being new in the company is like sucking information in and he would be happy to continue being involved. But I do wanna make sure that we are, we have the right action items because we had interesting momentum yesterday with this Monendo guy, okay? He was a CVP of networking for GCP, very senior networking guy. Him and another peer joked on how much they don't know storage, but now that Munindar is like head of uh what it is like supply chain for for good to the Google distributed cloud, he understands that he needs to understand more, and we had a really good conversation, and he mentioned a few things. So we came out with like 20 action items for that meeting, and we do need to double down on this relationship, because it already sounds there is a bunch of joint activity. know when you're saying there's good alignment on the business side there should be good alignment on the technical side because we can now talk about the joint solution where we would basically be supporting all of the applications right from from a data perspective and then we can go across the entire technical stack it's not just you know setting in the same place which is what they asked us for but it was initiated by Michelle who's like head of partnerships or something like that. She gave me like a briefing saying, "Hey, there's two opportunities that you guys need to be involved in. There's an RFP for Google Distributed Cloud that we're answering." Again, I don't know if like who invests federal also needs to go over it. answer it but we got the feeling yesterday this is very much colored for federal in a sense that he'd like his biggest doubt or biggest you know thing he wants us to prove is that we can actually support the dark side customer an air gap environment that was like he went on and on over this I said like you know he said like you know we need to see proof we would need to go out there what happens. I was like, just as an FYI, we just closed like the 1.5 billion quarter, like there's a lot of customers you can talk to. He said, yeah, but none of those dollars are for air gap system. I said, that's not correct. I said, I'm not privy to how many of those dollars come from vast federal, but we definitely have air gap customers, and I'm familiar with some of them because they're not all in the US. We have some in Israel too. and we have methods and how to support him so he was impressed that we have something but we're not as impressive as HP or Cisco in terms of their support force or sales force and I think they also need to understand that aspect of you know how could like does vast plus HP or vast plus Cisco is it better than just vast it's not right in many cases it would feel like we're giving someone someone else like the having someone else do the heavy lifting which makes things complicated in terms of accountability and the quality that you're going to get eventually so I think those are challenges for us as a group like he wanted to understand what are my harder options I also want to make sure and this he understands the And then the fact that HP and Cisco are actually making it easier for us to scale because we're only 1,200 people, right? So those are, I think, two very important things, and, okay, so we have a bunch of action items, a bunch of follow-ups to do, okay? Okay. Other things that they think worth mentioning that he said, are out of curiosity, the dark. The guy that he there were you referring to that was asking about dark site air gap, who was moon in those zombie.

[00:19:26.83]  Jason ValleryYeah, he's all up CDP for Google Distributed Cloud. and the connected side.

[00:19:31.68]   Remote- Just curious if Jeremiah or anybody else knew him from your Seth Haynes connections and whatnot.

[00:19:39.66]  Jason Vallery- And he just, he's new in role. He was in a different part of Google until last couple of months.

[00:19:45.18]   Remote- Yeah, so I don't think it's just federal, because of that focus that he had yesterday on the call on the air-gapped environments, and then he said something like, we should find a joint customer and get this to work as soon as possible. Well, there you go. So I was like, you know, you want us to, you want to go over accounts, you know, you'll go over a list of accounts. You're like, yes. Now, Jason, you said that you've been back-channeling with someone over there at Google saying that they don't currently have those types of customers. I don't think that's correct based on what was just said here about Fort Meade.

[00:20:29.86]  Jason Vallery- What I heard, and maybe we'll learn different through this, is that they don't have a marquee, like, anchor tenant. They haven't got anyone fully. deeply embedded in it. They've got folks trying it, using it at small scale, but they don't have any big marquee, anchor, air-gapped customers. Now, maybe you guys know better, and that's not correct information, but that's what I

[00:20:50.56]   RemoteHeard. Well, they've been ... What's the best way to say this? They worked against themselves about six or seven years ago, where they ... They had some internal Google people that didn't want to support a program that was very nation-centric for the U.S., and they got a black eye like you've never seen before, and so they've been trying to work themselves back in. into favoritism, which I think they've done a pretty decent job, but I would agree there aren't any like marquee, like this is Google's biggest air gap customer. I think they're fighting AWS tooth and nail, um, on, you know, a lot of these types of workloads, and what's interesting to me was we met with the Google team at GTC and they were actually really interested in the AirGap discussion and the on-prem discussion, which tells me that they're probably desperate for revenue and they're willing to do unnatural things to get that revenue. So I do believe that it will be a good partnership if we can do kind of the hybrid things that we've been discussing. So there's a bunch of action items that we can, like, we have all of this documented for the most part. So that's pretty easy as far as like air gap support and dark side support. we have Doden APLs like you know, by the way, this is all online. So I'm not saying anything that I shouldn't be saying so just for everybody else a lot of this stuff is available just on the internet and so we can put a list of links that are open source and or available to anybody in the world around what some of these requirements look like that I think will at least answer the mail, and then it's really just aligning the internal product people with the fact that we're already working multiple deals and I've done RFI and RFP responses with the Google Federal team already. ready, and we have pretty good relationships with those folks that would be most interested in this type of workload. In the past performance, we can obfuscate as needed, but past performance-wise, we have a lot of on-prem solutions that don't right now include Google, but really high-performance. the robustness of the security of the platform from a multi-tenant perspective. Yep, and our ability to get ATOs or authority to operate in some of these, you know, very highly classified locations. We can talk vaguely about the ATOs. But I think we'll say enough that shows we know how to handle these customers, I think is probably the biggest takeaway.

[00:24:08.26]  Jason VallerySo what I'd like to agree on is how we take this forward. I think we need a point person from federal to own who's going to drive these conversations with us today and follow-ups around it, you know, where Alon and I come in or the broader What are we going to do if we need to take things back into the vast product to evolve supporting these air gap customers? I certainly want to be involved in those conversations, but in terms of just the commercial pursuit, the joint pursuit to support for me that otherwise, I think it would make more sense for somebody in federal to be on point for that. So I would think we kind of get you guys engaged with the folks.

[00:24:45.44]   RemoteMet yesterday. I can spearhead that right now, Jennifer. If you want full disclosure, Greg is going to be 100% dedicated to Leidos next year because they're kicking our ass in a great way. But right now he is our Google person in Fed. >> DIRECTOR DEWOLF: So the way I see this is that we need someone to be focused over the next few weeks because I mean the guy in that room said can you guys meet tomorrow, and I said yes. Right, and I said you know I said the minute you put something on my calendar I'm going to pull in the relevant folks. So. sense of urgency from a big executive in Google is a good thing. If-- as long as Greg can push this for the next few weeks and we see where it goes, if it goes anywhere, we can-- I can back up, as well, and then Jeremy has been our test. So let's-- I suggest the following. If Jeff was here, I would ask him, like, how does he feel? I mean, the last thing I care about, or I manage, is who's doing what. But I would ask, like, what's the right way to partition the responsibilities here? But because he's not here, I'm going to offer the following. Jason connects Greg saying, hey, here's the point of contact from VATS Federal. You can ask all your federal related questions, right? And this is, there are actually people that want to talk, which is great, beyond the RFP. What I suggest Jason would do is add, work with Greg, and make sure that we add to the RFP notes, or like, you know, answers and information based on everything they asked yesterday. certifications right like the DISA STIG thing they asked about encryption features they asked about quotas they asked about multi-tenancy they asked about like I just sent an email added to that thread they asked about you know how do we support a dark side customer we can say so we can put something in writing there that's small and then use that conversation to actually see what they care about and talk in that conversation, by the way, I would also talk about the Cisco and HP thing because they, I think they partnered mostly with Dell, but they also said that, you know, they run the, the GCP stack on, or a subset of it on Dells on Dell gear, but they also have done it with HP, it sounds like, okay. So, yeah, I told them. - That's our understanding as well, is it's mostly Dell servers and NetApp from a storage infrastructure perspective, but I think there's opportunity there. I don't think they really care, other than the Google and NetApp twin brothers, they're kind of a thing, but like that's a... thing that we can deal with. But I think to that notion, you know, Greg can jump on this. Jen and myself certainly can provide backfill capabilities because we know what's going on and the stack and all those things. So, I agree as far as, you know, moving forward, Greg can run point, and then Greg, if you have other things going on and we need to jump on something else, um, you know, obviously feel free to bring Jenna and myself in, and then, um, you know, Jeremiah has got a buddy over there as well, uh, that he used to work with. So we, we have a lot of also back channels that we can go in and have a very pointed conversation with, uh, the federal team, and then we can. line some of that stuff? Because I think the federal team on the Google side will be our friendliest part of Google, is my gut feeling. Yeah, they were very friendly yesterday and it felt to me like it was almost as friendly as looking at us as a channel, not only just as a technology enabler. but Munindo also wanted me to teach him about AI. So there's an opportunity. Now I would say what I'm going to do. He wanted a personal follow-up for me to teach them what AI looks like from our perspective, and I think it's an opportunity just for me to say, let's do it one-on-one, to kind of build a relationship with this guy. Then he also said that, "Hey, I'm gonna just show you like the VM shapes "that we have and you tell us what you can do with it." Like he's not in the mindset of building storage and optimizing for capacity and performance, and when I said that, they said, "Listen, like if you have RDMA or you don't, "if you have this or that, "like those are trade-offs that affect price." affect density, affect performance, affect latency. It's like this is exactly the things that we need to know for us to make good decisions, right? Maybe the fact that NetApp wasn't fungible because you had to select very specific hardware is a downside compared to VaST being able to provision, to be provisioned on top of the same Dell servers, right? So there's also a technology play here that can that can be really good for us. Alone, alone, 50, 50 billion dollars feels like a really good acquisition target for Google for vast, so just keep that in mind as well. OK, it's good that you have a target. Now I need to know what to look for in the negotiation. - I have a, hopefully not a dumb question, but just technically, just because this came up on a previous call, Randy's probably gonna chuckle when I say it, but as we go to market or we look to go to market with a Google, would that, I mean, obviously that's a model builder type relationship, right? So our customers can be better model builders in different ways. um would that mean that we they would enable us to run any an LLM on VAST using some of their software? So there there's when Michelle the the head of partnerships told me that there's two tracks or that they want us to she wants to make sure that we have the opportunity to participate one of them is this one the other one is the TPUs. So Google is now selling chips to various model builders and they want to make sure those chips stay productive and they know that the only way to keep GPUs productive and reliable is with VAST. So we I don't know where that track is standing. It sounds like this one has like this the track that we're discussing here as a proper RFP and it's more imminent. But I think those like there's people that think that all of those things can come together Right because if Google distributed cloud can also bring in Gemini with their TPUs, that's great Right, the fact is by the way that so far they built They took like a very a very shallow part of the GCP stack and it's all commodity hard Like, even the GPUs, they're not TPUs, they're proper GPUs. When they're doing Gemini on-prem, it's not with Google TPUs. So I think at some point they're going to say, "Okay, we have an opportunity to improve our margins and actually showcase our technology," which is now being used by Anthropic and the others. So I can see them drawing lines. So when I'm going to talk to Meninder about... I want them to see that future that vast is the future-proof kind of platform for them to build on top, right? And then the other thing okay, so that's my action item because I promised him that Jason he'll take the RFP and and call and collect information with Greg. Yeah, and and make the information So Greg can work independently with those folks, and then there should be a next step, which is kind of an architecture review, which is assuming everyone's happy and they want to do something together, what does the hardware look like? Do we run on commodity VMs or servers? Do they bring in a D-box or a C-box or is that the Cisco E-box and all of that, right? So Jason and Greg, I would say that after your first call with them, let's figure out where they stand, but, you know, Monindo did want to be practical. So on that call, when we can, you can do, you know, mention accounts where we are already collaborating, apparently, and just try to be aggressive. because this is what they wanted. Let's say, you know, we're already there together. Why do you want to see? What do you want to do? Right? Like, yeah, I believe the Fort Meade opportunity is on HPE e-boxes or Dell e-boxes. I forget exactly which one, but it's definitely going to be an e-box config because it's, you know, it's a double digit petabyte opportunity. So it's perfect. that would be perfect okay and by the way when it's hpe for evox is that green link for file or just vast on top of evox no we're meeting it's meeting the channel so uh hpe was __ around too much and the customer was like nope we're just gonna buy the software we're gonna buy the hardware so um that's best case scenario for all of us because we get paid 100% versus not the, you know, knocked down version of GreenLake Profile, and the customer gets the full stack from VaST, not the knocked down version. I agree. This is a great precedent. Like, I wouldn't want them to have the first experience with GreenLake Profile where the customer sees something like, you know, Google, HP, VaST, and it's like... a long chain of uh yep yep okay okay it was that at hp eletra elitra gear but josh redid the the whole system and made it work right that's that's the platform it's on on the electro elytra stuff that's yeah that's that's hardware though but it's not it's not a green light for file From a business perspective, it's meat in the channel, so they're getting the full stack, like I don't give a shit about hardware. Yeah, yeah, that's what the hardware is, but yeah, yeah, exactly. Okay, makes sense. Okay, so I think we're all aligned. Jason, can you corroborate the intro to Greg?

[00:35:11.77]  Jason ValleryYep, kicking off some emails right now.

[00:35:14.62]   RemoteOkay, and I will... we'll follow up with Munindo for the one-on-one, and we'll take it from there.

[00:35:26.23]  Jason Vallery- Awesome.

[00:35:27.07]   RemoteAre you gonna be at Supercomputing next week? - I am. - All right, I'll see you then.

[00:35:32.94]  Jason Vallery- Cool. - Thank you all.

[00:35:35.83]   Remote- Thank you for allowing me to be on the Zoom with you guys. We actually have been doing quite a bit of this collective Zoom lately with our systems integrators. Most of them don't allow or don't mind a one-way street. The end user customers are a little different, but the integrators are a little more open. Cool. Yeah. As long as the guys are there. any good job, I don't mind. (laughing) - Jason, we'll follow up with you, I guess.

[00:36:07.29]  Jason Vallery- Yeah. - Whenever you're ready. - I'll kick off a couple of emails and I'll make sure you guys are on it. - Okay. - You see the Google team.

[00:36:12.29]   Remote- Hey Jason, who owns the RFP response? Is that Leo?

[00:36:17.71]  Jason Vallery- Leo is working on it, yeah. So I'll bring Leo into it as well.

[00:36:20.65]   Remote- Okay. We just gave you, Jason. a bunch of tasks that don't necessarily fall into your current title, just to make Jeff and relevant people aware of it, because I think you have what to contribute here, and I can't think of anyone else to do it better. Right. We're all good. Is that a U.S.-based RFP that's coming out, Jason? Is that a U.S.-based one? Yes.

[00:36:45.66]  Jason ValleryI mean, yeah, it is. Like I said, like I opened with, this is their RFP to take out NetApp and they have another solution for the connected sides. So the RFP isn't specifically around AirGap, but yesterday the conversation was fully focused on AirGap. So we still have to respond to this RFP. It's not a guarantee. This is just them doing vendor due diligence. at this point. Presumably they're looking at others beyond VAST, and so they're wanting to learn about us in this context. I'll send you the RFP as well so you can see it.

[00:37:17.69]   RemoteSounds good. Cool. Okay. Thank you, folks. Thanks, guys. Thanks, team.
