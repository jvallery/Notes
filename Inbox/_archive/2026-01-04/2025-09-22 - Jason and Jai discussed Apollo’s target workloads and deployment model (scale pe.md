# 1:1 — Jai Menon — 2025-09-22

> [!info] Purpose
> Build trust, surface and remove blockers, align on priorities, coach & grow.

## Summary

Jason and Jai discussed Apollo’s target workloads and deployment model (scale per site, geo disaggregation, energy-centric placements). Jason outlined throughput-driven storage ratios, the need for a persistent, strongly consistent KV store across sites, and differences between large-scale pre-training vs fine-tuning/RL. Jason will probe a critical workload status with Pete and asked for direction on next research areas; he has already left comments on Apollo docs.

## Key facts learned

- Apollo needs clarity on target GPU cluster sizes (4K vs 8K GPUs) and per-site scale.
- Prior 8K-GPU design assumed ~100 PB storage (throughput-driven) with a ~120-rack cluster and ~2.5 TB/s throughput; more like ~120 PB storage in reality.
- OpenAI historically over-provisioned checkpoint storage and did periodic cleanup; petabytes were not the constraint.
- Shift to online reinforcement learning implies training and inference sharing GPUs, changing storage and consistency needs.
- Energy-centric deployments via partners (e.g., CoreWeave, Nebbius) imply disaggregated footprints across geos.
- Vast/CoreWeave are pursuing persistent, strongly consistent key-value storage across disaggregated GPUs, with Kafka-style change logs and a shared namespace.
- Apollo may require a shared namespace spanning blobs and KV store with strong consistency across sites.
- Report of another ‘Matt UK’ supercomputer deal possibly tied to Satya’s UK investment announcement.
- DFW enrichment sites referenced with ~160,000 GB200s under one roof, similar in scale to Fairwater.
- Large IB-connected data centers still needed for foundation model training; fine-tuning/RL can run at smaller scale without InfiniBand.
- Concern about potentially losing a high-TPS Databricks storage workload (system of record) and broader competitive capacity dynamics.
- Jason has added comments to Apollo docs and requested guidance on next research topics; he plans to probe with Pete.

## Outcomes

- Acknowledged need to clarify Apollo workload targets and geo-disaggregation requirements.
- Recognition that Apollo storage should consider a persistent, strongly consistent KV store and shared namespace across sites.
- Jason will inquire with Pete about the status of a critical workload.
- Jason’s comments on Apollo documents are available for review.

## Risks

- Loss of high-TPS Databricks/OpenAI-related workload could move system of record off Azure.
- Execution risk: slow conversion of ideas into delivered capabilities.
- Capacity and supplier musical chairs may disadvantage Microsoft if not addressed.
- Apollo may underperform without a strongly consistent cross-site KV and shared namespace.
- Unclear Apollo scale/disaggregation targets could lead to misaligned architecture.

## Open questions

- What are the target GPU counts and per-site scales for Apollo (4K vs 8K GPUs)?
- How disaggregated should Apollo be across geographies given energy-centric placements?
- What is the required throughput per GPU and corresponding storage sizing for Apollo, considering checkpointing and RL workloads?
- Should Apollo implement a persistent, strongly consistent KV store with a shared namespace across sites (blobs + KV)?
- For Apollo, when is InfiniBand required (foundation pre-training) versus optional (fine-tuning/RL)?
- What is the current status of right of first refusal with OpenAI and the high-TPS Databricks storage workload?
- Is the reported ‘Matt UK’ supercomputer part of Apollo or Fairwater?

[00:00:00.03] Parallels Desktop : >> Jay, how are you, sir?

[00:00:21.46] Jason Vallery :  Jason ValleryAll your prepped for the Apollo meeting or something else? Yeah, I went through the talk this morning and the chat thread and kind of got a sense of what you guys are thinking about, and yeah, when is this off-site? this week? Not a physical thing? Okay, I thought there was some physical meeting

[00:00:55.65] Parallels Desktop : Get-together. Got it. Okay.PAUSE Gotcha.PAUSEPAUSEPAUSEPAUSE (audience laughing) You You You You You You Thank you.silence for the rest of the videoNO SPEECHNO SPEECH you Yousilence for the rest of the video YouBLANK I'm going to stop sharing my screen because it's going to take a little bit longer.Pause for group work

[00:09:59.66] Jason Vallery :  Jason ValleryOkay. Before I jump in with Mark's thoughts on the ratios and all that, which I do have, I want to ask a couple of probing questions. Apollo, in its version that we're kind of thinking about it, is there a target set of workloads and scale of these data centers? I mean, are they 4K, 8K GPUs? with a 160,000 KGBUs like the Freedom Data Center. I do have a sense for what each one of these footprints look like, and then the layer on top of that is how disaggregated across geos should we consider?

[00:10:31.47] Parallels Desktop : Pause for group workSilence from 00:42 to 00:48 you You

[00:12:00.21] Jason Vallery :  Jason ValleryI have, you know, obviously, um, some visibility into the data center plans that were there before I went on break and then layered in with speculation that I would add big. on partnerships we've been signing with CoreWeave and Nebbius and all that, I mean, those are very public. You would imagine that what's really happening here is that we're seeking energy centric deployments, right? We're going to go where the power is located, which means it's going to end up being somewhat disaggregated in terms of footprint. So, you know, I assume that to be one of the core requirements, we should be. thinking about is that we'll end up having diverse locations for a single customer that are a varying scale. But before I get to my point around that, let me just answer your other point around the 100 pebabyte per 4k 8k GPU and how that relates to checkpointing and I think all of this kind of comes together with some clarity. You know, those requirements were driven out of throughput. It was not driven out of Pebabyte being the actual requirement that was driving their decision. It was driven out of how much throughput per GPU do we really want? What can Blob deliver? You do the reverse calculation on the math and you land at forever, and where we were at, again, was 8K GPUs and that was a change because at one point we did have a requirement of 4K GPUs. We need 100 petabytes of storage and actually the proxy for that was 120 RAC cluster. 120 RAC cluster at the point we were saying is about two and a half terabytes of throughput and in reality it's more like 120 petabytes of storage. when we were defining these ratios with OpenAI, it was based on that assumption. Now, OpenAI, as you said, doesn't need 120 petabytes of checkpoint storage, and because they have so much capacity, they've actually been historically not particularly great about data retention and lifecycle of checkpoints because the petabytes weren't the thing that were the constraint, and so they could.., and then they would just go on a big housecleaning expedition once they started to fill up, and then they'd let it sit for a while and then they'd go through housecleaning again, and I think that's relevant if what you're really doing with these is traditional pre-training curo training. The thing that I feel like is missing in the workload context is the switch to online reinforcement And what that really means for the requirements here, when you're running both inferencing and training on the same GPUs, and look, that's what OpenAI publicly acknowledged they did when they had a giant traffic spike. They took research GPUs and used them to host consumer workloads. envision these Apollo data centers must be fungible between pre-training, inferencing, and in the future, as they build more and more agentic systems, the agents themselves. In that world, I think the storage requirements are fundamentally different, and it's why I was sort of probing on the initial point around scale and disaggregation. So, let me add some more context. What I've been focused on in the last couple of weeks is really just trying to get my head fully around the capabilities of CoreWeave, their Chaos thing, Loda, and Vast. Really what Vast shipped, what are they saying in their roadmap, what are they building? And I think they get this, right? The thing that they're shooting for is persistent key value storage. Well, I'm specifically focused on BASC for this point, but then by proxy CoreWeave gets to be a beneficiary of this because they're running BASC. They're putting a ton of effort into the end-to-end data pipeline. They built this Kafka streaming thing that ties back into their key value store, and what I see them building is persistent, strongly consistent key value stores that across disaggregated GPUs. They're their day's architecture is what they describe it disaggregated shared everything. So what I think they're marching towards is this vision where you've got GPUs running in a whole bunch of different places, running the agentic workloads, the test time Accessing a shared key-value store that then has strong consistency across these sites with local versions.

[00:17:16.72] Parallels Desktop : VIDEO PLAYBACK

[00:17:36.54] Jason Vallery :  Jason Vallery- But it's moreINAUDIBLE integrated in what we do, right? Because what they're using is their storage data namespace, the data spaces thing, which is part of data store for the consistency, and then they've got this data pipeline Kafka thing that they're using to push change logs across the different sites to enable that. have a thin layer over top of that for the KV store or whatever kind of store they want, and like, I think if you're talking about Apollo in the way I think you're describing it, like that's what's needed there, right? Is that you have some amount of super performant Jboff latch that can have a shared namespace across these Apollo sites so that you could... expose one namespace and it could contain blobs, it could contain a key value store, and you've got that consistency, and I mean obviously I know our stack is nowhere near that. That's what I think Apollo really needs if it truly is these sort of multi-site, multi-geo kind of deployments.

[00:18:45.33] Parallels Desktop : YouAUDIO You You YeahPause for group work

[00:21:00.37] Jason Vallery :  Jason ValleryAnd so I talked to Jack, I don't know if you know Jack, I talked to him last week and he was saying there was another Matt UK deal that is going down and I don't know if that's the Apollo or a Fairwater design or what, but then I assume that's, you know, the undertone of the Satya announcement about our UK investments, but it sounds like we are close to signing another supercomputer for Matt UK.

[00:21:24.13] Parallels Desktop : Pause for group work

[00:21:46.88] Jason Vallery :  Jason ValleryThe DFW enrichment sites, I don't know what it is in terms of megawatts, but I know there's like 160,000 something GB200s going to them. It's probably about that, between $1,000 and $3,000.

[00:22:14.98] Parallels Desktop : In one, one building under one roof.

[00:22:31.51] Jason Vallery :  Jason ValleryI mean, huge, like the Fairwater site.

[00:22:44.91] Parallels Desktop : 10 seconds pause Yeah.10 seconds pause

[00:23:10.42] Jason Vallery :  Jason ValleryI mean, I think the core difference, and to the point of large-scale training runs versus fine-tuning is what happens is they use the really big data center that's also InfiniBand connected to train the foundation model, and I still think you have to build those. But then once you've got that, you can do fine-tuning at a smaller scale in that reinforcement learning loop, right? So you only need the really big data center once a generation and then take that model and now you're constantly fine-tuning it based on its output at a lower precision floating point number. So you don't need the crazy infiniBand at that point. So that's how OpenAI has been running for a while. That's what XAI has talked about they're doing, right? That's what's they're doing in Colossus. They've been super cagey about this, at least in the meetings I've been with them, and obviously this is now three months to go, so the whole world could have changed, but they were working on that. What I understood to be happening was that they could compartmentalize. and do subcomponents of the model across regions. So that there, and I don't know how this works with the mixture of experts and routing engines and all of that they're building on top of GPD 5, but they would have more domain specific parts of the model trained in each different tranche. Versus trying to train one big gigantic multi trillion parameter model. model across regions. I don't think they've got there yet, right mixture of everything. So they train smaller models that are narrowly focused on a. small problem area and have the weights associated like a math model and an English language model and a coding model or whatever, right? And then those things get aggregated via a router that then gets trained into the big multi-trillion parameter model that can be across all multi modalities and everything, right? I heard they were hopping mad as of like a week and a half ago that they were like out of capacity. But I didn't hear that they had made some ability to move off of us. I mean, that would be the cash cow workload, frankly, because it's Databricks plus Spark and it's the one that's driving all the TPS and where the. warehouses and the capacity and all their raw data. You know, I'm curious because when I last engaged, we still had right of first refusal. So it was up to us to say, if we can't give you the capacity, you can go elsewhere, but otherwise it's an Azure.

[00:27:00.48] Parallels Desktop : I don't know if you can hear me, but I think we're getting much better.

[00:27:27.48] Jason Vallery :  Jason ValleryI'm having lunch with Pete on Friday, so I'll probe there when I meet with him, but yeah, I'd be, I'd be curious what happened there. I mean, that was a workload I was babysitting for the last year and a half, right? Well, at least it didn't happen on my watch. That's exactly what I was hinting at. Well, all I'm saying, at least it didn't happen on my watch. No, I mean, it's super, obviously, like, catastrophic to lose that one, because, you know, then the data's-- the system of record in that data is no longer on Azure. I'd be curious-- I'd be super curious to, like, where are we going? It was definitely the highest TPS, highest throughput storage account we had on the platform is that Chattopadhyay Databricks account. What I'm super curious about, though, is that like it's tightly coupled with the compute, So to lose that storage workload is a bummer, but you're also talking about millions and millions of people, and who's going to-- So what cloud providers said, yeah, I got you? I don't know. Not Oracle. I'm sure you read the news the same way I do, and I see all these announcements, NVIDIA. they're giving OpenAI a hundred million, a hundred billion dollars, excuse me. You know, there's like, OpenAI's like, oh, I'm going to spend 300 billion with Oracle, and I'm going to spend a hundred billion with Google, and I'm like, like in Corweave and all, like all of this money, it feels like a gigantic game of musical chairs and somebody's going to be left without one to sit on, and I do worry it might be Microsoft. Like, what are we doing? We're just f***ing up, man.

[00:30:00.53] Parallels Desktop : You

[00:30:23.03] Jason Vallery :  Jason ValleryIt's an execution thing, though. Like, the problem is that the ideas have been there, right? We've had the ideas. It's actually turning them into reality and getting convicted about a path forward.

[00:30:34.15] Parallels Desktop : Yeah. I don't know if you can hear me, but I'm going to take a short break and we'll be right back.

[00:31:08.08] Jason Vallery :  Jason Vallery- Well, I mean, but okay, so to be focused, what can I do? Yeah, I mean, I've been doing the research side of this, like I said, I mean, I can give you more context. I had some meetings, you know, I don't know if you remember Glenn Lockwood, he's over at Bass now. So he was a good source of like, they're doing, what their strategy is, what should I go research? What do you want me to look at next? I kind of got a good sense on vast and core weave. What can I go learn for you? Or is there something else you want to take for...

[00:32:15.57] Parallels Desktop : You
