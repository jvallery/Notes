# 1:1 — Andy Pernstiner — 2025-10-30

> [!info] Purpose
> Build trust, surface and remove blockers, align on priorities, coach & grow.

## Summary

Alignment call on roles, gaps, and collaboration. Andy outlined his team’s four pillars (field escalation, lab/POCs, SE training/PM augmentation, marketing support) and major process gaps (docs, training, PRDs vs FRDs). Jason shared initial focus on making VAST on Cloud viable (marketplace objects, CSP shapes, multi-tenancy, SaaS, pricing). Discussed skepticism on current cloud economics, OpenAI’s multi-region data lake and GPU-adjacent model, and VAST’s opportunity as a global data plane. Agreed on immediate hands-on steps for Jason (OVA, SE lab, GitLab, phase gates/implementation reviews) and to improve PM-field collaboration. Noted ownership gap for Sync Engine and urgent need for Blob support for migrations (wave.ai).

## Key facts learned

- Andy’s team pillars: field escalation/POC support, lab management/benchmarks, SE enablement (training)/PM augmentation, marketing support.
- Docs today read like a “car stereo manual”; scenario guides are ad hoc and late.
- PM gaps: training ownership, PRDs (engineering writes FRDs), release visibility, access to builds/docs.
- Jason’s charter: make VAST on Cloud sellable; partner with Yonce on marketplace objects; push CSPs (start with Azure) for better shapes; drive multi-tenancy backlog (toward SaaS); align pricing/legal (with Timo).
- Current cloud fit is weak vs first-party capacity storage; value likely in higher-level compute + global data plane.
- OpenAI pattern: multi-exabyte lakes in 3 Azure regions (CPU/Spark/Databricks), GPUs in 50+ regions + CoreWeave + Oracle; use GPU-adjacent cache with checkpoints back to central.
- VAST opportunity: common data plane/global namespace across providers (“data spaces”).
- OVA is available (unsupported), requires ~128GB RAM host; networking to clients requires tunneling/proxies; one-VM multi-container demo only.
- SE Lab access via VPN and octo.selab.fastdata.com with an AD account; client VMs available; multiple clusters (GA/5.4), some tenant-admin only.
- GitLab (get.vastdata.com) access is restricted; IT ticket needed for a licensed account.
- Release hygiene: attend phase gates and implementation reviews (run by Galit/Orly); review Confluence release pages (e.g., 5.4 dev) and FRDs.
- SMEs: Multi-tenancy—Phil Wagstrom (primary), Ray Coetzee (UK).
- Biweekly Tomer–Octo/field sync exists; Jason added to OctoPM Monday sync.
- Sync Engine has no PM; Andy and Blake are acting PMs.
- wave.ai: ~100 PB in Azure Blob (Sweden); plan to migrate ~50 PB to CoreWeave and sync checkpoints back to Azure; needs Sync Engine to read from Blob.
- Aaron Zilber investigating Blob APIs (both to implement and to read for migration); he is OOO ~2.5 weeks.
- Andy owes sales an update on Sync Engine Blob support status today; customer needs early December start for migration.

## Outcomes

- Jason to get hands-on via OVA and SE Lab; request GitLab access.
- Jason to join phase gates and implementation reviews; review Confluence release/FRDs.
- Andy to add Jason to the biweekly Tomer–Octo/field sync.
- Plan a deep-dive on OpenAI architecture, workloads, and VAST fit.
- Jason to engage relevant SMEs (e.g., Phil Wagstrom) for multi-tenancy details.

## Decisions

- Use Phil Wagstrom as primary multi-tenancy SME contact.
- Proceed with OVA and SE Lab access for Jason’s learning.
- Schedule a follow-up focused on OpenAI architecture and needs.

## Risks

- Severe PM resource and process gaps (docs, training, PRDs, release visibility).
- VAST on Cloud economics may be uncompetitive vs first-party capacity storage.
- Implementation reviews occur late; docs for new releases not published on time.
- Restricted GitLab access impedes self-serve discovery.
- Yonce’s team integration/process is unclear (“black hole”).
- Sync Engine lacks clear PM ownership; urgent Blob-source support needed for migrations.
- Key engineer (Aaron Zilber) OOO while December migration timelines loom.

## Open questions

- What concrete cloud use cases make VAST on Cloud economically viable vs first-party storage?
- Which CSP shapes/pricing are required to achieve compelling perf/price in cloud?
- How many active VAST-on-cloud customers exist today and what are their use cases?
- Who formally owns product documentation and field training, and what’s the publication timeline?
- What is Yonce’s team process and how will it integrate with PM/engineering?
- Do we need to implement Azure Blob APIs on VAST for key workloads, or can we standardize on S3?
- Will the company invest in a properly staffed PM org with clear scope and accountability?
- Who is the 5.5 release manager and how can PMs ensure timely implementation reviews?
- What is the committed timeline for Sync Engine to support reading from Azure Blob for migrations?

[00:00:22.51]  Jason ValleryGood afternoon. Good afternoon to you sir. How's it going? It's good. How are you? Good. Thanks for making some time to me. I heard your name in a number of contexts and figured it would be good to just say hello and introduce myself.

[00:00:42.98]   RemoteMakes sense, I've heard your name too. - Where do you live?

[00:00:46.86]  Jason Vallery- Based out of Colorado, what about you?

[00:00:48.86]   Remote- Based out of Portland, right now I'm in Connecticut. I'm on my way to New York. Where in Colorado?

[00:00:57.46]  Jason Vallery- Living in a town called Longmont, just outside Boulder. Yeah, I grew up here.

[00:01:01.26]   Remote- Oh, cool.

[00:01:02.18]  Jason Vallery- Yeah.

[00:01:02.94]   Remote- Nice.

[00:01:04.28]  Jason Vallery- Cool. Field CTO, and it looks like you're kind of a long timer around here. Love to kind of hear from you, your role, your team, what you focus on, how we should work together, and if it's useful, I can give you a little bit of my background.

[00:01:22.00]   RemoteYeah. Let's see. So my role. being having been here for almost eight years it's like a part of it's been an evolutionary role part of it also is that just because I have so much history with people here I do things that are outside of whatever my role might be just because that's what happens right most of my time is meeting with identifying their use cases, trying to educate them on how we can solve for their use cases, and then managing a team of people who's focused on different subject areas to help make sure that we get the right level of understanding of what customers are trying to do, and then help them optimize how they use VaST. Part of that also results in refining how engineering builds some of the features that are built. There's basically, I would say there's four pillars, I guess you could call it, in terms of what we do. One is we are effectively a transactional backstop or an escalation point for the SEs. So all the field SEs. and field sales teams, if they need technical help or POC or a opportunity, generally for pre-sales, not for post-sales, they can engage with us and we will help them. That can range from helping them write POT test plans benchmarks to diagnosing issues with systems, to trying to educate customers on how to use a feature, educate the SEs on how to use features, doing demos that are showcasing new product offerings, lots of different things. We also manage a lab that the ISEs can use for doing their own demos. as well as one that they can use for running up posted POCs that are in the lab, and then we also use that same lab environment for running benchmarks for customers and testing out new product features and that kind of thing. Another area is training. So we are technically on the hook for enabling the SEs on how works. So when there's a new feature, I'm sorry, when there's a new release, like let's say 5.4 that just came out, generally I'll go through the list of major features and assign somebody from my team to develop the training for that feature. That means they have to engage with engineering as the features are developed and implemented and have to attend as many of the implementation reviews as possible. and then assemble training that can be consumed by SEs, and then part of that also means that we're spending a lot of time with engineering, which means that we have an unofficial kind of role, which is to act as a, I guess you could say, like a technical augmentation to the product management group. obviously there's not that many product managers here at Vast and there's too many things for them to do and so they don't necessarily get into all the technical details of every feature so that's kind of my team's job to to do that. The main distinction I would say between us and someone on the PM team today is that we probably know how to make the product do the thing that engineering says it does to the point. where we could deploy it at a customer site and troubleshoot if it wasn't working versus historically at least PM here has been good at explaining what a feature is supposed to do, maybe not to the point where they could do it for real or if they could they would only do it in a demo environment. But we have to be able to actually make it work on a POC or actually at a customer site so we have to know actually how it works, and then the last thing that we do a bit of is we support marketing efforts in terms of helping with webinars and blog posts and marketing videos of different types and sorts of nature. So there's a lot of different things that we do, but they kind of fall into one of those four categories.

[00:05:33.09]  Jason Vallery>> That's a broad swath of things, I think if you kind of the SWAT team, the technical SWAT team, right? You come in and solve these challenges and bring the knowledge and, you know, uplevel the conversation. Well, you know, so for me, I spent the first 10 years of my career as a software developer. So one of the things I value is deep technical skills in product management. I moved from software development, just getting my desires around communicating to customers and kind of getting a little bit more into the business side and business value at the dawn of the cloud. So this is super early days when cloud native principles were just emerging and design patterns. I joined Microsoft about 13 years ago at the dawn of Azure, so to speak, and quickly focused on object storage, and so, I spent almost all of my time at Microsoft in the product management team for object storage. I worked my way through that and owned all of it at some point, APIs, SDKs, tooling. tiering, basically you name it, pricing models, the whole deal. You know, 2018, 2019 or so, I got a phone call saying, hey, there's this customer called Opening Eye who's gonna get some capacity. We need somebody to work with them. One of the things my team was focused on is sort of real customer engagement. With the idea that product managers. deeply entrenched with the customers that are pushing the edges of the platform. You know, who's ever pushing the most e-transactions throughput, whatever is the gnarly problem of the day, that product managers should be sitting in those conversations to learn from it, and then there's also a business dimension because in a cloud world, product is also ultimately responsible for the P&L. the service. So I started working with OpenAI. I pivoted my focus within storage to be AI storage and my team was responsible for planning and delivering the platform that ultimately OpenAI runs on today, and I owned the storage relationship with OpenAI up until I left Microsoft, and that was my journey there. I joined Jeff's team. started last Monday and I'm super excited to kind of take Vast to the cloud and build out the right set of products. You know from a philosophy perspective you touched on this, you know in my mind there are really two kinds of product managers and ultimately even they're of a different title but there's the product managers like myself who come from a very technical hands-on background, the kind of folks that you really want to be able to swat team into a conversation, you know, not unlike your CTO team and be able to comprehensively and authoritatively speak on behalf of the product. You know, that's kind of the role I saw for myself and my team was you have these different levels of knowledge and escalation. But ultimately, when it gets to the product manager that owns a given feature, area, whatever, there should be a question that they can't answer, top of mind, and a set of recommendations that they can't make without some other escalation path, and there's the other side of product management.

[00:08:55.12]   Remote- I have never met a product manager who could go that deep. Maybe the world that you've been in is different. Like at Bass, I understand. We never really treated product management like a necessary function. So we just kind of like made them in glorified project managers, right? But even at other places that I've worked, like I would go to a product manager and, 'cause ultimately it's not just about what the customer perceives. about what the implementation details are like, because if a customer wants to deploy something, they'll ask, oh, can it interoperate with this service, or do I use this authorization model, or whatever. Those are things that I expect a product manager to know. But then there's lower level details that I would, if I was a customer, I would want to know. How are we sharding? What is currency look like all of the bits and pieces and like I haven't met any product manager to go that level. Are you saying that's what you would expect them to be able to do?

[00:09:52.96]  Jason ValleryI would say that, to finish my point, there are two types. There's the deep technical product manager and then the business value product marketing, go-to-market strategy, biz dev kind of product manager and how you align a product management is a balance of those two types of product managers, and I'm a product manager focused on a part of the stack or a specific feature area. Typically the way I would have aligned my team would be like, you're the guy that owns the REST API, and I would expect to put that guy into any meeting. with a customer and he could rattle off, you know, what HTTP headers do what on the API surface. Top of mind. So, you know, maybe the end-to-end story is fully nailed down, but they know the picture of the depth of the area of ownership they're responsible for, and then the really good ones are...

[00:10:50.12]   RemoteIn your estimation, so you only joined... like I guess a week ago, not even. Looking at the functional areas of the products, how much of a gap do we have between the number of product managers we have and the number that you think we would need to do it the right way?

[00:11:10.63]  Jason Vallery- Well, I mean, I'll tell you that in an engineering organization like Microsoft, it's a ratio, right? Because you get to organizations that are big enough, you manage their budget at that kind of level. Right? Microsoft has evolved here. - Right. - I would say, you know, when I first started at Microsoft, it was a seven to one ratio. For every seven devs, you had one product over. - Wow. - And then, some changes that actually happened in the last year and we're aligning to a 10 to one. So that's the typical.

[00:11:41.75]   Remote- Yeah.

[00:11:42.58]  Jason Vallery- And what you're talking about here is that, that one product.

[00:11:45.03]   Remote- What are we at, like 80 to one? I think we're at like 80 to one.

[00:11:47.73]  Jason Vallery- That's what I'm hearing, right? (laughing) You've got a product manager that's responsible for that DevPod, and actually if you compare and contrast Microsoft to AWS. you ask. Microsoft you know you roll through a product org and you roll through a dev org and then you have an all-up CVP who owns like a product and the PMs and the devs that one CVP. At Amazon it's matrixed in the sense that you have a dev manager who's responsible for his seven devs and his And then the PMs are matrixed up or product of them.

[00:12:26.29]   Remote- I see. Okay. Sorry to take us off that tangent. I just wanted to get a sense in your mind. Like, is I, I have some, actually there was a conversation that happened this morning between me and Jeff and Elone and Shahar. about roles and responsibilities. We see like big gaps in terms of what we're being able to fill right now, and there's areas where I feel like product management could or should own something where they're not, and part of it is they don't have enough staffing. Part of it is just our historical, I guess, Rennan's historical. I'll just tell you this, when I first started working here, they didn't know what job to give me 'cause it was the first person in the U.S. besides Renan was Jeff, and then after Jeff was me. There's basically nobody here, right? They didn't know what job to give me, and I'm like, I don't care, I'll just do whatever, and then we talked about product management, flat out, he's like, "I don't want to hire any product managers. They're not close enough to the customers. They're not close enough to engineering. They're not good at anything." But that was because he came from potentially an organization before at EMC, where he didn't really believe in the product manager's ability to do both of those things very well. So my team has kind of been gap-filling product management responsibility for the entire time we've existed. you a couple examples and you can tell me what your opinion is on it. First thing is documentation for the product. Currently it's being developed by engineering and it has huge gaps in terms of usability for customers and oftentimes my team support sometimes alone other people will gap fill like Ronan's team I don't know. I don't know if you've met with Ronan, who runs the solutions team in engineering yet. We were talking about his team today also. They end up doing a lot of the use case driven product solutions guides. Like, okay, you want to use VaST as a destination for backup data. How do you configure things? What are best practices, all that other stuff. But a lot of times, like, I feel like there's a, Like if the product documentation was like right now the way that I would I would tell you our product docs are Our product guides our product guides read like a car stereo manual, right? They tell you oh, there's a volume button If you turn it in this direction the volume goes up you turn it that direction the volume goes down They tell you what all the buttons do independently of each other They don't show you how to use the buttons to accomplish any kind of a goal, right? And so oftentimes my team has to go and write the docs to have customers actually use it. So now we have this whole shadow organization of documentation that is basically a gap-filling layer because of necessity, and it's always ad hoc, and it's always last minute, and it's always driven based on a customer requirement right now. right? It's not thought out in advance, not planned. That's one area. Another area is training the technical field. Like, you know, I've worked in a similar capacity at like three or four different companies now where my team is like a glue layer, but I find that like most of the organizations that I used to work at at. Product management would deliver the field level training. They would say here's a new feature, here's the target market for it, here's what it enables customers to do, here's the competitive analysis of it, here's how to use it, here are the nuances and caveats and that kind of thing. But we don't do that here. What we do is basically engineering... The other one is usually product management writes PRDs, right? They don't do that here. Engineering writes FRDs. The architecture team, so a soft levies team-- I don't know if you've met a soft. So a soft levies team is the architect team. They write the FRDs, but that's within engineering. They're writing requirements for their own engineering. team to build and so there's this huge gap there because Asaf isn't talking to every customer all the time. Like his team isn't always talking, they're talking to a select group of big customers for what they need and they're focused on the needs for that customer. So they write an FRD based on what they get out of those conversations. Usually my team goes in, reviews FRDs, reviews the implementation details but we're also being pulled into customer escalations for existing product issues, and so oftentimes we're doing this all ad hoc last minute and training suffers pretty badly because of it. Basically, I don't even know what's gonna be implemented until like maybe a month before release, and so it doesn't give us enough time to go and understand the feature well. enough to be able to create training in time so there's always this like race to release another good example is that the product documentation for 5.4 isn't even public yet as far as I can tell we review it and we're expected to train people on it but I can't point people to links on how to use it unless I write the docs myself so these are areas where I feel like product documentation, maybe it doesn't get owned by product management, but I feel like there needs to be a tighter loop between product management engineering on getting docs that are actually useful to customers, getting them on time, and then in terms of training the field, I think my team can definitely be involved in helping product management to deliver the training, but I don't like having the entire ownership of it. It's a huge time sink, at least for us. So I don't know what your thoughts, like how do you see this evolving?

[00:18:07.73]  Jason Vallery- Yeah, I mean, you're echoing a number of points I've heard from others, you know, now in my first week and a half, you know, I've been making the rounds, trying to do this myself and ask about product management at best, and I think I'm hearing the same sort Yeah, this for many folks, you know, so to touch on a few key points, um, you know, the way we would think about this, we'll start with documentation is the product manager does own documentation, but here's how that kind of comes together. Um, a product manager is assigned to specific scope, and so we would think about potential scope areas being. a part of the stack, like I mentioned earlier, maybe you own the API, or you own the tooling, or you own the tiering, whatever it is, right? They would be responsible for the, what I'll describe as sort of vertical documentation that you described in engineering rights today for their area. So like, here is the canonical REST API guide, or here's how you configure this feature, whatever. They're responsible for. right, and then there are horizontal PMs and industry PMs within the storage organization and they're scenario oriented, and so they would be, you know, the BCDR PM, and their goal would be to, I'm going to fully understand, you know, the BCDR workload as it relates to storage. I'm going to fully understand the AI workload as it relates to storage and maybe even further break they would be responsible for the end-to-end documentation of saying like here's how you configure this scenario, here's all of the features that come together to solve this problem and so they would be writing that part of it. They would also be responsible for the training and then together they would all coordinate with product head dedicated tech writers that would work through a common voice. in a common structure, so that it just didn't become a chaotic mess of wiki pages. So the tech writer is ultimately the one responsible for publishing it in partnership with the PM that either owns a vertical area or horizontal scenario or workload, and that's kind of how we think about documentation and training, and so on the training side, like-- Training was often focused on end-to-end scenarios, more so than features and functions, except when we talked about a new feature launch. You know, we'd go to a conference, the feature owner would be the one presenting that in a conference forum or an internal training setting. Whereas, you know, again, if it's a vertical, or sorry, a horizontal play or a scenario play, that PMT would work it, and then the scenario PMs, they would be also the folks responsible for a lot of the partnership with product marketing, with BizDev, like a lot of those sets of responsibilities, and so when I go back to my earlier points around, are we deep technical, like I want the feature owners to be deep technical, I want the scenario owners have more business savvy and be able to kind of go in and have customer conversations at a little bit more depth because they understand the workloads and be able to really have the sales relationships and sales play motions going. So all of that sat within the clock for us.

[00:21:16.28]   RemoteOkay. Sounds like a lot more people.

[00:21:23.04]  Jason ValleryThen we have but so we had yeah, it's a yeah, there's 95 people currently something like that

[00:21:30.38]   RemoteYeah, yeah, okay So I mean, I've only heard your name in reference to a few specific things so far. It's been mostly focused around some of this OpenAI related work that we want to get involved in doing. What area is the focus area for you currently?

[00:21:55.61]  Jason Vallery- Well, right now it's learning, and so going back to my technical roots, I've got to get my hands on VAST in a meaningful way. So I've got some follow-ups around that, but I really would love your guidance on the best way to get my hands on it. hands dirty. But more broadly, what is my ownership and what is Jeff asking me to take forward for the company? It is how do we get a vast on cloud offering that we can actually go sell and that delivers customer value, and so when I think about that, there's a bunch of things partnering with Yonce on getting marketplace objects launched, it's figuring out how we can. push on the hyperscalers with an initial focus on Azure to give us better shapes to provide performance-to-price ratios that actually make sense in the cloud. You know, one of the things I'm pushing Toma on right now is what are the backlog of multi-tenancy features that we need to work through to get to a point where we could potentially launch a SaaS offering. I'm thinking a lot partnering with Timo and others on like, what are the business models, pricing models, the legal ramifications of what we want to do in the cloud. So for me, it's end to end, how do I make Vast on the Cloud a thing that we can actually have some customer success.

[00:23:08.87]   Remote- Okay. Yeah, it's definitely an area where I'm, I have high amounts of skepticism. right now, only because I haven't yet, I haven't yet identified the set of use cases where the offering, both that we have, as well as the offering that might be right now planned, makes commercial sense for customers. In a lot of ways, because of the costs associated with, with deploying Vast on Cloud for a capacity footprint, like it's nowhere near competitive in terms of comparing that. You know, maybe, okay, if you want to compare it to let's say Elastifile or FSX Lustre and AWS, like maybe then there's some pricing advantage to Vast on Cloud. But compared to all the other first-party offerings that are focused on capacity. which would be Blobstore or it would be AWS S3 or GCS, like there's no fit, at least as far as I can tell. Maybe if we focus more on the higher level functions of the platform in terms of the compute services and some of the more advanced features, then it becomes interesting, but then we're competing against. against all of the first-party services like in Amazon, you have a whole array of services that we have alternatives for, but they aren't nearly at the place where they're mature enough or would have enough traction to make economic sense. Like, I don't even really know which customers are using us in the cloud right now. It's gotta be single digits as far as I can understand.

[00:24:45.57]  Jason ValleryThe market is even out there. Look, I see a lot of opportunity, but you're 100% right, what's there today doesn't solve it. Offload the object needs to be a thing, right? We need to be able to tear off to cloud native storage and grow capacity independent of the input. Ideally, we even get to the point of working with the CSPs to deploy like ODM hardware of use cases for that idea. But what I think the opportunity is, is that one of the clear things that was happening in Azure, and I'll assume this is happening across the CSPs, is that a lot of repatriation is real, and customers are kind of tired of cloud lock-in, and right now, the AI boom is causing the proliferation of the Neo clouds, the proliferation of compute following energy, such that you have to be able to bring the data to the compute, and that's the inverse of the cloud was built on. The cloud was built on this idea that data needed to be. brought to the cloud, and then you could spin your compute up and down and process it, that doesn't work anymore, and so the key thing that I think VaST brings and why I was so excited to come here is just being able to build a common data plane across hosting providers and a global namespace. So the idea that you can access your data from CoreWeave or Nebulous or Google Cloud and it's all one common data plane, like that's the future that I see being critical, and I think VAST is the furthest ahead in terms of what's available there. It's data spaces. Okay.

[00:26:28.67]   RemoteUm, okay, that sounds, I mean the story sounds good. Um, what opening, I mean we've been using the story.

[00:26:39.59]  Jason ValleryIt's what OpenAI needs. I mean that's the reality. Like, let me tell you real quick. OpenAI right now, they have three core Azure regions where they triplicate their important data assets, and these are all multi-exabyte data lakes, and those multi-exabyte data lakes do not have any GPUs adjacent to them. They're mostly CPUs, Spark pipelines, Databricks. A bunch of shit like that, all ingesting, processing, and storing into these data lakes, and then they have GPUs in 50-something Azure regions, plus CoreWeave, plus Oracle, plus who knows where else they're going to get them, and they use a GPU-adjacent storage as kind of like a cap, like they suck the important data out of the data lake, temporarily store it adjacent to the GPUs. process it, checkpoint local, bring the check back central. That vision is, I think, going to be more common, or that sort of scenario I think will become more common. OpenAI built their own global namespace to solve this problem.

[00:27:36.94]   Remote- Okay.

[00:27:41.25]  Jason ValleryInteresting.

[00:27:45.91]   RemoteYeah, okay, well, I mean that's a big, it's a big ambitious task, right, to get to that place. Yeah, I am interested to understand how we get there, I guess, and I have I don't have a hard stop. I've got to get on a train in 10 minutes, but I can still talk. So if you have a little time, we can keep talking.

[00:28:14.69]  Jason Vallery- Yeah, let me just double check. Yeah, I got another 30 minutes.

[00:28:19.12]   Remote- All right, so let's think about some practical things to do. I know you've probably met with like at least one, I think you might've met with Josh. he's on my team but you are going to meet with him. Yeah it's tomorrow morning. Have you? We're meeting tomorrow morning. Okay um and not that I need to control what you do and who you talk to but I'm curious what uh what aspects you're trying to speak with him about just so I get a sense

[00:28:48.90]  Jason ValleryAnd can give you a little understanding on things. I was selfishly stealing his gun. because I touched on this very briefly. If I want a copy of the OVA, like I want to go deploy a three node cluster here at my house, and I want to be able to get my hands dirty and just get, you know, find the pain points using the system. Like you said, like a good product manager in my mind better be able to use the product, and that's a gap for me so far.

[00:29:15.72]   RemoteSo what I'll say is the OVA basically it's a convenience thing and like we like the OVA was originally developed as part of the engineering dev test pipeline because they needed the ability to have one for their own purposes because we've been using both azure aws and and then also Oracle Cloud for running dev instances of clusters for the last several years. We decided to have a OVA to make it easier to package it. Also for potentially end user customers and partners have access to, but engineering doesn't really want to support it. gotten to the point where they'll support having a new build of the OVA released for every major release, although sometimes the pipeline still doesn't run and generate it, so we have to go and kick it. But basically, so if you need the OVA to be able to use in your own home lab, how about it? There's actually no real restriction on getting access to it. It used to be. that we wanted to gatekeep it a bit. So we go through an approval process. But now I just told Josh, I'm like, just auto approve everything, and in fact, I want to have them automate it so that SEs and other technical staff can just press a button and get a pre-signed URL downloaded along with the instructions and go have at it, right? So there's no restriction on it in terms of giving it to you or even to any customer. We just want to have a ticket created. to be able to track who has it just so that we know how much uptake there is on it and we know you know what versions are being used and that kind of thing. It's functional. There's some limitations on how it can be used. One of the biggest issues is that the networking is annoying to deal with so if you want to do any actual client access to the... to the to the data plane of the OVA there's some cargo culting crap you have to go through to create either SSH tunnels or proxies or whatever it's not terribly hard but you know it requires a little bit of hands and woven effort it you know you can spin up an OVA image on an ESX server you need to have enough on your host to do it, right? I think the minimum that you need is 128 gigabytes worth of memory on your server to be able to run it. It's basically an OVA image that you deploy and it spins up a virtual machine that has, I think it's four Docker containers that run in it. Each one of those represents some portion. of the cluster, like a couple C nodes, a couple D nodes, and it's all running in a single VM. You can't scale it. You can't add more VMs to make it bigger, at least not today. We don't really have intention on doing any of that unless there's a real demand, and so far we haven't officially supported it, so there hasn't been real demand. Customers typically use it so they can test API endpoints before they update. upgrade to a new release on their actual clusters, or if they want to sneak peek into features, and I know that like the database pipelines team, Ryan McGinty and Foad's team, they use it sometimes to enable partners for integration projects. Like if they want to test out Spark with fast and they would go and give them an OVA. Again, it's not really supported, but there's no restriction. gaining access to it and I think for certain things it'll definitely give you a flavor on how the product works but it's not really gonna give you the full experience. The other options that are available to you we can treat you like an SE. The way we would do it is, do you have access to the VPN? - Yeah. - Okay, so you have VPN access, which means there's a portal that we manage. You go to, if you open a web browser to octo.selab.fastdata.com. If you're on the VPN, there'll be a portal. Now, the only requirement to using it is that you request a SCLAB Active Directory account by filing it. There's like a form to fill out, it generates a ticket, we automatically create a user and send you credentials, then you have access to certain lab resources, you'll also have access using your JumpCloud. credentials to be able to create virtual machines in the SE lab. Virtual machines meaning like client machines not like OVA image deployments where you can go and have like a Linux client or a Windows client so you can use that to access one of the lab clusters. We also manage we manage several different racks of hardware in the data center in Phoenix. One of those racks is like the SE Lab sandbox rack, which is what you'd have access to, where there's four clusters in that rack. Each one of them is running current GA or maybe 5.4. Most of them you have full unfettered access to do whatever you want to, which means that they are not necessarily stable clusters stuff. There's also one cluster that we're experimenting with where you don't get full cluster admin rights, you only get tenant admin level rights so that that way in case someone breaks something we just have to blow the tent away and recreate it and then we're okay. We're actually gonna lean more heavily on that to keep a more stable environment going and in particular if you want to start using the data engine to generate pipelines and functions and stuff we're gonna be releasing a doc probably this week or next to all the SEs because we created a multi-tenant system in the SE lab where they can log in as their domain credentials and be able to create pipelines and functions on their own without having to go provision Kubernetes and do all the other stuff required right we've done all that in advance so depending on what you're trying to do You can use the OVA if you want your own personal sandbox. If you want to log into a real live cluster, there's several clusters you can log into, and so that's probably the best way for you to get started is to just go and poke around in the lab. You know, if you, that portal that I pointed you to, if you don't have a login for it, there's a button you can click on to request a login. you can browse resources that are available there and be able to kind of be self-service in most ways. So I would say do that, and then if you need more than what you can get through that, then we probably want you to file a ticket with us explaining what you need, and then we can figure out the right way to accommodate it to accommodate specialized lab environments for SEs to run customer POCs in, or partner integration POCs. So John Mao runs the alliances team, and there's some technical people within his organization who are doing like more deeper technical integration work with technology partners. So sometimes we carve off attendance or carve off a cluster for them. use for a period of time where we can actually give partners and end customers VPN access into a firewalled off portion of the lab. So that's that's that's another thing but you know you

[00:36:35.59]  Jason ValleryMay not need that right away but you might at some point in time. I mean I've got a beefy box I can and I'll probably just spin up the OVA here because you know the ideal is I can move data around and play with it and try to use it for something semi-real that's you know valid. Yeah I think

[00:36:58.09]   RemoteThe hard I think the thing you're going to have the hardest time with besides that the VM is relatively small you can't put a lot of data into it but you know probably for your purpose. it doesn't matter as much. The hardest time you're gonna have is you spin the OVA up, and then if you wanna have another VM access using S3, using NFS, using SMB, it's a little bit of a process to be able to set that up, but it's not impossible, and creative people know how to do it. But you know again like sometimes learning means tripping over shit along the way until you figure out what to do, right? Yeah, so yeah, how about it? There's nothing blocking you from doing it just you know click through to get it get an account set up and then you should be able to actually click a button to request an OVA and I think right now it still generates a ticket and then we'll send you the link. But usually, we turn that around in less than a day, we'll send you a pre-signed URL. So it's pretty easy.

[00:38:01.82]  Jason Vallery>> I don't know how much time I'll have to play with it in the short term but it's definitely on my list of things to get done. So I'll get after it.

[00:38:07.74]   Remote>> Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. Then since if you are more technical, then make sure you have a GitLab. accounts that actually has access to the source tree. Not because you should read all the code, but sometimes to read some of the docs that aren't available yet, or to be able to check to see if there's something in a release or not. Sometimes it's good to have access to the code base. Also because a lot of people are putting things like demos and scripts and tools, they're putting it in different repos in GitLab, and unless you have an actual licensed GitLab account, you're not gonna have access to most of it, and there has been clamped down in terms of non-engineering staff having GitLab access over the last year, where most SEs don't have it anymore. to like push to get that if you don't have it already, and the way you would know is if you go to get.vastdata.com and if you are not able to use your Google workspace credentials to log into that, that means that you don't have it enabled on your profile. So you would just need to file an IT ticket to get it and if you need approval for that, I'll... I can approve it, Jeff can approve it, anybody can approve it who has like some authority, but by default you might not have it, right?

[00:39:31.56]  Jason ValleryI'm sure I don't. I find I don't have anything yet, so everything I'm asking is a problem.

[00:39:36.68]   RemoteYeah, probably. I've got to fight for my team even to have access to it, so it's one of those things that happens all the time.

[00:39:42.96]  Jason ValleryYeah, it makes sense.

[00:39:45.92]   Remote- Yeah, yeah, yeah. The other one is that, you know, try and get your, try and get your, would be good for you to interact with the product release team in terms of getting on the phase gates. Do you know what that means?

[00:40:04.91]  Jason Vallery- Yeah, I met with Ms. Ross yesterday, yeah. uh and yeah yeah yesterday and i think i've got the invites now so yeah the other one the other

[00:40:16.21]   RemoteOne so the phase gate process is usually just kind of like every you know we have milestones where we you know you go and talk about the status of the release as well as which features are getting pulled in or getting pushed out to a different release those are important so you can get a to be in and out, but if you want to get the actual technical detail, the right mechanism is to attend the implementation reviews, and I believe that it's either GALIT, it's G-A-L-I-T, or it's ORLY, her name is O-R-L-Y, they run the implementation reviews. in conjunction with whoever the release manager is for a particular release. So 5.5 has a specific release manager, I forget who it is. But I mentioned the implementation reviews because that's when the team lead for a specific feature and there will be, so implementation review wise, so in 5.5, as we get closer to release, there will be an implementation review for each of the major features, and the way that it works usually is that the FRD is reviewed by the architect in charge of the feature, and then the team lead and QA lead for that feature will present a demo of the feature to the rest of the engineering leadership and technical review team. I try to get my team to attend as many as possible. The hard time is a lot of times it's based in Israeli time zones. So the harder for my West Coast people to join those. Those are usually recorded. So another thing is to find the recordings of the ones for 5.4. You'll probably learn a fair amount about our process or lack thereof, as well as what some of the discussions are during the implementation phase, and they unfortunately don't happen until very late. the process, right? Like you would think that they would happen like a month or two before beta, but oftentimes they get slipped out because no one has time and they happen like a week or two before actual release, but that's where I gain the most amount of knowledge about how a feature actually works outside of going to Israel and sitting with a team for a whole week or two to try and figure out what they're doing, right? Okay.

[00:42:23.38]  Jason ValleryThat's all super helpful.

[00:42:26.06]   RemoteAnd generally speaking, there is a-- so every release has a page in Confluence. So there's a couple of pages, but there's ones that are of particular interest that there's-- like, if you go into Confluence, you type into the search box, you type in 5.4. and then you look through the initial results. There's one called 5.4 dev, for example, they always name it this way, and then you'll see what the hierarchy looks like once you click on it, but it'll be a list of all the features that are in the release with a table of who the team lead is in QA, the team lead is in engineering, the architect is in engineering, the field owner is from my team, manager when there's one assigned it'll have a link to the FRD for each of the features and then the and so then you can look through the FRD to understand what the scope of the feature is. We've done quite a bit of iteration the last couple of releases to force engineering to make sure that whatever's in the FRD at the time we go to release is actually what is implemented. just what they wanted to implement, right? Because I can't tell you how many times I'll look at an FRD in the past and then go ask engineering what was implemented, and then half the things in there aren't implemented, right? So we've gotten better, but it still isn't perfect. But you'll learn a lot going through that kind of stuff. That's how we usually start to develop training. We go through we go to the implementation review, we then sync with the team leads, and then we can develop documentation and training based on what we learned, and then the last piece is, as releases start to come, you may wanna pick items where you wanna be a doc reviewer for the engineering docs, because in historic, have had to fight a bit to get the right people assigned to those, but then you actually get to see what engineering is producing in terms of docs, leave comments, suggestions, help them

[00:44:24.90]  Jason ValleryRewrite things because they need a lot of help. Yeah, I mean, I think what I'm focused on initially is, and I've been talking about this with Tomer, is given the scope that I own, I want to get the backlog of what the platform gaps are today to get to the multi-vision that I have, and so I think that turns into a set of things that I want to prioritize for upcoming releases, and so right now my focus is reading through and understanding what's there and what the gaps are, and that's where my technical learning comes in. So you know, helpful for me to be able to go through some of the release notes and figure what we've shipped, frankly, and how that works in the multi-tenant world. It's kind of my current focus of knowledge that I want to gain.

[00:45:10.92]   RemoteYeah, that makes sense. The other thing is, since the introduction of Yancey's team into the organization, I don't know how his. team tracks their progress. I don't know how they integrate into the overall framework. It's a black hole for me right now. So I haven't really been focused on it.

[00:45:32.50]  Jason ValleryYeah, I mean, that's, he's my partner in crime here, and yeah, you know, week one, so we don't have a process figured out yet. But I think that's the right thing for my team to own. I don't know what that'll look like. But yeah,

[00:45:45.95]   RemoteI suppose at some point you're going to meet with customers and that sort of thing. We're going to publish a matrix of sorts, which identifies subject matter experts across different parts of the organization, whether it be engineering, whether it be my team. whether it be people in other field teams who are specialists on specific subject areas of the product. So I have someone assigned to being the kind of main person for S3, for example. I have someone who's assigned for multi-tenancy, for example. Those are people who are really deeply technical. and who understand the nuances of the product and how it works and so uh I don't know where that table is. I think Alon was trying to yeah finish assembling it today. I've got it up right

[00:46:42.32]  Jason ValleryNow that's what I just pulled up um yeah the R&R yeah he shared that with me. Okay cool cool yeah

[00:46:50.15]   Remoteso that's a good way for you to know if you want to have better. understanding on how a feature works, you can talk to engineering. From my standpoint though, a lot of times you might get better information out of the people on my team about a subject area only because we're the ones who are actually having to figure out how to implement it for customers, and so you might get better mileage out of engaging with them if you have a question about how something does work and about some of the challenges. they've had and like making it work for customers.

[00:47:20.01]  Jason Vallery- Okay, that's helpful. Yeah, this says Ray Coetzee is the guy to talk to about multi-tenancy, does that sound right?

[00:47:28.45]   Remote- Say it one more time.

[00:47:29.34]  Jason Vallery- Ray Coetzee, I'm not sure if I'm saying it right.

[00:47:32.03]   Remote- Okay, so Ray Coetzee is good. He's based out of the UK. He's very technical. If you want to know more, honestly, the multi-tenancy would probably be Philip Wagstrom, who's on my team. Because he's the one who understands all the hierarchy and layouts of how tenants map to clusters, map to administration, map to all the different functional areas, and so, you know, Ray is good. I would say Phil Wagstrom. is probably more attuned to being a subject matter expert for that, so.

[00:48:07.85]  Jason Vallery- Okay.

[00:48:10.00]   Remote- Hang on a second, I gotta.

[00:48:11.90]  Jason Vallery- No worries.

[00:48:13.48]   Remote- Hang on a second, give me one second.

[00:48:15.58]  Jason Vallery- No worries.

[00:48:45.99]   Remote(clicking) (computer chimes) (bell chimes)

[00:50:16.02]  Jason ValleryOkay, so, kind of good advice, kind of distill all these notes down, I think I've got good learning as next steps, maybe we've got 10 minutes. I mean, what I would love to hear from you is how best to collaborate between PM and your team and, you know, what can I do for you?

[00:50:48.52]   RemoteWe do have a biweekly sync with Tomer's group and my team to discuss whatever hot topics come up. A lot of times it's a fair amount of level setting between. of what the, 'cause there's a bi-weekly go-to-market call that also happens, where typically there's high-level sales-oriented messaging given to the field about the product, and then we usually have to do some level of demystification in terms of, here's what marketing said, but here's what reality is, and there's a lot of nuts and bolts logistics. It's kind of a bitch fest between us so that we have somewhere we can grumble about the process and engineering and what marketing is kind of positioning. But it can help to help understand what projects are in flight, and then it helps my team know what's coming from PM. But oftentimes. you'll find that organically me and my team will know more about what engineering is working on than sometimes the PMs do about what engineering is working on. So it's a process gap obviously, but we need to make sure there is a way to gap fill it a little bit because there isn't a good forum for it otherwise. So I'll try and make sure you're added to that.

[00:52:08.55]  Jason ValleryYou're on the email distribution list for the PM team. I got added to the OctoPM sync that's on Monday. So do you have that on my calendar now? Well then let me just read a question like how do you and I work together to up-level PM at best? One piece at a time.

[00:52:40.55]   RemoteI think that there's a lot of process gaps, and we probably want to focus on the ones that are the most impactful first, I mentioned a few of them related both the training and docs, field readiness being kind of the overarching theme there, and so to me, I think that-- sure to help like I want to find a way to hold the product release team and engineering accountable to making sure that we get access to the docs to the people and to the you know beta builds if that's what it is and in a more process oriented way because right now if I want to get a build a basic send a slack message till the raw is at midnight or whatever and then she'll send me a build right that's not a process um and so i want to find the right mechanism so that we all have one place we can go we can get the information we want without having to go and hunt down every random person who might know that's kind of the that's that is a huge time sink for us right now.

[00:53:41.02]  Jason Vallery- Yeah, I mean, it's about named owners and, you know, going back to my earlier point of really giving clear scope and accountability to a product owner. I mean, it doesn't feel like the way things run around here. So...

[00:53:52.31]   Remote- Not at all.

[00:53:54.21]  Jason Vallery- Yeah. Well, there's a resource.

[00:53:56.48]   Remote- Yeah, I'm happy to help with that, however I can, for sure.

[00:53:59.23]  Jason Vallery- I think the resource and challenging will be the... the initial problem. I mean, Telmarine's teams, there's not a lot there, and yeah, it's hard to

[00:54:06.92]   RemoteYou know where we're at. But yeah, I think the other way to, I mean, everything for us ends up coming down to customers, right? Nothing moves unless there's a big enough customer helping to move it yeah and so uh you know the other the other one and just probably doesn't fall under your remit, but I'll give you an example, which is we have a kind of side product, which is called Sync Engine. You heard of that?

[00:54:33.41]  Jason Vallery- Yeah.

[00:54:34.09]   Remote- There is no product manager for that. Right now, I'm acting product manager, and then Blake, who's also on my team, is acting product manager, and so I think we need to find the right way. way to integrate that into some product management framework. So, I don't know exactly what the right way to do that is, but it's an example of a brand new product that, in theory, if we did it right, we could align to the right process. But I can already see that it's off to a start where it's doing the organic thing. Right And so, I mean, again, I don't know if that falls into your world, but.

[00:55:15.88]  Jason Vallery>> I don't know what my world is fully at this point. Yeah, I mean, I guess the conversation to have with Jeff and really just get, where do we go with product management here? Is it a, are we going to take product management seriously and try to build structure and rigor and process? across the product stack or is it like a support function? 'Cause that's kind of how it seems to be treated at the moment. At least I get the sense.

[00:55:40.15]   Remote- Yeah.

[00:55:40.98]  Jason Vallery- He's not like in the driver's seat on a lot of things, so.

[00:55:44.47]   Remote- Definitely not, definitely not. But yeah, so I think we'll start, get your hands dirty a little bit with the product. product. You know, obviously since you're focused on the sort of cloud deployment area of things, then that'll naturally be the place that you spend most of your time I don't really have anyone my team focused on that and the things I mean Josh kind of only use, like anytime an SE wants to help, you know, get help setting up. GCP or AWS instances for testing, he's usually the one to help facilitate that, but that is just because he knows how to do it, not because of any other reason, right? So, but basically I'm saying I don't have a, I don't have somebody who's the expert on fast on cloud, for example, I don't have that.

[00:56:38.63]  Jason VallerySense. Okay, well I heard about Scyther calling me. Any other things we should chat about before I drop?

[00:56:46.07]   RemoteNah, sure there's plenty, but well actually, I mean I've heard lots of rumbling about the whole OpenAI thing, but I don't know where to go with that one. I just know that we're all all kind of pending on a bunch of stuff to be done, like tests, if that is. Like we're waiting on OpenAI, we're waiting on 4Weave, we're waiting on a bunch of things to happen. I'd want to be involved in it to some extent just because the revenue side could be potentially pretty explosive, but I'm pretty disconnected from it other than trying to help. Like I wrote a test plan for OpenAI to use. They're going to test in 4Weave. But it was just based on trying to get a test plan out the door, it wasn't really a holistic thing.

[00:57:27.64]  Jason ValleryYeah. I mean, what I could do, and maybe this would be a useful follow-up conversation, is kind of walk you through their pain points and their architecture. You know, I know the platform, I know the way they deploy today, I know the end-to-end data flow, their pipelines, the workload, the scenarios. and where VAST fits into the picture. What I can say is like, it's not it keeped on anything that we can unblock at the moment. They're going through a lot of organizational evolution and some of the key storage people at OpenAI just got pushed out. That team's getting re-org'd over there. I think there's a very, very clear opportunity. for VAST at OpenAI or I honestly probably wouldn't have wanted to come over to this role because I know like that scenario is the key one for me and you know the opportunity and Brennan's incenting me on OpenAI and so I think we really do have a good opportunity there but it's not happening soon. Sorry yeah it's - Yeah, it's staged. Is that your, oh, I see. That was your ticket to your taker.

[00:58:39.81]   Remote- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I had to deal with that. Okay, yeah, no, I would love to go through that. I was talking to Leo Stone the other day when I was in London, 'cause he had just gotten off the phone with you and talked me through some of this stuff. I talked to Alon for a bit when he was in London also. So yeah, I'm definitely interested in understanding their overall architecture that we can figure out where can relieve pain and give them, you know, what they're after. Obviously with the smallest scope possible, but you know, it's a big enough opportunity that.

[00:59:16.35]  Jason ValleryThe scope will get bigger. I mean, here's the high level before I drop, you know, they just in the last couple of days, the press was there, the contract structure with Microsoft changed, and now the first right of refusal is no longer with Microsoft, and they are very actively, you know, exploring alternative cloud devices. I think they're going to build their own data centers and to my earlier kind of comment around data spaces and global data things, but like they're going to need a common data platform across all of those different providers. They need one single data storage solution, and so they're, they're very seriously looking at how do they move a bunch of this stuff off of blob. we were the obvious choice. I don't know who else they would consider.

[01:00:06.23]   RemoteNow do you think that means we have to support the Bob APIs or does that

[01:00:09.75]  Jason ValleryMean that they would port to S3? I think that is a workload by workload conversation and there are several workloads at OpenAI and I would, you know, we would have to kind of tackle that beast as we go. I don't see it as a hard criteria, but it is probably something that eases friction. Then there's other reasons why I think a Blob API are interesting, just for the overall marketplace in Azure. I think there's goodness for us to do a Blob API, but I don't think it is on the critical path.

[01:00:41.18]   Remote>> The other one to write down and talk about with me later is wave.ai. who is about to be a relatively large customer inside of CoreWeave, but they have 100 petabytes sitting in Azure Blob in Sweden, and part of my project is to help them migrate 50 petabytes of that to CoreWeave, and then also to have their checkpoints automatically sync back into Azure Blob to allow them to train both in CoreWeave as well as in Azure, if they run jobs and they want to resume them elsewhere, right? So I've come up with a little bit of a strategy, but I would like to talk it through with you to make sure that it doesn't conflict with any of the stuff you're

[01:01:25.83]  Jason ValleryWorking on with Beyoncé. Yeah, I mean, maybe one of the things we should do is a bit of a... knowledge sharing around blob, you know, I've got all of the comments and knowledge around that so you know we should, I don't know if it's broader than you and your team but like who I should bring down some of the, you know, edges of the system, how it works like what should so yeah so the person, the person on the engineering architecture side is focused on it is Aaron Zilber.

[01:02:01.92]   RemoteBut he unfortunately is on vacation the next two and a half weeks. He's in the midst, like for the OpenAI project, he was investigating the Blob APIs in case we wanted to implement Blob on top of our platform. But then he was also conversely investigating Blob APIs because in order for us to migrate 50 petabytes out of it. of Azure, we need to extend Sync Engine to be able to support reading from LOB, and so that's like a hot topic right now because we have to deliver something to the customer in early December so they can start migrating data, and so there's like, there's a pretty fast track there in terms of extending Sync Engine to do that, and like, I owe the sales team an update on where we're at with that.

[01:02:38.85]  Jason ValleryToday. Okay well yeah happy to dive into all those things I gotta bounce but yeah let's find more time to talk and go through those in detail in a moment. Awesome really great meeting you man.

[01:02:51.62]   RemoteWelcome aboard yeah had a great one. Thank you very much.INAUDIBLE
