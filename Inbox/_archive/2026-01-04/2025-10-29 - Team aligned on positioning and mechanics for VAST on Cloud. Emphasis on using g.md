# 20251029 0905 Parallels Transcription

**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Participants:** Lior, Tiffany Stonehill, Olivia, Jason Vallery, Paul, Arik Kishner, Director Hampson, Beth, Madhu

## Summary

Team aligned on positioning and mechanics for VAST on Cloud. Emphasis on using global namespace to place data where compute lives (on‑prem, public cloud, cross‑cloud, and Neo clouds). Current VM shape/cost constraints limit very large cloud-only footprints; near-term roadmap includes marketplace automation, larger VM shapes with hyperscalers, and leveraging cloud object storage for cost. Field asked to route opportunities via Slack and Salesforce; several customer scenarios discussed (NYSE/ICE, Visa scale copy, genomics POC), and a follow-up is needed on tenant-level peering for multi-tenant clusters.

## Key facts learned

- Tiffany covers AWS and Azure; Olivia covers GCP and OCI.
- Jason Vallery joined as VP of Product Management for Cloud; 13 years leading Microsoft object storage PM.
- Global namespace is the key differentiator to move data to where compute resides (on‑prem, cloud, cross‑cloud, Neo clouds).
- Initial supported AWS VM shapes are 120 TB nodes; Azure currently ~23 TB nodes with discussions for ~300 TB nodes next year.
- Current cloud VM cost is ~$0.20/GB-month, roughly 20x on‑prem hardware costs.
- Large-scale cloud competitiveness will come from integrating cloud object storage (e.g., S3) in future releases.
- MVP is an 8‑node HA VAST cluster running on cloud VMs; same product as on‑prem, optimized for ease of deploy and performance.
- Marketplace automation to deploy clusters in customer tenants: GCP first, Azure and AWS targeted within ~3 months.
- Proof-of-concept sponsorship is commonly available via cloud providers; VAST cloud spend also burns down customer cloud commits.
- AWS FSx first‑party program is being pursued; more field opportunities accelerate hyperscaler support (VM shapes, programs).
- Cloud team has grown from ~5 to ~25 engineers; velocity is increasing.
- NYSE/ICE explored cloud burst to AWS but chose VAST on‑prem after cost/complexity analysis—still a VAST win.
- Visa seeks ~20 PB copy in AWS; needs higher scalability and better TCO than current shapes allow.
- SyncEngine is being considered to bridge current gaps for moving data in/out of cloud object storage.
- Collateral (positioning, battle cards, talk tracks) is in progress; Supercomputing will feature demos and materials.

## Outcomes

- Field to submit cloud opportunities via Salesforce and the dedicated Slack channel for rapid support.
- Arik and Lior to continue the Visa scale discussion offline.
- Madhu to follow up on the AWS genomics use case for potential POC/marketplace path.
- Jason to be added to the VAST on Cloud Slack channel.
- Lior to return with a roadmap answer on tenant-level peering for multi-tenant clusters.
- Team to push hyperscalers for larger VM shapes and programmatic support (e.g., AWS FSx).
- Collateral and demos to be ready for Supercomputing; SE training deck planned before SE.

## Decisions

- Use the VAST on Cloud Slack channel as the primary intake for opportunities; Tiffany (AWS/Azure) and Olivia (GCP/OCI) will lead engagement.
- Proceed with the MVP 8‑node VAST on Cloud clusters via marketplace automation (GCP first, Azure/AWS to follow).
- Actively pursue hyperscaler programs (e.g., AWS FSx) and larger VM shapes to improve cost/performance.

## Risks

- Current VM shapes and pricing make multi‑PB cloud deployments expensive versus on‑prem.
- Tenant-level peering limitations hinder multi-tenant Neo cloud to public cloud data movement.
- Object storage integration for lower TCO is not in the initial GA, impacting large-scale viability.
- Customer expectations for 10–20+ PB footprints require clear roadmap and cost guidance.
- Collateral is still being finalized; field may lack standardized assets until Supercomputing.
- Dependence on hyperscaler roadmap and programs introduces schedule and capability uncertainty.

## Open questions

- What is the timeline for tenant-level peering support from a multi-tenant VAST cluster to multiple customer-owned cloud clusters?
- When will cloud object storage integration (e.g., S3) land to materially improve cost at large scale?
- What are the exact GA dates and procurement steps for marketplace transactions on GCP, Azure, and AWS?
- What architecture can meet Visa’s ~20 PB cloud copy requirement with better TCO and scalability?
- What is the expected timing and path for AWS FSx first‑party support?
- What is the concrete timeline and scope for OCI support tied to the Zoom project?

[00:00:00.04]   Remoteor here to support in any way we can. So for those of you, I haven't met, I just wanted to introduce myself. Thank you. Any of you guys? Oh, go ahead, Lior. - No, no, maybe Tiffany, maybe go and do this. same just so they will get to understand who you are and what's you know which yeah absolutely tiffany stonehill i know i haven't met everyone um i've been with vast for just over a year and a half and originally took on um oci but now i am covering azure and aws so similar to olivia only the other two hyperscalers um additionally will be in sc as well and covering Ignite so likewise echoing that same message if there's you know any of your current customers are currently in AWS or Azure which I know a lot are this is an exciting time for for VAS because we now have a complete offering in the cloud or almost there but with all of them but yeah just want to start having those conversations early on so we can start aligning the right resources and having the right talk track. So I look forward to working with all of you. - Additionally, Tiffany and I, and Lior of course, have been working with product marketing internally. So some vast sellers I've spoken to have talked about, positioning or battle cards or talk tracks to make you know when your customers bring up vast on cloud to make those discussions easier so we're trying to finalize a lot of those assets as soon as they are finalized they'll they'll be pushed out to you but in the meantime the best the best route is to one of us in. So Tiffany covers AWS and Azure and I'm covering GCP and OCI just just to clarify that. Paul, I see your question. What about moving workloads off the cloud back into the data center? Does that mean moving off the cloud back to on-prem, or are you talking about a hybrid model? Can you expand on that a little bit? A little bit of both. Just one of the customers I'm talking to right now is exploring the idea of moving most of their stuff off of GCP, and they're looking at bringing it back into the data center, and so, I'm very new to VAST. I've been here, this is month four. I think we might have been in the same, I recognize your logo, we might have been in the same, what do you call it, Vast or Vasternauts? Vasternaut school, sure. Yeah. Okay. a little bit better if Vast on cloud makes sense for someone that's an existing GCP customer, you know, maybe using some of the features of the technology to stretch back down into a cluster that we were hopefully going to be building for them in their own data center. So I'm just throwing it out there as a way to try and move some product. for you. So this is really the way it does work, right. You know, the opportunities we've been engineering the past year for the product was ready to launch is you speak with the customer, you talk about what's the form of possibilities on cloud, and at the same time you really promote VAST for what VAST can do, and VAST can do a lot on service, and it ends up that a lot of this or giving customers ideas of how they can deploy more on-prem. A win for us is if the customer decides to go with BUST. So you are talking about something that is actually happening in the field. A good example is ICE, which is New York Stock Exchange. We ran a process for the past two months supporting them. They looked at having an on-prem burst into AWS and they did the testing they did everything but they also looked at pricing and they also looked at complexity and they get to go to exposure to what Vaas can do on-prem and it seems I don't want to jinx it it seems that they made a decision to go with Vaas but to go with Vaas on-prem so engaging with us it's just showing the customer that our offering does doesn't stop on-prem. We also offer burst into cloud and cloud offering, which means that we can compete with anyone, and then the outcome might be that they will decide to stay on-prem or move stuff on-prem. So you really can't lose.

[00:04:45.95]  Jason Vallery- And maybe this is a good opportunity, Lior, for me to introduce myself to the team.

[00:04:49.87]   Remote- Jason is on the call.

[00:04:52.58]  Jason ValleryI didn't know that it was on the Kool-Aid, I apologize, please meet Jason. Let me introduce myself to the team, and I have a lot of thoughts on this topic, actually. So, Jason Veller, I joined BAST about a week ago, so I'm very, very new and still drinking from the Kool-Aid. But the role I've taken on is VP of Product Management for the cloud, reporting to Jeff, and I'll tell you, the experience I bring is I came from Microsoft, running product management for Microsoft's object storage platform for the last 13 years and in various roles in that team, and what I see as the key differentiator that BAST has is the data space's global namespace, and so when I think about our cloud opportunity, it really is to enable customers to bring their data to where their compute's at. So if that is taking data from the cloud and bringing it on-prem or from on-prem and bringing it to the cloud, across clouds, to the Neo cloud, that is the killer advantage that VaST has in its current capability set that we need to exploit to win the cloud. It's a certain area that I see us investing heavily in and scenarios that we'll want to push with our customers and with the field. A lot to do here, but that's the direction I want to take.

[00:06:00.12]   Remoteus. To echo off that, I think, like Lior said as well, this is really to open up conversations with your customers. You know, customers want to decide where their data lives and where their compute runs, so this is a way for them not to be locked into one model. this is a way that your customers now have access to DAST on cloud. So this should bring a lot more business to you and open up the conversation with your customers a lot more. - Yeah, hey, Olivia, Lair. Yeah, I have Visa as my account, and I think you're aware of what's going on there. They're not looking to burst to cloud, but they would like to have sort of a full copy of the data set in the cloud, mainly on AWS, and we ran into limitations. They were looking at about 20 petabytes of total. capacity if not more. My question is are our limits getting any any better or is there a newer architecture that can that can lower the overall total cost but also provide higher scalability. It can be multiple clusters but it can't be like. You know. Three or four bit of a cluster. Every time, so first of, every time we have an opportunity for tens of petabytes, that's, it triggers the conversation by itself, right? So let's, again, Arik Kishner, let's talk about it after the call, but I think what you've touched is the fact that we're seeing bursts. The reason why we're seeing bursts, it's the initial offering on cloud, this is an internal call, right? And if you look at AWS, the VMs that we are supporting today are 120 terabyte VMs, and to build 10 or 20 petabytes today, it's a big cluster. But more than that, it's an expensive cluster. Because these VMs are roughly around 20 cents a gigabyte a month. Again, for the sake of the team on the call, if you compare the cost of these VMs, which is hardware, to on-prem, it's about 20 times more expensive. Now, being less expensive on cloud is by using object storage on cloud. In Amazon, example, Amazon S3. So Jason joining, and a lot of conversations are happening in the background of how do we get to utilize cloud object storage as a part of our storage solution on cloud. to make the pricing more competitive. This isn't coming with the initial release, which is right now. It will come with future releases. So a project at that scale needs to be a conversation with JSON, needs to be a conversation about roadmap, and needs to be a conversation about expectation setting. But if you imagine Python... to five six at that point in time we'll get to a point that we we can compete at that scale and we can compete with the right price and the right price performance yeah but ari krishna let's take it offline and let's talk about the details we have a few opportunities right now and which So four to 400 petabytes opportunity, and the conversation that we had earlier on this call was mostly about the burst and we're trying to get you guys to think about tell your customers that they can, back to JSON, they can move the data to where resources are, and that's really cool if they want to use CPU or GPUs on cloud. When somebody is looking at multi petabyte deployment, not just for burst, we need to understand that. a conversation and we need to figure out how to address it and we have ways to address it even today.

[00:09:51.02]  Jason ValleryYeah, I'll just echo what Lior said. In order to be successful in the cloud, we have to push the hyperscalers to give us better shapes of VMs that allow us to be more cost effective combined with platform improvements and innovations that will allow us to leverage cloud primitives and then really our product in such a way that can span those environments. So we have a lot of work to do here. We have a lot of pressure we have to put on the cloud providers, you know, but that's why I'm here.

[00:10:16.96]   Remote- Great, thank you. - Yeah, that work is an example with Microsoft. It wasn't even shared with Microsoft, but Microsoft are now talking about 300 terabyte VMs to support fast at the end. next year. Today, Microsoft is a 23 terabyte VM. So this is what 12 times bigger. So they are listening, and if you guys bring those big opportunities forward, we will be able to influence and influence faster. With AWS, we have a process of trying to convince them to become an FSX program. So FSX is AWS. first party. Now, the more opportunities we show AWS, the higher the chance that we can expedite that. If we expedite FSx, we expedite getting the right type of VMs. It's all connected to each other. It's all one big story. So, the best thing you can do is approach us with the opportunities. Go to Salesforce Register, approach us, and you'll get the best support, the best answers and you will get to support us building a product that will

[00:11:20.50]  Jason ValleryRetire your customer requirements. Absolutely. I mean, that's the ammo we need to convince the hyperscalers. When we have these opportunities from customers at this scale, each example brings more attention because it's in their interest to make us successful. So if you have those PepeVide opportunities. make sure we get copied on and we learn about them.

[00:11:42.47]   Remote>> DIRECTOR HAMPSON: I'll share some info on Slack. But yeah thank you. We went through several rounds of conversations. I I know the limitation and for all the above reasons right. Due to due to the nature of the scale and cost and complexity didn't work but they yet yet the. to go with Vaast on-prem, but they're looking forward from Vaast to have a better story than what we currently have, and I'll share all that details. Another good example to a process where the customer got exposed to everything and it did make the customer go with Vaast on-prem. I'll throw that allocation out for one of the other projects we started looking at. at SyncEngine as a way as a closing a gap and between where we are now and where we want to be of enabling customers to move data in and out of object storage on cloud. So again the cloud product right now is evolving faster than the on-prem product. Three or four months ago when we spoke we had five engineers we have 25 engineers. with the end of JSON, many new resources. So even if you engage on cloud six months ago, a year ago, please re-engage, re-engage, share the details. You will be surprised to see that we're in a better place today. - And Beth, to your comment, you said that will burn down a customer. as well. That's a really good point, it absolutely will burn down the customer's cloud commit, which is really important to bring up in conversations. For each cloud, once we're GA and transactable through that respective cloud marketplace, you know, any vast purchase or a private offer will count. towards their current consumption. So that's important 'cause it's a win for both sides. It helps Google hit their Google or whatever cloud, you know, AWS, Azure helps hit their consumption target and gives also customers a way to know, fund BASC projects, BASC on cloud, using budget that they've that they've already committed with their cloud partner. Good point to bring up in conversations with your customers for sure. Hi, this is Madhu. I have a genomics customer who's looking at moving their pipeline into the cloud. They have two VaST clusters, and they're interested in using VaST on cloud and just having their storage closer to their cloud instances. So one of the things we were talking about is just having them use their on-prem clusters and they're modernizing by using S3 and just have those instances talk directly to their VAST clusters so they don't have to buy any additional storage. But if the performance isn't good enough, then we're gonna position VAST on cloud with global namespace. So there's the concept. I think, is straightforward and it seems like a good use case. Also, I mean, the data set that they're working in is about 100 terabytes, and they get rid of the data after, so they don't really have to worry about egress costs or anything. But it's more of the mechanics of spinning up the instance, and I don't exactly know how to how we would transact that how they would fulfill it so some of the more the basic mechanics if they decide to go in that direction um how where is that what's the process where's it done which which cloud uh aws okay and just out of curiosity how big is the vast on-prem in capacity because you're saying it's about 100 terabytes for that data set cloud, so how big are they on-prem? It's a two by two, so where they generate the data from their sequencers is a two by two small cluster, so they generate the data, they stage it, then they move it to another, to where it needs to go. The other cluster is relatively big, though, it's a 12d box, so about 12 petabytes. Okay. Yeah, and that's... for that's for a little bit more longer term where they do all of their um their actual um analysis work their secret yeah so based on other opportunities i just want to mention that it's very common when a customer has 10 20 petabytes of vast on-prem when he looks at this first use case into cloud this example he looks at 100 terabytes right or 200 terabytes So, the way it works is that we don't have the collateral yet because the product is being built as we go into GA, but we should have a full deck before the SE training, which is a week before SE, and we have full marketplace automation that enables us to build a cluster in the customer tenant. It starts from GCP, but within three months, we did the same on Azure and AWS, and that cluster is a minimal cluster for HA of an eight node cluster, and it depends on which cloud to see what's the minimum size of the cluster. The customer can build it on demand when he needs it, and if he doesn't need it, he can shut it down. and then you can build it again. Clearly, you can use global namespace to move the data there. It is planned to be a marketplace transaction. So the customer will go to the marketplace and ask for a private offer to buy that capacity, that 100 terabyte capacity over the four years, and then it will be able to use it when needed for its usage. These clusters that we're discussing because they're running on VM servers on cloud. So these are VMs that are in the fast network and local NVMe drives, kind of similar story to our e-boxes, are designed for performance. So are designed to perform good enough for CPU, GPU, TPU, whatever the customer wants to do, and I do follow up with the details and you can get all these. everything you need, and we can enable, if needed for the customer, a proof of concept. Most of the clouds will also sponsor a proof of concept. It's because it's giving something away, knowing that if the customer likes it, they will get the big PO that will follow. So it's kind of easy to get stuff moving with the cloud and to get them to collaborate. - (indistinct) - Say again? - Yeah, someone got on mute. - Okay, sorry. Every cent that the customer will spend with us on cloud, we usually drive up to 10 cents with the cloud provider for their VMs. So the cloud, the guys, the sales people are very excited to partner with us. So it sounds like a good fit. please do follow up after the call. - All right, and that would just be a DM to you, or what's the best way? - So, right now, we have, so Tiffany, if you could please put it on this. We have a Slack channel, that best thing is to just put it out there, and Jason will be added to the Slack channel, so you will see it as well, and you send it over there. So we talked about it at the beginning, but many other people joined. Right now, we have assigned two amazing sales ladies. One is Tiffany, the other one is Olivia. Tiffany covers anything regarding Azure and AWS. Olivia on the call covers everything regarding GCP or OCI. Solution-wise, we can talk about the solution on all three big CSPs. So that's to include GCP, Azure, AWS. We are playing around with having something ready for OCI. There is a project with Zoom that might push us to do it sooner than later, but we will have a solution on all four within the next three or four months. That solution is what we're calling MVP. and which we kind of described but once you get the collateral you will get clear understanding of what it means but the short story it's an eight node ebox cluster running on cloud so it's a lift and shift product wise it's the same product running on cloud but designed to be easy to use easy to deploy and designed to enable customer to move data around to where GPU, CPU, TPU resources are needed. So to reach out, use the Slack channel. It will be either Tiffany or Olivia that will take the lead, and they will source all the right people from engineering, if needed, from the CTO office, executives, you will get the best support possible. This is priority one for BAST. now with customers on cloud, and to build our next billion dollar business is going to be the business on cloud. In general, you hear cloud, you know, hybrid in any form. Tiffany put our Slack channel in the chat. But that's a great place just to to ping. that chat or you can slack Tiffany or I our job is to help you know with your conversations help validate if it's a right fit connect you with the right resources and help you pursue you know whether it's a POC or a private offer or just having a conversation that enriches what you're already doing with your customer at BAST, we're ready to help and jump in. All right. For our CSPs, a lot of them are using multi-tenancy, and right now, for peering, we peer at a cluster level. So it kind of prohibits-- peering at a tenant level. Is there any roadmap plan to do tenant level peering?

[00:21:54.34]  Jason ValleryJason? I guess I don't fully understand the question. So is your statement that the VASC cluster lives in a single virtual network and you would like to another workload perhaps in this customer? access across the, I'll use Azure terminology 'cause I'm most familiar with it, across the subscription boundaries.

[00:22:16.32]   RemoteYeah, no, so so I I won't. I have a customer that wants to move data between a C between a Neo cloud and Azure and they're they're running on a Neo cloud and in a. multi, they're running on a vast cluster, they're a tenant on a multi-tenant vast cluster, and they want to move from their tenancy in that vast cluster over to one of the clouds. I see, but they don't have a dedicated, so they don't have a dedicated environment without NeoClouds. They're running as a tenant on the NeoCloud, correct? Correct. So this is more about the Neo cloud and the relationship we have with each and every one of them. Technically, a customer can move data from a vast cluster to a vast cluster. Right. So again, what we're building on on the public cloud or vast cluster, then you can use replication or global name system of data. But if your customer is running on as an example, Core, and CoreWeave will not let them use global namespace, then I'm related to our boundaries, that will be the blocking factors. So, you know, again, the details are everything here, but I can tell you that there is a big project out of the UK where the customer is on Azure, and he decided to go to CoreWeave, but tens of petabytes, and he required to... have a dedicated environment so we can have full control and the ability to move data in and out without asking for permission. Yeah. So it's really depends on the, it's not our limitation, it depends on the NeoCloud and the contract we have with them and the type of services they're

[00:23:54.52]  Jason ValleryWilling to offer their customers. The advice you're saying should be putting the pressure on. assume CoreWeave here because you know they choose which features get enabled.

[00:24:03.98]   RemoteYeah, right, right. What I'm saying is today we have to, we can only peer one cluster with one cluster. So if we have a multi-tenant cluster we can't peer the tenants, there's separate tenants in that cluster. So you're saying that for this to work for NEOs that they have to provide dedicated that can't use multi-tenancy in conjunction with cloud? - Okay, that's a different question. I let me get back to you to see what's the roadmap for that. Yes, that's a different question. A single huge cluster used for many tenants on CoWeave, we'd want to replicate into different clusters on cloud because these clusters as of today will be in the customer tenant. then we'll be different clusters, yeah. I'll get back to you with an answer. Okay, thank you. Sorry, I didn't articulate that. No, no, it's, it's okay. No, no, we didn't listen well enough. So, the call just ended. I need to jump on another call for the ones who joined late. Supercomputing is where we're going to have the collateral, the demos for Microsoft, for Google, Indoorboom. in our booth. Guys, the product is ready. It's time to engage. Please engage, and thank you for your time today. - Yeah, thank you. - Thanks everyone. - Bye guys.Pause for group work (upbeat music) Silence. I don't know if you can hear me, but I'm going to stop talking for a moment.

[00:26:47.08]  Jason ValleryMaybe...

[00:27:00.52]   Remote(audience member coughs) I'm going to go ahead and close the webinar.
