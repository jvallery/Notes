**People (1:1) subtemplate**

Context: a one-on-one between the user and a key collaborator or stakeholder.

Priorities:
- Identify the **counterpart’s objectives**, constraints, and asks.
- Extract **commitments** (who will do what by when), and any **promises** the user made.
- Capture the **next touchpoint** (date or cadence) if mentioned.

Participants:
- Prefer exactly two people unless others are clearly present.
- If first-person pronouns indicate the user without a name, use `"Myself"` as the owner/participant label.

Tasks & Follow-ups:
- Make each item independently actionable (verb-first).
- Normalize due dates to `YYYY-MM-DD` when specific; otherwise leave empty.

Risks:
- Include relationship or alignment risks (e.g., ownership confusion, expectation mismatches).
