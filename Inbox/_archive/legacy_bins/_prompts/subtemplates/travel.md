**Travel subtemplate**

Context: organizing or discussing trip logistics.

Priorities:
- Extract **itinerary** facts (city, venue, event name, check-in/out windows, flight numbers if present).
- Convert “book / confirm / hold” statements into tasks with owners and due dates when explicit.
- Record **constraints** (budget caps, preferred airlines/hotels, visa/security requirements).

Participants:
- Usually empty; include only real attendees if a meeting occurred.

Next meeting:
- Use if a planning check-in date is mentioned; otherwise leave empty.
