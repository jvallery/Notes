**Partners subtemplate**

Context: collaboration with a partner (co-sell, marketplace, integration, enablement).

Priorities:
- Track **joint value proposition**, integration points, and GTM motions (co-sell, marketplace listing, MDF, launch).
- Clarify **roles & responsibilities** (who owns product, enablement, delivery, support).
- Call out **mutual dependencies** (certifications, APIs, contractuals).

Tasks:
- Be explicit about **deliverable owners** across orgs (us vs partner).

Risks:
- Surface alignment risks, program gates, or dependency slippage.
