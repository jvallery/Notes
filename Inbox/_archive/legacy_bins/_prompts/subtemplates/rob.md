**ROB (Rhythm of Business) subtemplate**

Context: recurring status/ops meetings (team/functional).

Priorities:
- Summarize **what changed since last meeting**, current **KPIs/health**, and **escalations**.
- Turn updates into **decisions**, **risks**, and **actions** with owners.
- Capture **blocked items** and **unblocked items** explicitly.

Tasks:
- Prefer week-bound commitments when cadence is weekly; otherwise use the date stated.
