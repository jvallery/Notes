Exponential Gains in Compute Efficiency – The cost per unit of computing power drops by an order of magnitude every 3-5 years.

Moore’s Law & Beyond – While Moore’s Law predicted computing power doubling every 18-24 months, specialized AI chips (GPUs, TPUs) have accelerated improvements even faster, making AI training vastly cheaper.

"We are no longer limited by the speed of a single chip, but by the scale of the system."

When Physics Met Specialized Hardware


- **The Unbroken Trend:** This isn't a recent hype cycle; it is the continuation of a stable 100-year trend that persisted through WWII, the Cold War, and the Dot Com crash.
    
- **The Scale:** In 1939, one dollar bought you **0.00007** calculations per second. Today, with the Blackwell chip, it buys you **500 Billion**.
    
- **The Magnitude:** That represents a **75 quadrillion-fold improvement** in price-performance over a single human lifetime.
    
- **The Takeaway:** We are not "getting lucky" with AI breakthroughs; we are arriving on a mathematical schedule that was predicted decades ago.
  
  
  - **The Shift:** We hit the physical limits of general CPUs (Moore's Law), so we switched to specialized AI Accelerators (GPUs/TPUs) which follow a steeper curve ("Huang's Law").
    
- **The Acceleration:** While standard chips double in speed every ~2 years, AI training performance is now doubling every **6 months**.
    
- **The Cost Collapse:** The cost to run GPT-3.5 level intelligence dropped by **>99%** in just four years—from ~$20.00 per million tokens to less than a penny today.
    
- **The Implication:** We are transitioning from an era where intelligence was scarce and expensive to one where it is abundant and free.

  - **The Geopolitical Energy Race:** This is no longer just about software; it is a race for sovereign capacity. The US is projected to reach **~100 GW** of data center demand by 2030 (a massive re-industrialization), while the Middle East is aggressively pivoting oil wealth into digital infrastructure, targeting **400% growth** to become a global compute hub.
    
- **The Grid is the New Bottleneck:** We have moved from a shortage of silicon (chips) to a shortage of electrons (transmission). With utility interconnection queues now stretching **5 to 7 years**, the legacy electrical grid has become the single hardest cap on AI scaling.
    
- **Bypassing the Utility (The Gas Shift):** Tech giants are done waiting for the grid. We are seeing a structural shift to **"Behind-the-Meter" generation**—hyperscalers are building their own on-site power plants (primarily Natural Gas turbines and future Nuclear SMRs) to guarantee the gigawatts they need today, independently of the public grid.
    
- **The Unit of Compute is the Campus:** We have graduated from "Server Rooms" to "Mega-Campuses." Projects like **Stargate (5GW)** and **Crusoe (1.2GW)** are not just data centers; they are city-sized industrial zones that consume as much power as a nuclear reactor or the entire city of San Francisco.
  
  
  Human Intuition Limits

Humans struggle to understand exponential growth, often relying on misleading linear intuition in complex contexts like AI.

Paper Folding Analogy

Folding paper 42 times results in thickness reaching the moon, illustrating exponential growth's rapid escalation.

Transition to Rapid Change

Technology is moving from slow growth to a near-vertical exponential curve, signaling fast and transformative changes.

Importance for AI Advancement

Understanding exponential growth is essential to grasp AI's rapid pace and prepare for its societal impacts.

- **The Blue Line (Knowledge):**
    
    - AI mastering _existing_ human facts (Medical Boards, Bar Exams).
        
    - **Trend:** Linear, predictable growth.
        
- **The Red Line (Reasoning):**
    
    - AI solving _novel_ problems it has never seen before.
        
    - **Trend:** Flatlined for months, then vertical explosion (Nov '25).
        
- **The Breakthrough:**
    
    - **"Deep Think" Architectures:** We finally taught models to _pause and plan_ before they speak.
