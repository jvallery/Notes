# SI strategy, EY design partnership, and cloud roadmap
**Date:** 2025-11-07 · **Project:** GSI Team · **Folder:** Projects/GSI Team

> [!summary] Status Summary (toward next milestone)
The team aligned on a go-to-market strategy with global SIs focused on enterprise workflow automation, not just infrastructure outsourcing. EY is the near-term priority: VAST will pursue a design-partner relationship starting in Azure, with an executive alignment meeting targeted around Microsoft Ignite. Jason outlined the current cloud posture: no GA marketplace offer yet; near-term fit is burst-to-cloud and repatriation, with work underway on optimized VM shapes and potential bare metal to improve economics. The group discussed competitive overlap with Microsoft’s AI Foundry and emphasized VAST’s portability narrative across clouds and on-prem. Accenture is building an opinionated AI/HPC stack where VAST is included; Deloitte’s AI Factory lessons highlighted the need for co-developed, productized solutions vs. pure advisory. A referral incentive program (~3% ACV) is progressing through approvals. Kyndryl will be engaged via a workshop and treated as an incentive-led, non-strategic partner. Immediate actions: include Jason in EY/Accenture threads, prep for the EY CTO meeting, gather EY workload details, and connect Jason to SI BUs focused on workflow automation.

## Key Facts (scope, metrics, links)
- EY targeted as design partner starting on Azure; executive alignment planned around Ignite
- VAST has no GA cloud marketplace offer yet; near-term cloud fit is burst and repatriation
- Exploring optimized VM shapes and potential bare-metal/cloud storage-core integrations
- Accenture building an opinionated AI/HPC stack; VAST currently part of that stack
- Deloitte AI Factory experience showed advisory alone is insufficient; need productized delivery
- Referral incentive program contemplated at ~3% of ACV (licenses only) moving through legal
- Competition/overlap expected with Microsoft AI Foundry; VAST to stress data and workflow portability
- Multiple SIs (TCS, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Infosys) reorganizing around AI; sales/build misalignment exists

## Outcomes (progress this session)
- Agreed to pursue EY as a design partner with an Azure-first motion
- Jason to be included on EY and Accenture threads and briefed on prior work
- Plan an internal prep call before the EY CTO meeting at Ignite
- Strategic focus set on SI business units for workflow automation vs. infra outsourcing
- Kyndryl to be handled via incentive-led engagement with an initial virtual workshop

## Decisions (architecture, resourcing, priority)
- Prioritize EY design partnership on Azure to unlock co-development and portability-led narrative (reversible as partner landscape evolves).
- Concentrate SI engagement on workflow automation practices to drive repeatable end-to-end solutions (reversible if traction is poor).
- Treat Kyndryl as an incentive-driven partner rather than a strategic co-development focus (revisit post-workshop).
- Advance referral incentive program (~3% ACV) to enable pay-for-play partners while protecting margin.

## Risks (schedule, technical, external deps)
- Cloud TCO may erode VAST’s value versus cloud-native alternatives until optimized deployments are available.
- Direct competition/overlap with Microsoft AI Foundry could limit platform adoption in Azure-centric accounts.
- Resource constraints to support multiple SI co-developments may slow execution.
- SI sales and delivery fragmentation can block solution adoption despite strong technical fit.
- EY engagement is contingent on Azure-first execution; delays in cloud readiness could stall progress.
- Referral program not yet finalized; lack of incentives could hinder non-strategic partner engagement.
- Customer GPU estates remain underutilized; failure to activate workloads risks momentum.

## Open Questions
- What specific EY workloads, data sources, and compliance constraints will define the initial design-partner scope?
- What concrete ‘ask’ and success criteria will we present to EY for the design partnership?
- When will the GA cloud marketplace offer be available, and what minimum viable scenarios will it support?
- Can VAST secure optimized VM shapes or bare-metal/storage-core deployments with Azure in the near term?
- Which Accenture/Avanade workflow-automation BUs should be targeted for co-development, and who are the contacts?
- What incentive structure is required to drive Kyndryl execution beyond the initial workshop?
- How will we position complement vs. compete with Microsoft AI Foundry in EY and similar accounts?
