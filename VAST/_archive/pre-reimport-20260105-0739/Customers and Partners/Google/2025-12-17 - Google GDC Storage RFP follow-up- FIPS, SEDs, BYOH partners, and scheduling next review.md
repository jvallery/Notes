# Google GDC Storage RFP follow-up: FIPS, SEDs, BYOH partners, and scheduling next review

**Date**: 2025-12-17
**Account**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Lior Genzel, Jason Vallery, David Pawlak, Kamal Vyas, extraction_errors

## Summary

Google (David Pawlak) requested follow-up clarifications on VAST Data's Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) Storage RFP proposal, specifically FIPS compliance, whether recurring pricing includes hardware and SSD Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs), and BYOH preferred hardware partners. Lior Genzel looped in Jason Vallery to address the SEDs question and proposed targeting a follow-up meeting on Monday, while Google asked if Jason can meet Friday to review a document.


## Action Items


- [?] Provide Google (David Pawlak) clarification on how VAST Data's proposed GDC Storage RFP offering meets FIPS compliance standards raised by Kamal Vyas. @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Answer Google (David Pawlak) whether the proposed recurring pricing solution uses Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs) for the SSD component in the GDC Storage RFP proposal. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm and communicate to Google that VAST Data's proposed recurring pricing includes hardware and SSDs, and that VAST does not sell HDDs, including the caveat that hardware pricing is valid only for the proposal time due to SSD market volatility into 2026. @Lior Genzel #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Check with VAST Data partner groups for the full list of global certified hardware partners and share the list with Google for BYOH planning for the GDC Storage RFP. @Lior Genzel #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Propose specific time slots for a one-hour follow-up meeting with Google to review questions and walk through a Google-provided document, including whether Jason Vallery can meet on Friday or otherwise confirm Monday timing. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto
