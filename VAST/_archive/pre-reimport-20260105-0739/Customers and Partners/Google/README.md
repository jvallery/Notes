## Key Facts

- The presentation share notification was sent from Google Slides via drive-shares-dm-noreply@google.com.

- Lior Genzel stated VAST Data can work with Google to certify a Google-preferred hardware partner for a BYOH approach for the Google GDC Storage RFP due to the large business upside.

- The document share notification was sent from Google Slides/Docs via drive-shares-dm-noreply@google.com.

- Google requested follow-up details in a Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP walkthrough regarding FIPS/SED options, encryption key granularity across S3 and NFS, and S3 SSE-C support.

- The share request email was an automated notification sent from Google Drive (drive-shares-dm-noreply@google.com).

- The notification email for document comments was sent via Google Docs from comments-noreply@docs.google.com.

- Google is the external party associated with the Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP that requires an updated deck.

## Opportunities

- GDC Storage RFP: provide normalized performance + pricing data in Google Excel template for VAST (NVMe/TCP, NFSv4, S3)
- Align first 2–3 lighthouse customers for GCP GA rollout
- TPU strategy outside GCP (pending disclosure; prep meetings such as GTC-DC).
- Cloud deployment capacity/overhead modeling aligned to GCP fault-domain structure and rolling update budgets (MIG maxUnavailable/maxSurge).
- Google private offer marketplace entitlements and pricing schema; approval process initiated
- Similar proxy/tiering conversation as Walmart; relationship with existing cloud stores and namespace integration
- Google Distributed Cloud RFP to replace NetApp storage
- Fort Meade on-prem "Gemini as a service" validation (Q4 commit)
- Joint federal account alignment (FBI, State, Army referenced as opportunities)
- Potential TPU/model-builder partnership track

## Blockers

- ❌ Template requests Self-Encrypting Drives (FIPS 140-2/3), but VAST does not support SEDs; must position software-based dual encryption instead
- ❌ Potential mismatch between requested '112TiB usable' sizing and nearest sellable SKU; must document nearest-SKU approach with extra explanatory rows
- ❌ GA timing dependent on post-bottleneck fix
- ❌ Two-week timeline for disclosure of TPU strategy outside GCP.
- ❌ Sub-zonal availability domain support varies by region/zone; wide EC (e.g., 7+1) depends on actual availability domain guarantees.
