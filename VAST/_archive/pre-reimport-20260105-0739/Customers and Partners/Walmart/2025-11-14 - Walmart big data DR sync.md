# Walmart big data DR sync

**Date**: 2025-11-14
**Account**: [[Walmart]]
**Attendees**: Jason Vallery, Mikey, Brad, Paul

## Summary

Internal team sync to align on Walmart’s big data initiative, with the architecture/whiteboarding session gated on receiving definitive requirements—especially the disaster recovery need (full VAST namespace access in cloud vs a data copy). The team planned a 30-minute expectations/vision call with Mingming on 2025-11-14 after 2pm PT to position current capabilities and the hybrid roadmap (including deeper native Google Cloud Storage integration), while Walmart evaluates minimum vs larger phase-one configurations on a ~1–1.5 month timeline.
## Action Items
- [?] Schedule and send invite for 30-minute call with Mingming after 2 pm PT. @Mikey 📅 2025-11-14 🔺 #task #proposed
- [?] Share Walmart’s requirement answers in Slack before the Mingming call. @Mikey 📅 2025-11-14 🔺 #task #proposed
- [?] Lead the customer call and position current capabilities and hybrid roadmap. @Myself 📅 2025-11-14 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [?] Attend the Mingming call and support with context and Q&A. @Brad 📅 2025-11-14 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [?] Attend the Mingming call and support with context and Q&A. @Paul 📅 2025-11-14 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [?] Notify Alon about the 2 pm PT discussion and share context in case he can join. @Myself 📅 2025-11-14 🔽 #task #proposed

## Decisions
- Do not schedule an architecture/whiteboarding session until Walmart requirements are clarified.
- Lead with current capabilities plus a forward hybrid roadmap narrative in the Mingming call.
- Hold off on detailed technical answers until the Mingming call sets expectations; consider a deeper technical session with additional SMEs after requirements are confirmed.

## Key Information
- Key DR ambiguity to resolve: whether Walmart needs full VAST namespace access in cloud or only a copy of the data.
- VM-based public cloud approach is not viable at the anticipated scale; hybrid approach and more native Google Cloud Storage integration are being prioritized.
- Jason plans to meet engineering in Tel Aviv the week after next (relative to 2025-11-14) to shape the hybrid roadmap, using Walmart as a marquee design partner.
- Two proposals are in play: a minimum configuration vs a larger phase-one proposal (main difference is D-boxes/capacity).
- Walmart timeline signal: decision expected within ~1–1.5 months; opportunity discussed up to ~500 PB and framed as potentially ~$300M if successful.
