## Key Facts

- Testing hasn’t started in earnest at CoreWeave.

- The RFE is associated with an opportunity named 'DGX-C | Coreweave' in Salesforce.

- Jason Vallery stated VAST Data provides storage solutions used for training data and model distribution for large language models at companies including xAI, Tesla, and CoreWeave.

- Jeff Denworth stated CoreWeave testing for the MAI-related effort has not started in earnest.

- Jeff Denworth referenced that the first CoreWeave deal was supported by having Andy Perlsteiner and an unknown person named Leo working out of CoreWeave offices daily, which he said has netted $1.5B in bookings so far.
## Opportunities

- Move faster than others; exemplar NeoCloud; expand services beyond GPUs over time
- Define/validate SLA/SLO commitments and legal penalties; ensure staffing/on-call model meets requirements
- Potentially treat as partner-like engagement model informing VAST-as-a-Service operations
