# Jai update on VAST/Crusoe

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Account**: [[Microsoft]]
**Attendees**: Jai Menon, Jason Vallery

## Summary

Jason reviewed competing offers from VAST and Crusoe, emphasizing VAST’s complex, highly variable compensation tied to OpenAI/Azure outcomes and a near-term Crusoe deadline. Jai indicated Microsoft cannot match Crusoe-level compensation and Apollo scope remains too unclear to define a successful role or path to partner, making staying at Microsoft effectively non-viable. Jason planned to speak with VAST’s CEO to quantify risk and negotiate terms, then decide between VAST and Crusoe and update Jai.
## Action Items
- [?] Meet Renan (VAST CEO) to quantify compensation risk and negotiate terms (equity/commission). @Myself 📅 2025-10-07 🔺 #task #proposed
- [?] Decide between VAST and Crusoe by the Crusoe deadline. @Myself 📅 2025-10-08 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [?] Inform Jai of final decision/status. @Myself 📅 2025-10-08 #task #proposed

## Decisions
- Do not pursue a Microsoft counteroffer given compensation constraints and unclear scope.
- Staying at Microsoft is effectively off the table; proceed toward a decision between VAST and Crusoe with intent to resign by Wednesday.

## Key Information
- VAST offer includes complex, highly variable compensation tied to OpenAI/Azure sales plus equity; near-term income could be very low.
- Crusoe offer has a Wednesday deadline; VAST has not set a decision deadline.
- Microsoft cannot craft a competitive package versus Crusoe; any change would be modest and could be perceived as insulting.
- Apollo scope/responsibilities are unclear, making it hard to define success criteria or a path to partner.
- Jason estimates roughly $800k of vested compensation would be forfeited if leaving Microsoft, narrowing the effective gap versus external offers.
- VAST role is multi-hat (PM plus sales/BD support) including cloud control plane PM ownership and support for Microsoft and OpenAI-related motions.
