# Renen Hallak

## Profile

**Role**: _Unknown_
**Company**: VAST Data
**Email**: renen@vastdata.com

## Key Facts

- Renen Hallak stated he is going to meet flash vendors during CES and cannot change his dates; he also stated he has no time for press interviews.

- Renen Hallak stated Microsoft should have its own flash allocation with NAND manufacturers and that VAST efficiencies could reduce Microsoft's NAND needs and potentially free allocation for other customers.

- Renen Hallak stated that for the prior two weeks a significant portion of VAST Data R&D was redirected to build an auxiliary system to recover nearly 200,000 files on Crusoe's cluster, evolving from manual to semi-automatic to fully automatic recovery.

- Renen Hallak stated the Crusoe incident required recovering every piece of customer data and that VAST Data is committed to never losing a single bit of customer data and maintaining a perfect record.

- Renen Hallak stated that after a crisis was averted the prior week, he is traveling to Las Vegas for CES the upcoming week to help the VAST Data Ops team secure NAND allocation and build strategic relationships with major flash vendors during a shortage.

- Renen Hallak observed strengthened collaboration between VAST Data teams across geographies as the company hires more R&D outside Israel and more G&A in Israel, and he linked this cross-cultural bridge to innovation.

- Jeff Denworth proposed that Renen Hallak be in Redmond in the third week of January 2026 to meet with 'Scott G' to align on the first MAI tranche and scaling plan.
