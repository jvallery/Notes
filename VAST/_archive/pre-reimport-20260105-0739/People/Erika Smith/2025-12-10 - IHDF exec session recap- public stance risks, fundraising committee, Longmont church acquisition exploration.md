## Decisions


- IHDF executive session participants agreed to increase focus on fundraising and to form a fundraising committee with a broader development scope than events and marketing.

- IHDF will conduct an initial feasibility review of a potential acquisition of a former church in Longmont and have the review team report back to the IHDF Board.




## Key Information


- Erika Smith stated that taking public stances on some matters could create issues with tax-exempt status and could disenfranchise donors and the community, and she suggested discussing the impact of current events in an executive session at the end of board meetings.

- IHDF executive session participants agreed to focus more on fundraising and to form a fundraising committee with a broader development lens (beyond events and marketing) that may include non-board members and potentially a budget.

- Perla (last name unknown) was asked to assess IHDF staff needs related to fundraising support; some members believe IHDF currently has the best development staff in place.

- IHDF is exploring a very early-stage idea to acquire a former church in Longmont that is for sale at a low price; the idea is not currently part of any plan and is considered confidential.

- Perla (last name unknown) will share the start of a SWOT document co-created with Erika Smith regarding the potential Longmont church acquisition.

- Maureen (last name unknown), Jorin (last name unknown), Tracy (last name unknown), and Perla (last name unknown) were identified to review initial feasibility of the potential Longmont church acquisition and report back to the IHDF Board; Maureen was noted as having relevant domain expertise, Jorin as having business knowledge, and Tracy as assessing program feasibility.
