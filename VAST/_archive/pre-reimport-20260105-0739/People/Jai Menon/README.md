# Jai Menon

## Profile

**Role**: Founder/CEO at Microsoft (Apollo team (storage side))
**Relationship**: Microsoft stakeholder (context)

**Background**:
- Not directly discussed in transcript; included in known entities but not referenced in this note's narrative.
- Mentioned as storage unit leader/representation in Apollo stakeholder set.
- Referenced as senior leader who could override Azure Storage resistance if aligned with MAI/Apollo priorities.

## Key Facts

- Drives distributed cache strategy for MAI/Apollo; comparing BlobFuse PP against Manifold/Singularity, OpenAI TensorCache, Alluxio/JuiceFS, and in-house options.
- Set and hosts the 2025-10-15 Silicon Valley offsite (day-and-a-half) to align storage/DPU/inferencing stakeholders and build a shared plan.
- Asked for a single recommendation that covers fan-out writes, fan-out reads, and fan-in reads instead of fragmenting across multiple caches; wants perf/scale evidence before engaging MAI.
- Created a Teams room to centralize distributed cache docs, benchmarks, and collateral; coordinating briefings with Vipul/Vishnu and Whipple’s team.
- Concerned about BlobFuse delivery delays and wants clear proof it improves on MAI’s current async copy approach for checkpoints.

## Topics

- Distributed cache strategy (MAI/Apollo)
- BlobFuse PP vs Manifold/Singularity vs TensorCache vs Alluxio/JuiceFS
- Fan-out/fan-in read/write scenarios and KV cache needs
- Silicon Valley offsite logistics and stakeholder alignment
- Teams-room knowledge base and benchmarking plan

## Key Decisions

- Hold a storage/offsite in Silicon Valley on 2025-10-15 (day-and-a-half) to align on distributed cache strategy.
- Use a shared Teams room and briefings (e.g., Vipul/Vishnu, Whipple) to collect artifacts and answer scale/perf questions before deciding.
- Evaluate caches against explicit scenarios (fan-out writes, fan-out reads, fan-in reads/KV) to drive a single recommendation for MAI.
