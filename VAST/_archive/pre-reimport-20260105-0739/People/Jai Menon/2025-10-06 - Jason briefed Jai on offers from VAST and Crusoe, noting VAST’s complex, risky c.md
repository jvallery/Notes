# 1:1 — Jai Menon — 2025-10-06

> [!info] Purpose
> Build trust, surface and remove blockers, align on priorities, coach & grow.

## Summary

Jason briefed Jai on offers from VAST and Crusoe, noting VAST’s complex, risky compensation and Crusoe’s Wednesday deadline. Jai shared that Microsoft cannot craft a competitive compensation package and that Apollo’s scope remains unclear, making it hard to define a successful role or path to partner. Jason indicated the Microsoft option is effectively closed and plans to finalize between VAST and Crusoe after speaking with VAST’s CEO.

## Key facts learned

- Jason has a VAST offer with complex, highly variable compensation tied to OpenAI/Azure sales plus equity.
- Crusoe offer deadline is Wednesday.
- VAST has not set a decision deadline.
- Microsoft cannot approach Crusoe-level compensation; any change would be modest.
- Apollo scope and responsibilities are unclear, hindering definition of a successful role/path to partner.
- Jason values owning clear scope, hands-on technical work, and influencing customer deals.
- Jason estimates ~$800k in vested comp would be forfeited if leaving Microsoft, narrowing the gap versus external offers.
- Jai does not want to push Manish for a small, potentially insulting offer.
- Jason has a meeting with Renan (VAST CEO) the next morning to quantify risk and negotiate terms.
- Jason is leaning toward VAST if risks are quantified and numbers adjusted.
- Jason expects to resign by Wednesday.

## Outcomes

- Acknowledged that staying at Microsoft is effectively off the table for Jason.
- Agreement that Jai will not pursue a modest counter with Manish given low likelihood and risk of it being insulting.
- Jason will update Jai after finalizing discussions with VAST and Crusoe.

## Decisions

- Do not pursue a Microsoft counteroffer given compensation constraints and unclear scope.
- Jason to proceed toward a decision between VAST and Crusoe, with a plan to resign by Wednesday.

## Action items (for Jai Menon)

- [x] Meet Renan (VAST CEO) to quantify compensation risk and negotiate terms (equity/commission). @Jason Vallery ⏫ 📅 2025-10-07 ✅ 2025-10-26
- [x] Decide between VAST and Crusoe by the Crusoe deadline. @Jason Vallery 🔺 📅 2025-10-08 ✅ 2025-10-26
- [x] Inform Jai of final decision/status. @Jason Vallery 🔼 📅 2025-10-08 ✅ 2025-10-26

## Follow-ups

- [x] (none) ✅ 2025-10-26

## Risks

- VAST compensation variability (commission tied to OpenAI/Azure sales) could result in very low near-term income.
- Lifestyle impact until variable compensation materializes.
- Apollo program ambiguity and stakeholder misalignment at Microsoft could impede execution.
- Aggressive timelines to deliver platform with limited runway increase execution risk.
- Multi-hat VAST role (PM, BD, sales support) may dilute focus and introduce execution complexity.

## Open questions

- What specific adjustments will VAST make to equity and commission to de-risk compensation?
- What is the precise scope, responsibilities, and success criteria for the VAST role across PM, BD, and sales support?
- Are there any final terms from Crusoe that materially change the decision calculus?

> Next meeting (if any): (none)

Hi, sir. How are you? Um, doing all right. A little bit, uh, anxious, I suppose. Uh... Let's see. What's the latest news?

[00:03:53.19] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryOh, I'm sorry.

[00:03:54.06] Parallels Desktop : Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. What's the latest news?

[00:03:57.19] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryOh, I'm sorry. Okay. What's the latest news? Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:04:01.06] Parallels Desktop : Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:04:02.06] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryOh, I'm sorry.

[00:04:03.24] Parallels Desktop : What's the latest news? Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:04:05.53] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryOkay.

[00:04:06.06] Parallels Desktop : What's the latest news?

[00:04:07.57] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason Valleryon your side? I have an offer from VAST. It's a complex offer, Jay. It has all kinds of different components to it and it's really difficult to come up with a real gut check of what it's worth. I'll just say that. trying to think through it and look at it carefully. I have, it's an interesting job. I think the work is interesting. I think the scope is interesting. I think I just don't know how confident I am that it is net financially beneficial compared to the Crusoe job compared to staying at Microsoft. so that's kind of where I'm at at the moment. Nobody made it easy for you, huh?

[00:05:06.86] Parallels Desktop : Anything you have to share with me? Yeah, I think, you know, I think the challenge, I mean, I talked to of times over the weekend and so on. I think, you know, I think the, it's, it's, it's difficult to do something that's, you know, compared to what you're getting from Crusoe. I mean, I think anything that Manisha's talking about doing, you know, it's, you know, it's, you know, it's, it's, is pretty modest. So I think he's not sure it makes sense because you may, you know, you may look at it and go, "Oh my God, that's it? That's all you can do?" So I think there's a concern that, you know, just probably, yeah, to avoid... avoid a sense on your part of you know, but even that will take him some effort. So he's not it's not I think he he's Yeah, he's having a hard time trying to sort out So Yeah, that's kind of where or you know, we're at what are you your dates I mean, like, I know you, I think Crusoe, you got extended to Wednesday, Vast probably a little bit more time since they just gave it to you, I don't know, but that's true?

[00:06:34.64] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryVast hasn't given me any deadline. I mean, Crusoe is the date that I'm really working against. So, yeah, I've got a pretty short fuse, obviously, on the Crusoe deal, and that's probably the one that drives the timeline. I mean, setting aside compensation at Microsoft, did you have a chance to talk about what scope potentially looks like? 'Cause I think, honestly, that's really more for me, the thing that I wanna know the job I'm doing is when I can be set up for success, and then compensation kind of seems a little bit as a secondary thought to that. Is that something that you and Manish discussed?

[00:07:07.75] Parallels Desktop : Yeah we we did it but I think I think I think certainly the compensation part of it seemed challenging so I think I think I think we got stuck a little bit there I think I think on the job scope, yeah, I mean, you know, as we discussed, the Apollo thing is still in flux and, yeah, I think it's going to be, I think there's some, there's some thinking in you know the discussion we've had about managing a development team versus managing a PM team. I mean I think everyone's seen you very successfully doing things on the PM side and we don't have enough experience with you managing a dev team so But, but honestly, I think the compensation part was where we kind of got, you know, hung up on. So, yeah, that.

[00:08:27.19] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryWhere does it leave us? It sounds like I'm going to go pick either Crusoe or Vast and there's probably nothing here I need to consider.

[00:08:37.65] Parallels Desktop : Yeah, at the moment, I'm still, yeah, I mean, I think, I think, yeah, it did, I mean, yeah, I mean, I think, I think, I think Manish wants to avoid a situation where he does a bunch of work and comes up with something compensation-wise that ends up. looking like, you know, insulting to you, which I think given the two million over there, you know, this number will look like, oh my god, what are you guys doing to me kind of thing. So I think it's, you know, it'll be, yeah, he'll have to. you'll have to struggle for getting a tenth of that, and I think you might look at it and go,

[00:09:28.71] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason Vallery"Shit, that's all you can do for me." Well, a tenth would certainly knock, remember. Well, I mean, I was certainly looking at this, just to be clear. I think I have 800-something thousand invested that I'd be giving up by leaving. So you take that off the top of the two million and you leave. you know, 1.1, 1.2 million, that would be incremental, and then I think about stock refreshers and bonus things that may or may not have played out correctly, and that it's not as wide of a gap that we're closing. But certainly if you came back and said 200 grand, I would be like, well, that's not gonna work. So I think that-

[00:10:04.49] Parallels Desktop : - Yeah, that's kind of where, I think that's very much- is coming from right is that what he thinks he can do versus yeah what you wouldn't you would not find insulting I think he's just trying and it's I don't think yeah I don't think yeah that's what that's what he thinks it's even, yeah, I think it's going to take him some work to do that. So yeah, I don't know what to say.

[00:10:39.22] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryI think it's pretty clear. I mean, you know, you don't have to tap dance around it. It's pretty clear. I'll have to find a different path here, and, you know, it's.., and you know, it's not how I had hoped all of this would play out when I first approached Ganesh about, you know, moving into a different role, and it's, it is what it is, you know.

[00:11:03.75] Parallels Desktop : I, yeah.

[00:11:04.76] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryThere's lots of opportunity out there, and I'll go and—

[00:11:07.93] Parallels Desktop : Yeah, there clearly is, and you've definitely proven that there is a lot of good opportunity out there. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:11:16.20] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryWell, anything else to chat about?

[00:11:25.35] Parallels Desktop : No, I think, yeah, I, you know, I think, yeah, I, I was, yeah, I think, I think you've made it clear that it would. be insulting, so I think that's a takeaway for me that it's not worth my pushing him to do that, so I think you clarified that, which was helpful to me because I wanted to do something, but I think you clarified that, so that's good.

[00:12:00.21] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryAnd how it's going to make me stay, and 200, I think it's the scope piece and not having any clarity around that is kind of like, I mean, I need to own something, have a deliverable, be able to knock it out of the park and really know that I'm going to have an upward career trajectory. When I approached Manish about switching over to your team, that I want to know that I have a clear path to partner, and there's no obvious scope here that gets me that. So that's the big issue right now.

[00:12:32.25] Parallels Desktop : - Yeah. - Yeah, I guess it is what it is.

[00:12:42.29] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryWell, I will be updated as I.

[00:12:45.27] Parallels Desktop : Finalize this process. Okay, I mean did he did he tell you anything about the path to partner

[00:12:52.74] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryWhen you when you first approached him? I mean I will verbatim tell you what he said to me, Jay. Like, you know, this is a call that went down in whatever it was like early May, I think. I said, I can't report a bombshell anymore. I've asked on the three times for a different manager and all three times Aung has said no. So I'm coming to you Manish, I can't report to Bombshe anymore. I think Jay is a great guy. I was like, that's exactly what I said. Verbatim, that's what I said, and he said, okay, okay, and I'm like, you know, I wanna have know that I have clear scope and about the partner, and he's like, and his verbatim response was, I'll go talk to Girish about partner. right now, and so I went off from, that was the last time I spoke to Manish, then I went off on my sabbatical, and I tell you, I thought I was coming back to being celebrated for the impact of last year, and I came back to 100% rewards and no scope and no obvious path to partner and nothing to do. like what am I supposed to do with that?

[00:13:56.96] Parallels Desktop : Yeah, I mean I think yeah, I mean there's going to be a lot of responsibilities around Apollo, it's just that it's it's so much in flux that it's not clear to me exactly what that be right now. But someone, you know, someone's going to do a lot of work on Apollo, and I'm sure Juggin's team will, you know, build a bunch of stuff. I'm sure somebody will have to play the role of a you know, senior architect, and I mean that could be you, but I think it's just very hard to define it right now. That's my struggle, being very transparent about...

[00:14:56.25] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryRight, taking off the other conversations we're having, I tell you... like the timeline here is crazy. I don't know how any of this is gonna be successful since we haven't started work on any of it. The data centers are going live, the customers are there. You've gotta deliver a platform with no runway in terms of time to get it there. How does that play out?

[00:15:22.83] Parallels Desktop : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think. To. Can't. I just I just see a lot of parties involved in Apollo and a lot of people that have limited knowledge. that are trying to make decisions with incomplete knowledge about other aspects and how our house storage works and so on so it's like it's uh there's an old saying i don't know

[00:15:59.51] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason Valleryif it's come across your vocabulary since you haven't maybe been around as long but called licking the cookie where you know Everyone at Microsoft comes along and tries to lick the cookie. I know a project like this has a bunch of cookie lickers on it. So what ends up happening is nothing actually makes forward progress because everybody wants to stake a claim, and then you get bogged down. Sounds like exactly what's happening for Apollo.

[00:16:30.90] Parallels Desktop : Yeah, there's not enough clarity for me. I tend to like clarity and there isn't a lot of clarity about what's inside Apollo, what's outside Apollo, what workload is inside, what workloads are outside, what's in, what's out. what's allowed, why is something not allowed, why is something allowed? There's uncertainty, there's a lot of uncertainty. Now, you know, my guess is it'll get ironed out over time, and then we'll go execute, I assume. But... well yeah yeah I think yeah I think it's it's difficult for me because you know it's like you know you've had discussions with others and then you moved over but then wasn't As soon as he moved over, you took off for some time. So I'm just trying to find the right thing to do here, but yeah.

[00:17:48.93] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason Vallery- You're in the middle of it all. This isn't any reflection of our relationship or anything. It's just a complicated thing.

[00:17:55.65] Parallels Desktop : - No, it's just a very complicated thing. But yeah, I know Manish has, you know, also chatted with Ong and others on the other side about this whole situation, so yeah, I think, yeah, if, you know. Yeah, right now, I mean, yeah, I'm finding a hard time giving you absolute clarity on this is your role and this is what it takes to be successful, given, given where Apollo is, and I'm also being very transparent with you about financially what the number might look like, and I only shared it with you just to get an initial. reaction from you because, you know, if, if, if, if, you know, that was in the game, I would go, I'd go talk to Manish about it, but I think, yeah, I think given the, given that the number itself is not interesting to you and given the lack of clarity around exactly how you can be super successful to get you wherever you want to be um yeah and I'm struggling so I guess yeah well yeah I think Yeah, I think you, I guess you have clarity on what happens here, there, or everywhere now. There's as much clarity as you'll get on what happens if you go to West, what happens if you go to Krug, if so, and what happens if you stay. I think you have as much clarity, probably not exactly what you were looking for, but there is, I think, it's interesting. feels like all three are muddy for you.

[00:19:57.35] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryYeah, I mean, I can have a quick--

[00:19:58.79] Parallels Desktop : You've got three muddy options.

[00:20:00.17] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryI'll give you just slightly more. I think one door is closed. I'll just say I don't see staying at Microsoft being a door that's still open. I do see both the Crusoe and DAS door open, so I will-- you my thinking. The Crusoe door is a stabler door and the valuation goes up. The VAST role is more interesting and they've given me a very odd compensation structure and it would be, I'll just tell you, like they want me to go and make sure that VAST is successful at OpenAI and on Azure. vast replacement of storage at OpenAI and the compensation structure they've given me is very risky. It's a percentage of sales to OpenAI and on Azure. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

[00:20:52.18] Parallels Desktop : Yeah, that is, that is tricky and risky. Yeah. so is it is it a is it a pm type role or a sales type role or what is it

[00:21:14.41] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason Valleryit's uh they want me to do it all it is it'll have a pm type title um reporting to jeff you know and ran in like they're one, they're two in a box kind of, you know, working pretty closely with both guys. You know, they're going to build out, obviously a vast on Azure offering that's already in the works, and so there's a PMing component of managing a PM that would work with, they just acquired this company called Red Stapler. It was founded by the guy that did the NetApp deal, Jan C. Stefansson, and so his charter is to go and build a cloud control plane, and so I would own the PM portion of building out a cloud control plane, and then they built out a business development team that's in the sales organization. that is focused on the cell to and cell with relationship for Microsoft. So I'd have a dotted line over there to support them, and then lastly, they have a cell to relationship that they've just got started for Project Stargate for OpenAI, and I'd have a dotted line into that team.

[00:22:25.33] Parallels Desktop : Got it. OK.

[00:22:28.67] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason VallerySo it's a complicated thing, right?

[00:22:31.40] Parallels Desktop : Yeah.

[00:22:31.46] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryI mean, that's the nature of one of these startups is they're like, "You're going to wear all of that. We're going to have you doing PMing and sales, and we're going to go with a bunch of people together. You're going to be my right-hand guy, and we're going to go figure this out."

[00:22:49.72] Parallels Desktop : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If this door is closed, then between the two other options?

[00:23:01.15] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryI need to, so I mean, just being really transparent, I have a meeting with Renan in the morning, a vast CEO, and I need to quantify the risks in this offer that gave me a little bit better - Assuming he gives me enough confidence and maybe tweaks a couple of numbers, I'll probably end up with the best.

[00:23:21.81] Parallels Desktop : - Got it, yeah. - Yeah. - Right, in case you get to stay at home.

[00:23:28.75] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason Vallery- Yeah, but the problem is that the compensation is somewhere between zero and many millions of dollars. As far as I can tell right now, so I mean, you know.

[00:23:42.25] Parallels Desktop : (laughing) - I see. - Yeah. - So it would still challenge your current lifestyle. Potentially.

[00:23:52.95] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason Vallery- Very much so.

[00:23:53.78] Parallels Desktop : - Until the million starts showing up, yeah.

[00:23:57.26] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason Vallery- Yeah, I mean, there's an equity component structured as a commission component. The commission component is difficult to quantify and the equity component was kind of disappointing so I got to go pushing a little bit and figure out where we end up. But yeah, you know I'm trying to pull this off tomorrow or Wednesday so you'll later than Wednesday with the resignation.

[00:24:24.99] Parallels Desktop : - Okay. Okay, I understand. Yeah. Yeah, it's disappointing. But yeah. - Yeah. - If I had more history with you, you know, but I just. I think it is what it is.

[00:24:57.69] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryWell, you know, I look at it from the lens of I'm a deeply technical guy and I want to be hands-on writing, you know, helping you write code. and being successful with Execution Apollo, but I still also really like to win deals, to influence customers, and not being in my hands or kind of tied up. So, you know, no matter what, I came back with great compensation. I still wouldn't get to

[00:25:23.66] Parallels Desktop : do what I actually think I do best. Yeah, yeah, that's fair. Totally fair, and yeah, like I said before, I've seen you operate at OpenAI and other places and I think you have tremendous strengths there, so.

[00:25:39.67] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryOkay, well, I'll be in touch. I appreciate you, Jay.

[00:25:46.46] Parallels Desktop : All right. Okay, well, I'll look to hear from you and... Yeah, hopefully we'll stay in touch either way, whatever happens.

[00:25:59.40] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryAll right.

[00:26:00.30] Parallels Desktop : Thanks, man.

[00:26:01.13] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryTalk to you later.

[00:26:02.24] Parallels Desktop : All right. Bye. Yeah, bye.
