# Jeff Denworth escalation: MAI supply chain risk and need for immediate deployment plan (no Microsoft inventory reserved)

**Date**: 2025-12-21
**With**: Jeff Denworth, Jason Vallery, Lior Genzel, Renen Hallak, Alon Horev, Shachar Fienblit, Avery Pham, Jonsi Stefansson, Rick Scurfield, Anson (Qi), Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, Karén Simonyan, Kushal (last name unknown), Mustafa (last name unknown), Vipin (last name unknown), Vamshi (last name unknown), Manish (last name unknown), Sagar (last name unknown), Nidhi (last name unknown)

## Summary

Jeff Denworth escalated that VAST is selling out of supply and lead times are increasing, so any MAI deployment in April to June 2026 requires an immediate plan and ordering action now. He asked whether Microsoft expects to use VAST's supply chain and emphasized that nothing is reserved for Microsoft, making this a serious near-term execution risk.


## Action Items


- [?] Confirm with Microsoft MAI stakeholders whether Microsoft expects to use VAST Data supply chain for MAI storage deployment hardware, given VAST has no inventory reserved for Microsoft and lead times are increasing. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Align internally on a concrete procurement and delivery plan for a potential MAI deployment in April to June 2026, including what must be ordered now and from which suppliers, given supply chain constraints through 2026. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Work with Lior Genzel to secure introductions to Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, and Karén Simonyan to build direct relationships with MAI decision stakeholders beyond Kushal (last name unknown). @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Determine the most strategic large-GPU environment to run Anson (Qi)'s VAST proof of concept (MAI/Vipin environment vs Nscale vs CoreWeave) to enable 1,000 to 2,000 GPU scale performance validation. @Lior Genzel ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Alon Horev on options for where to run Anson (Qi)'s PoC and how to merge Kushal's MAI plan with Qi's PoC plan into a single validation path. @Lior Genzel #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Lior Genzel will take the lead on obtaining introductions to key MAI decision stakeholders (Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, Karén Simonyan) to reduce reliance on Kushal (last name unknown) as the primary conduit.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated VAST Data is selling out of supply quickly and hardware lead times are increasing significantly, creating risk for any near-term MAI deployment.

- Jeff Denworth stated there is currently no inventory reserved for Microsoft for the MAI storage deployment.

- Jason Vallery heard from multiple Azure stakeholders that the final MAI storage decision is made by Mustafa (last name unknown).

- Jason Vallery heard from multiple Azure stakeholders that Kushal (last name unknown) cannot be trusted as a reliable source of truth for MAI decisioning.

- Jason Vallery stated he has no existing relationship with Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, or Karén Simonyan and needs introductions to build trust with MAI stakeholders beyond Kushal.

- Lior Genzel reported that MAI's initial GPU delivery is expected in February 2026 and MAI needs a storage solution ready for the May to June 2026 timeframe, with January no longer a hard deadline.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal (MAI) said MAI will decide on the storage deployment and told Manish (last name unknown) that Azure Blob does not meet MAI requirements compared to VAST.

- Lior Genzel reported that Vamshi (last name unknown), leader of Azure Blob, emphasized the decision is internal to Microsoft and expressed frustration with VAST highlighting Azure Blob deficiencies aggressively.

- Lior Genzel reported that Anson (Qi) requested moving his VAST proof of concept into a large GPU environment (MAI/Vipin environment or Nscale/CoreWeave) because Microsoft labs lack 1,000 to 2,000 GPUs for scale performance testing.

- Renen Hallak stated Microsoft should have its own flash allocation with NAND manufacturers and that VAST efficiencies could reduce Microsoft's NAND needs and potentially free allocation for other customers.

- Jeff Denworth stated supply chain constraints are expected through 2026 and recommended taking the full MAI deal down in one transaction with partial delivery milestones.
