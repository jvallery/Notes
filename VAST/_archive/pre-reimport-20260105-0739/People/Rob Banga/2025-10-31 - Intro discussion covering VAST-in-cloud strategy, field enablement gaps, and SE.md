# 1:1 — Rob Benoit — 2025-10-31

> [!info] Purpose
> Build trust, surface and remove blockers, align on priorities, coach & grow.

## Summary

Intro discussion covering VAST-in-cloud strategy, field enablement gaps, and SE org realities. Alignment on using object storage + bare metal for cloud economics, and on DataSpaces/global namespace as a key differentiator. Agreed to meet at Tech Summit and keep a feedback loop between cloud roadmap and field pain points.

## Key facts learned

- Jason reports to Jeff; charter is making VAST successful on hyperscalers and marketplaces
- Jason background: ex-Microsoft Azure Storage GPM; primary storage relationship for OpenAI; AI-scale object storage focus
- Rob leads global pre-sales SE org; 18 years at NetApp; strong networking/sysadmin background
- VAST cloud deployment is complex; marketplace should expose tenant outcomes, not admin of clusters
- Cloud VM economics are poor for VAST at scale; need object storage for capacity tier + bare metal for performance
- GCP Z3 helps but gets expensive at size; bare metal instances are preferred
- VAST global namespace/DataSpaces is a major differentiator for hybrid/multi-cloud AI
- OpenAI pattern: central CPU-adjacent data lake + GPU-adjacent working set cache across many regions/clouds
- Field enablement/content ownership is fragmented; duplicative Confluence docs; unclear owners
- Gaps in enterprise data/AI selling skills; many SEs are storage-centric
- SE bandwidth constrained by installs (rack/stack ~2 weeks), reducing selling time
- New partner program created to offload rack-and-stack; cabling errors can cause multi-day delays
- High networking skills required (400G, leaf-spine, VXLAN, BGP) across SE org
- Tech Summit approved (~200 attendees; a little over $500k cost); Renan supports SE investment

## Outcomes

- Alignment on cloud approach: object tier for capacity + push CSPs for bare metal
- Shared view that DataSpaces/global namespace underpins AI data mobility patterns
- Agreement to connect at Tech Summit for deeper discussion
- Established two-way feedback loop between field pain points and cloud roadmap

## Decisions

- Meet at Tech Summit for follow-up conversation

## Action items (for Rob Benoit)

- [x] Schedule coffee with Rob during Tech Summit @Jason Vallery 🔼 ✅ 2025-11-08
- [x] Share initial VAST cloud roadmap context with SE leadership @Jason Vallery 🔼 ✅ 2025-11-08
- [x] Provide consolidated field pain points on current product for cloud/hyperscaler use @Rob Benoit 🔼 ✅ 2025-11-08

## Follow-ups

- [x] Confirm time and location for Tech Summit meeting @Jason Vallery 🔽 ✅ 2025-11-08
- [x] Loop in Yancey and relevant owners on marketplace and bare-metal plans as needed @Jason Vallery 🔽 ✅ 2025-11-08

## Risks

- Marketplace offers that require customers to manage complex VAST admin will underperform
- Cloud VM cost/performance ratios make large-scale deployments uneconomical
- Field lacks sufficient enterprise data/AI and app/platform expertise
- SE time consumed by onsite installs reduces prospecting and sales coverage
- Documentation and solution content ownership is unclear, causing inconsistency and delays
- Networking complexity (400G fabrics, VXLAN/BGP) is a high bar for many SEs

## Open questions

- Who will own end-to-end solution content (beyond feature docs) for the field?
- What is the timeline and path to bare-metal instances with each CSP?
- How will VAST scale enterprise data/AI expertise across the field beyond a small specialist team?
- What is the adoption plan and SLAs for the new partner rack-and-stack program?

> Next meeting (if any): (none)

[00:00:00.04]  Jason ValleryYeah, I'm super excited to be here like this is truly a rocket ship and it's exciting to be in a place with so much energy and momentum. Yeah, I don't know what you know about me, but I figured it'd be more like, let's have a quick intro I'd learn more about you, your role here and yep perfect heard your name a bit. it. So yeah, sounds good. I'll start off, I guess. So, you know, I'm sure you've heard some rumors. I started last week reporting to Jeff. Kyle's VP of cloud product management. I think we're still figuring out all of what that means, but the idea is to really focus on making mass successful on the hyperscalers and you know, the marketplace. but more much more than that in my mind like how do we evolve the product to support these kinds of frontier scenarios that we see with customers like opening eye and others and Microsoft AI that's like was literally just shot chatting to Microsoft AI so I apologize that's why I was late. But maybe it's important to kind of go backwards in time and tell you a bit of how I got to this. I spent the first years of my career as a software developer. I'm a software developer, so I'm a very hands-on, technical kind of guy. I really do get into the weeds, really like to understand how things work. About 13 years ago, I saw the writing on the wall that is the public cloud, cloud-gained principles, design patterns. As a developer, it got me super excited. I jumped in as we started at Microsoft, sort of at the dawn of Azure, right when it was getting started. my first real gig in the I moved into the Azure Storage Organization and focused on object storage. My first real gig like looking at APIs and SDKs for Azure Storage and you know natural progression from my background in app dev and then I've worn pretty much every hat in the the object storage team sense, uh, working with our whale. customers, frontier workloads, anybody that was pushing the edges of capacity, performance, throughput, TPS kind of things. I departed there as a GPM group product manager, owning most of the object storage platform, focused on AI storage side of it. Got connected to OpenAI in 2018 when they first started playing around with the cloud. and Microsoft tossed him some free Azure credits and said, "Go see what you can do with these." Rode that journey all the way through to the end as well as they kind of grew on the platform to many, many, many exabytes, and through that, I was their primary storage relationship owner and got to know all of their workloads, their scenarios, how they think about capacity management, how they think about organizing data sets, all of those fun topics, and yeah, why VAST? I have always had a deep respect for the platform. I've done competitive analysis in the past and really looked at it, particularly when we were getting serious about AI. You know, it was sort of the reference architecture in my mind of how I wanted Azure Storage to evolve because you guys had already done the good work. Yep, I'm sure you know Glenn Lockman. he came over in July, he and I worked closely together at Microsoft and he was a catalyst and it was a, you know, seems to be at the right time at the right moment to really seize the whale. There's my 60-year-old version of what I've got.

[00:03:14.12]   RemoteThere you go. No, that's great stuff. Did you know Carl Roundscratch from... I've known Carl for a decade. Yeah. So Carl and I worked together many, many years at NetApp together, so various different roles. We were both on the solution specialist side. We were field CTOs together at one time, and then I think Carl even, right before his departure, right, I think he worked for me even at one point in time, so Carl's good people. You know, it was sad to see him leave, but I know he's done some good stuff over at Microsoft

[00:03:45.08]  Jason ValleryYeah, I mean he's been on the same team with me for most of that time. He had a little sabbatical where he went and worked in the field for a little while but then came back to Azure Storage. He's been, I think that entire time, partner focused. As a part of my team, I didn't manage him because he was more on the like, you know, there's kind of PMs that are vertically. in it, uh, oriented, which like you own features, capabilities, uh, and like workload scenarios, and then there's more like horizontals, which are like we own partners and sales play and go to market kind of stuff, and he's been on that side of the product work, but we partner, we've worked together in a lot of areas over the years, and yeah, I literally had a related on the massive, I had a call

[00:04:26.63]   RemoteWith him this morning. So it was good. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. So just a little on what I do here. So I'm responsible for the global pre-sales SC organization. I've only been with Vast now nine months. In fact, the end of quarter today, it'll be my nine month, three quarter anniversary in the company. Prior to that, I was at NetApp for 18 years, a long time. I can't believe how many hats I wore at NetApp. NetApp. When I left, I was responsible for, really, what I would say, we had a chief commercial office. I ran all technology enablement, right? That's everything from go to market to our lab environments to, you know, customer proof of concept environments, field CTOs, solution architects. That was all really the specialist organizations were. nothing that was direct account aligned. I ran for that for three years. Prior to that, I ran the America's SE organization. So, you know, a number of different, you know, whether it was management roles, but always on the technology side, like you. I always had an engineering background. I've been more on the systems administration side. Networking, I started as a, I was a CTO. for Cisco and then you know wind up various running Unix for a number of financial services companies. I was at Goldman Sachs, I was at TI Crafts, so I ran Unix engineering, which what networking was kind of a gray area back then, you know evolved into Linux networking and then eventually a storage. They didn't know where to put storage when it started becoming more dedicated. So I kind of took the ball and ran with that and then eventually landed at NetApp. So pretty good background. I know Yahtzee really well. Yahtzee and I partnered at NetApp for the go-to-market for the NetApp's cloud business. So I did, you know, I ran all the enablement with Yahtzee. So things like, you know, when we launched, whether it was the marketplace offerings. you know, with Azure or AWS or Google. You know, I built, my team built all the go-to-market collateral and content working in conjunction with Yanti. I also had a solutions team that would build the solution collateral. So, you know, how do we integrate into the different offers that are available through the different hyperscalers? And then, you know, I was, we, I also work with Yancey on the go-to-market for the first-party services that they, you know, whether it was FSXN, Parade, AWS, or the Azure NetApp Files, which was the, the original first-party offering that we built. So I go pretty far back with Yancey, I was talking to him before he joined. I was talking to Renan to kind of encourage Renan to hire Yancey, I thought he'd be a to what we're trying to do here, right? So that's a little background on myself.

[00:07:12.86]  Jason Vallery- What do you think about current state of play in terms of VaST on cloud and where it needs to go? And I mean, you've been up for nine months, what's your take? You've seen the NetApp side of it. It sounds like maybe you have some familiarity with like what Azure NetApp files ended up being

[00:07:30.15]   RemoteSo the challenge that we have at VaST, getting an instance of ONTAP running in the marketplace as a standalone instance is fairly easy, it's just an image. Getting an instance of VaST up and running is not trivial, it's a complex architecture. is based on the design principle of what it does, right? You know, installing VAST in a data center is difficult. It's not the simplest thing to do in the world, right? So our offers of, hey, link a whole bunch of, you know, VMs together, create a virtual network, right? To build a VAST cluster, I don't think is as, and then try to build something that's not only performant, it's not it's not trivial right it's not an easy thing to do here right so I think marketplace offerings I think in the right way but it's got to be in the marketplace you got to be consuming the outcome of a vast cluster not the administrative side of the vast cluster right so I think if we can deploy tenants right and then let you know someone that knows that administer the, you know, the views or the way we provision and present, um, you know, data, uh, capabilities, whether it's, you know, data services, whether that's, you know, our, our file services, our object services, or even what we do around some of the more advanced data services like, you know, Kafka or, uh, what we do for, um, you know, some of the, uh, the table, uh, actions. access points we have through the database side of the house, I think if we can, if that's the end point, we'll be pretty successful, right? But I think we've still got a long way to go to get there, right? Or at least in Yancey's world, I think he's got a pretty, he's got to build some of the plumbing in there to make, you know, to attract a lot of the complexities of what the architecture is about.

[00:09:23.00]  Jason ValleryYeah. I mean, I think a lot about the capacity to performance ratios and how, you know, it just doesn't make sense on cloud VMs. Fundamentally, there's got to be a better way, and I think there's a couple of dimensions you can push. You've got to offload the cloud primitives, meaning make better use of object storage and use that as your capacity up here and do that efficiently, and then you've got to push the CSPs to give us the opportunity. to leverage a much more efficient, much more tuned, bare-metal kind of hardware environment. Either the CSPs buy it or we bring vast ODM hardware into their data centers. I think that's the only way this works out at the CSPs ultimately, because just the economics just don't pencil out otherwise.

[00:10:03.25]   RemoteNow, it's a layer in there that just that that layer is really... is where we're going to get caught up, right? And then plus there, when you rely on their VMs themselves, right, what they provide, they're already cost modeling, you know, the outcome they need where we still got to put a layer of value on top of it, right? So it's, it just hasn't seemed to scale the way we want. It's nice that you can start one up and, you know, GCP gives us the Z3 instance now, which is better. when you get even beyond a certain size, it starts to get expensive too, right? So, um, you know, I, I agree with you. They've got, we've got to figure out how do we get a bare metal? It's the beauty for us is if we can get the right bare metal instance, we can make it work. Right, and then you order the ploy on the bare metal, and then from there, the orchestration comes at the tenant level, right? So now you can carve out a tenant. That's your virtual, you know, environment. that's really at the end of the day what we need to do. So if we can get there, and I know Yancey's got some plans to try to get there, I think that's when we really start to see the acceleration of it. The one big value that we never had at NetApp that Vast has, we never had at Global Namespace, right? The fact that that's already built into the product is massive, right? It already ties together the... on-prem environments to the public cloud with the right policies and frameworks that allow you to kind of provision wherever you want, but you have a consistent data representation layer, which is, you know, that's the hardest part, I think, for a lot of consumers, even in the NetApp days, right? It's great, I can run it in the cloud. It's great, I can run on-prem, but what do I need to do? How do I move an app between the two? You know, if I have, you know, if I want... the wrong redundancy or I want to fail over or, you know, I want to provide an active active architecture. It was almost impossible to do in the NetApp world, right, where I think in the vast case of what we can do today, we could bring that value. We just need to get the infrastructure built right. Makes sense?

[00:11:52.20]  Jason ValleryI think data spaces is the key differentiator as well. It's kind of one of the things that excites me the most coming from the world I was in. When I think about like the architectures. of what OpenAI were doing, their idea and the way they operate today in Azure is they have a central data lake and it's sitting in office storage and it's multi exabytes in size and that central data lake is not adjacent to any GPUs actually, it's adjacent to CPUs and it's got Spark pipelines, Databricks connected up to it, it's got ETL jobs, it's extraction jobs, and it's just got a massive quantity of CPU cores that are processing incoming data and preparing the data for the training runs, and then they have GPUs in like 50-something Azure regions and growing, and they have GPUs in CoreWeave, and they have GPUs in OCI, and they have GPUs in wherever they can find them, and so, what they practically built themselves, I mean, they built this themselves, is a global namespace that says, you know, I can wire up a GPU to a small amount, relatively speaking, of GPU-adjacent storage, and then have that active working set cache, and then the data moves in and out of those central data lakes which are in, like, big hero Azure regions, and I think that pattern And I'm assuming most of our customers will see something like this happen, and data spaces is the key to capability that unlocks that, and you're right, everyone out there in the industry, the only ones that I see that have anything like this, it's Google. Google actually has Anywhere Cash in their platform, but it doesn't let you take their data out of Google. >> Right, right. look outside of Google, like Hammerspace and Weka kind of are trying to pull this off, and so I think Vast is well positioned compared to Hammerspace and Weka, and it's super exciting

[00:13:42.06]   Remoteto me.

[00:13:43.33]  Jason ValleryTell me about Salute, so sales enablement and strategy, what's a day in the life of Rob look like in terms of that role?

[00:13:52.97]   RemoteYeah, so, you know, the challenge that we have here at VAST is getting access to knowledge, right? And what I mean by that is we don't document things very well here. It's a very engineering-led process, which is great, right? We move fast, they build quick, but we don't have well-defined ownership when it comes to content creation, right? So as represented in the field, you know, SEs, you know, how do they get access to the data that they need in order to sell, right, the different solutions that we should sell into? So content is a big problem here, right? We store everything in Confluence. if you're looking across Confluence, you'll find five articles of the same topic with different representation of them, right? So just rationalizing where the data comes from and how it gets documented and rolled out is a big challenge, right? So that's one of the things we're trying to figure out is, you know, who owns, who's got the responsibility for content creation, I mean, I was on a call with Elone and Jeff and Shahar this week, and it was, "All right, this is the marketing role." Well, maybe, depends on what level marketing goes to, right? Is this something that Shahar's team should be doing from a product perspective? Well, maybe, but they're aligned to different products. They don't necessarily connect into a solution, per se, right? They've got a feature owner for NFS, they've got a feature owner for S3, but in a total solution view, right? Are they connecting those things together and then documenting how those elements represent a solution? Well, no. So who does that? Is it, you know, is it Ronan Cohen's team? Who's part of Shahar's group? They're called the solutions team, but do they really do solutions or do they do? technology validation, right? It's kind of what they do, but they're not really then creating the content for go-to-market for a tech team to go provide like a reference architecture on how to go deploy this at a customer or run a proper proof of concept, right? So then we've got Octo, which we've probably already met Andy Pernsteiner, andy runs kind of the field CTO team, which aren't really field CTOs. But what I ran, I ran a field CTO team which were more, you know, evangelists, right? They were more, you know, "Hey, come in." They were the front end, meet with CTOs, right? They were talking about high-level strategy and engagements. You know, there's a handful of people here at VASTA that can do that. That's not really what Andy's team does, andy's teams are deep subject matter experts in very specific swim lanes. Are they responsible for the content creation? Well, it depends on which swim lane. Some swim lanes will do it, some won't. So how do we organize ourselves so that in the big solution areas that are relevant for where we are in our technology these days, that we've got ownership, that someone's creating the correct content that we need. Content's beyond just, "Hey, here's what we're doing." a reference architecture or you know a deployment guide or you know whatever that is it could be I need a demo or I need a lab environment where I can train the people on or you know it's all those different elements that come together that we just don't have well-defined ownership on who's going to go do these things it's very you'll find it's very ad hoc around here right someone will say I need to go do this let me go create it and they'll create it but it's a one-off, and then you get another one off and another one off, right? So there's no structure around that. I think that's one of the things that we're really trying to kind of put a little bit of a wrapper around is how do we create a little more structure so that we're consistent when we invest in these solution areas that we think are relevant, how do we get the right people working on the right things to deliver the things that the field needs to be successful

[00:17:37.83]  Jason ValleryWhat's your take on the field maturity in general, I mean coming from NetApp where they have a pretty substantial and solid field and you've been exposed to others in the industry, what's your take on Vast's field?

[00:17:51.07]   RemoteSo we have a lot of storage guys here, right? For a product that's definitely foundational storage, but it does a lot of other things now, right? at strategically where do we want to be as a where do we think the biggest bang for our buck is a company right right now selling into the big you know these neo clouds has done really well for us and continue doing well right why they're mostly greenfield environments right most people are buying new GPUs they need really good storage we're probably the best bet out there because of you know simplicity at scale right We do really well with these big neoclouds. So that's kind of where the bread and butter for us is. Or traditional HPC environments that wanted something a little simpler, right? So the hedge funds and, you know, the healthcare or life science research environments, right? We've done well in those. So we've got a lot of people that know that. What we don't have is, we don't have a lot of people that can go in the enterprise and start. talking about data platform and AI use cases and how these customers are thinking about it, that's kind of the next wave of it, and if you go into the big enterprise, the challenge you have, you can go sell to that new greenfield, but we're not just a software platform that can just deploy by a software development team, right? That can get a whole bunch of infrastructure that's already owned in that customer and just deploy on top of it, we need to be integrated, right? So it's not only just a software cell, but it's qualifying the hardware, who's going to manage the hardware. We got to get into the data center team, right? So we're a software solution that's tightly integrated into the infrastructure stack, tied into the networking, right? So you've got to have the storage guys and the infrastructure teams. We also need, you know, the platform side of it, the software development side of it. So it's a broad spectrum of challenges that our field team has to take on, especially the SEs. Right?

[00:19:43.13]  Jason ValleryIt's very unique. Have we not recruited anyone in that persona yet? Like, are there nobody, nobody in the field is a app dev, data platform, data scientist?

[00:19:52.99]   RemoteYeah, so we have like Ryan McGinty's team, they work for Jeff, right, they're kind of the platform team, but there's 10 of them, right. So it's a small group, right, we're just launching really good capabilities there, and with a small group, you want to say, all right, you know, when we get, we still need to build a prospect and qualify opportunities from a general purpose sales team, and then you get, when you find a big opportunity, you bring those specialists in that are really more around the design side of it, or the transitional side of it, or if there's a migration capability, or how do I architect from a current state to a future state, right? But you still have to be able to have those first couple of conversations, because we're not going to grow with 10 people, right? You got to use the breadth of the hundred and, you know... 160 sales teams we have out there to really try and prospect and qualify those opportunities, right? So, the other challenge I have with the SE team is, you know, my guys are responsible for installations, right? So, my guys spend a big chunk of their time in data centers, Rack and Stack, software installation, right? A standard installation for us takes everything from Rack and Stack to deploy. it's like a two-week journey, right? So if I've got an SE in a data center for two weeks, coordinating a rack and stack install, well, guess what they're not doing? They're not out there finding the new buyer and selling. So we're trying to drive efficiencies on the back end of that, which is how do we get partners more engaged on installations, right? You know, Reddit would argue that we've got a PS team. and Rob Banga's group and customer success that do installs, there's 10 people, right? So how do you have 10 people do the installs that take literally three or four manpower to do a rack and stack of, you know, inside of a data center? It's not a one man job, right? It's at least, you know, a two to four man job, right? At the end of the day.

[00:21:42.50]  Jason Vallery>> How technical do you have to be to do the rack and stack, isn't it? I mean, I'm being naive here, but you don't have to understand the solution to be able to plug network cables in.

[00:21:50.68]   RemoteNo, the RacketStack is pretty easy, right? It's literally RacketStack and cabling, right, but making sure, like our systems are very specific to how things are cabled up. So one wrong cable or one bad cable can derail you pretty good. I know it sounds subtle, but... it's it happens right I mean it can throw you off a few days and we'll try to figure out what's wrong right so we are so we just built and this is going to show you how we're growing up we just built a partnership program to handle the rack and stack right now we have to pay them that's the downside to it right with the way we originally did it with the ses was oh well they're free labor we're already paying them let's just have them go do it it's "Yeah, but we're trying to grow, you don't want them spending that time doing something we could go pay, you know, for a few thousand bucks, a partner to go do for us, right?" You know, they're going to hire guys at a much lower rate than I'm paying, you know, a pre-sales engineer to go do, right? So that's always been that kind of that give and take of, you know, Red had wanted to maximize how much time SEs are spending. The reality though is as we need to grow more and get more in enterprise, they need to spend more time with more buying centers, right? Selling it in Neo clouds, it's kind of a handful of people you sell to. Selling to a large enterprise, a large financial, a large pharmaceutical, right? You're talking to many, many people to get a solution in place, right? Especially when we may be selling to an AI team that we now have to work with the data team and that has to then... ultimately work with the infrastructure team to qualify the infrastructure, right?

[00:23:18.83]  Jason Vallery>> Yeah, it's an interesting problem space. That's something I've had to deal with in the cloud, but I have watched an entire other part of Microsoft that does with the physical reality of these things. So it's fun to see that in a little bit more tactical way or tangible way here, so.

[00:23:34.37]   Remote>> Well, and we straddle both sides of that, right? I mean, we're like a software. product that we want to talk about being a software product, but we are heavily dependent on infrastructure. So I need my guys in both lenses and straddling both lines. Networking is a skill set I developed every SE against, and it's my background, so for me it was always easy. But for folks that don't really have a strong networking background, right? to deploy high end, low latency, 400 gig fabrics, right? Leaf and spine, leveraging VXLAN with BGP. It's not something you learn overnight, right? And it's not something, if you don't have experience in it, it's not something that's just easy to adopt. So we're still navigating. How do I get an SE organization, you know, assembled in a way that they understand storage, and AI, but they also have a good foundational capability around networking. So it's a pretty broad spectrum of an SE role here at Vast.

[00:24:33.41]  Jason Vallery>> Well, I'll be at Tech Summit. So I'd love to get coffee or something over there and get to know each other even a little bit better. >> That's great.

[00:24:41.95]   RemoteWell, it's great you get to be out. The first question I was going to ask you if you're going to join us for Tech Summit. Tech Summit was like a last-minute approval I finally got from Rennan to do this, which is great. You'll find Rennan doesn't like to spend money, for all the right reasons. But to squeeze out the money I got out of it was, for me, a personal victory in my short time here.

[00:25:02.46]  Jason ValleryWe're going to continue to do this once a year, hopefully. How many people will be there?

[00:25:06.46]   RemoteAbout 200. Yeah, that's that's not cheap. Yeah. Yeah, we're a little over a little over a half a million bucks. Excuse me Oh, yeah, just not just a little over half a million dollars. That's about where it costs So, you know what?
