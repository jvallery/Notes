# 1:1 with Avinash Lakshman, Whale Iptic secure compute platform and potential VAST integration

**Date**: 2025-12-17
**With**: Jason Vallery, Avinash Lakshman

## Summary

Avinash Lakshman presented Whale Iptic's globally distributed secure compute platform for AI agents and Web2 apps, including Icarus (conversational agent) and Cerebrum (trust-aware agent orchestrator SDK). Jason Vallery and Avinash discussed potential alignment with VAST Data storage and GPU infrastructure across hyperscalers and neoclouds, including ideas around secure, verifiable agent execution using distributed ledger technology.


## Action Items


- [?] Send Avinash Lakshman a follow-up email with public links and information about VAST Data's current and upcoming capabilities so Whale Iptic can evaluate integration or roadmap alignment. @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Review the VAST Data public links and capability information and propose potential integration or alignment ideas between Whale Iptic's platform and VAST Data's roadmap. @Avinash Lakshman #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman agreed to maintain communication and continue exploring potential alignment between Whale Iptic's secure compute and distributed ledger approach and VAST Data's storage and GPU infrastructure positioning.




## Key Information


- Avinash Lakshman co-invented the Amazon Dynamo system and created Apache Cassandra.

- Avinash Lakshman presented Whale Iptic's platform as a globally distributed, cryptographically secure compute platform with virtual sandbox environments for AI agents and Web2 applications.

- Whale Iptic's platform includes Icarus, a virtual conversational agent intended to interact with enterprise-grade systems.

- Whale Iptic's platform includes Cerebrum, an SDK for a trust-aware agent orchestrator with fine-grained authorization control and auditability.

- Avinash Lakshman described Whale Iptic's multi-pod architecture running across AWS, GCP, and Azure to reduce disruption risk from a single cloud provider outage.

- Avinash Lakshman described Whale Iptic using a distributed ledger system for data sovereignty and fault tolerance across cloud regions, built on custom BFT consensus algorithms.

- Avinash Lakshman demonstrated a secure LLM management platform that hosts MCP servers and manages LLMs via cloud provider services, including a chatbot deployed on the infrastructure.

- Avinash Lakshman stated Whale Iptic provides secure and auditable interactions using digital signatures and identity-based wallets in the browser, positioning this as beyond traditional TLS-only security.

- Jason Vallery raised a concern about whether a browser agent is necessary for Whale Iptic's security model; Avinash Lakshman responded that the browser agent is minimal and focused on identity management.

- Jason Vallery described VAST Data's vision to move up the value stack by combining VAST storage with an AI agent engine for enterprises with data lakes in hyperscalers and GPUs spread across multiple neoclouds.

- Jason Vallery stated VAST Data sees an opportunity to provide a complete "neocloud in a box" solution to address varying maturity levels of new neocloud providers.

- Jason Vallery stated VAST Data provides storage solutions used for training data and model distribution for large language models at companies including xAI, Tesla, and CoreWeave.

- Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman discussed integrating GPU infrastructure with distributed ledger technology to enable secure, verifiable, and observable agent execution in a global state scenario.

- Avinash Lakshman requested public information on VAST Data's current development status and capabilities to evaluate potential integration or alignment with Whale Iptic's platform.
