# Karl Vietmeier

## Profile

**Role**: Technical specialist / SE/TME (cloud/distributed systems) at VAST Data (Cloud (implied))
**Location**: Inland Empire (near Pomona/Diamond Bar), Los Angeles area
**Relationship**: Internal collaborator

## Open Tasks

- [ ] Work with Karl and dev leads to wire calculator inputs into deployment tooling so customer-facing “available capacity” matches deployed striping for the chosen region/SKU.

## Key Facts

- Karl's youngest son suffered a badly broken leg.

- Ray Coetzee asked Karl Vietmeier to define the expected performance profile for a VAST Azure VoC instance.

- Lior Genzel told Karl Vietmeier that Karl is optional on the follow-up call with Microsoft Azure because Lior plans to block the Azure VoC request.

- Karl Vietmeier is a Cloud Solutions Architect for VAST on Cloud at VAST Data.

- Karl Vietmeier is seeing growing market interest in whether VAST Data supports Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local.

- Karl Vietmeier observes that GDC and Azure Local opportunities often start as cloud opportunities but shift to on-prem team ownership once hardware is involved, creating confusion over accountability and reducing cloud team's visibility into progress and outcomes.

- Karl Vietmeier believes GDC and Azure Local opportunities should be managed through VAST Data cloud product management because cloud PM has the strongest hyperscaler relationships and these solutions are expected to be acquired through hyperscalers and tied to cloud consumption.

- Karl Rautenstrauch is a Principal Partner Enablement Program Manager for Azure Storage at Microsoft.

- Karl Rautenstrauch requested rescheduling the Weekly VAST GTM Meeting during the week of 2026-01-05 because he has an orthopedic surgeon appointment on Monday related to his youngest son's badly broken leg.
