# 1:1 — Jeff Denworth — 2025-10-27

> [!info] Purpose
> Build trust, surface and remove blockers, align on priorities, coach & grow.

## Summary

Jason and Jeff aligned on near-term focus: synthesize a cloud pipeline view and requirements, deepen relationships and product understanding, and prioritize Microsoft while actively developing a Google TPU strategy. OpenAI alignment is deferred until they engage. They discussed pricing/consumption implications and the need to include Brett in that debate. Org moves to support Jason are imminent. Travel and event plans include Tel Aviv (fly on the 21st), Tech Summit (Orlando), and Supercomputing, where Jason will join meetings and set a small-group with Nidhi.

## Key facts learned

- OpenAI alignment session not needed until they engage.
- Cloud priority: Microsoft first; Google TPU partnership seen as a major opportunity.
- Lior focuses on hyperscalers and also has sell-to obligations (e.g., Microsoft AI research/MapFalcon ~16,000 GPUs).
- Morty handles second-tier clouds (e.g., 4Weave).
- On-prem average utilization ~30%; broad consumption pricing could hurt prepaid revenue and trigger tough on-prem conversations.
- Brett is currently anti-consumption (especially on-prem).
- Uniform pricing across cloud and on-prem has advantages.
- Jason is booked for Tech Summit (Orlando) and Supercomputing; Tel Aviv trip planned (fly on the 21st).
- Tech Summit content led by Rob Benoit (Global Sales Engineering).
- Key internal contacts to engage: Shahar, Yancey, Lior, DJ, Morty, Andy Bernstein, Liraz, Daphnas, Eyal Tritle, Noa.

## Outcomes

- Agreement to prioritize building a synthesized pipeline and requirements view across Oracle, Microsoft, AWS, and Google.
- Plan for Jason to draft a pricing/consumption write-up for discussion with Jeff and Yancey.
- Jason to drive Tel Aviv agenda via Shahar.
- Jason to be added to Supercomputing meetings and set a small-group with Nidhi.
- Jeff to move people under Jason’s scope (to be executed imminently).

## Decisions

- Do not run an OpenAI alignment session until OpenAI engages.
- Primary focus: Microsoft; simultaneously invest in Google TPU strategy.
- Lior’s remit: hyperscalers plus sell-to motions; Morty covers second-tier clouds.
- Pricing discussion must include Brett.

[00:00:00.32] Jabra Speak 710: Jason ValleryThat was super strange, so I had it on I had my phone on Do Not Disturb and I didn't realize it went straight to my voicemail. Sorry about that. How's it going? How's DC? That's good. How's it going? How's GC? Uh, that's okay, maybe. Funny old fact from last night, so. I know how that goes. I'll probably say that again tonight. As long as Ndidi's buying, right? Or I guess probably you're buying. No free rides over here. No free rides. much time you have. I have about half a million topics, maybe not that many, but I will start with what's top of mind. Um, nothing, nothing. Wow. I'm a blank slate. I don't know. Let's go. Let's go on your stuff. Okay. So, um, I'll tell you. The more time I spend talking to folks, the more I'm convinced what's really needed is just like an alignment meeting that you participate in, Yancey participates in, maybe Lior, there's probably two. There's probably a OpenAI alignment meeting, and then there's probably a cloud alignment meeting, 'cause I think the topics are. are subtle but different and it feels like to me it is a like just lock us into a room for a day and put a whiteboard in front of us and I can talk through constraints that I see you guys can brain dump historical context on me and we can come out the other side at least aligned on like we want to go and priorities and so forth and I'm kind of desperate to get that scheduled. I know everybody's got ridiculous travel schedules so just thoughts on how we accomplish that. I think we can do some of it if I come and spend a day or two in San Francisco with you if you've got the free time. I don't know who else would bring along to that. So, in general, I don't think there's that session required for OpenAI. Like, what do I mean by this? You know, it's a customer that's going to tell us what they want, and we're going to do it, and it's not that hard. We're not going to do anything until they commit, so they need to engage. Yeah. That's fair. You know what I mean? That's fair. If they don't engage, we're going to have a meaning for nothing. So you know, either we're in it or we're not, and right now I feel like we're not, but that's okay, and, you know, once we get locked in. Everything will start rolling, trust me, that is not a problem, and I think less about account attack strategy and how we sell, and more about the broader workload, the scenario, my key learnings from that, and what that might translate to into how we just approach the cloud. conversation more generally. So that's probably where it feeds into the second conversation of, you know, really it is, how do we strategize the product against cloud primitives and workload characteristics and the sales constraints? So I totally agree that we need to be aligned on this one. Yeah, I don't know the best way to do it. Okay, I mean for me it's like these calls I'm in sometimes I feel like I might be stepping on toes and I don't want to do that just because you know there's so many historical conversations that obviously haven't been part of. So I just want to be careful around all of that and helpful to get you know all that brain-dumped on me before I, you know, dig myself into a grave. So that's kind of what I'm looking for around that. Okay, well, you and I are going to sit down and pick up where they might break up. Cool. So from that lens, what should I block in the calendar? I don't know. I looked at it. I think Lior has very little influence here. He's a seller at the end of the day. His job is to like, you know, set the right meetings with the right people to have the right conversations. He's not going to influence the product strategy. and Yancey, and you will do that. I think we need a lot more work on sales for other people. That's almost a derivative topic to what you're working on. I mean, the thing is he's not. the way that I wanted to and the way that I think the country's capable of doing it, I think that that's the reason it's tough to just, you know, come up with some ideas. Well, coming out of that pricing conversation meeting, I think I've got a better perspective on the constraints. I'll try to write up my thoughts and share it around with at least you and Yancey initially, and then we can disseminate it broader if it makes sense. sense um okay i understand where you're coming from um the challenge is is twofold the first is that we make no money in the immediate and this business is kind of built on So, in some sense, I think, yeah, I understand the market wants it, but most of the customers are also making them commit to the clouds that they work with, right? There's not no forecasting, there's not no obligation. We're talking about two things. One is we're talking about the unit of billing. the other is what we get from the customer at the end of the day, and I think the unit of billing is fine to meter if we want to, but the customer needs to sign up to something that's a reasonably large commit. Does that make sense? I mean, we could take it later, but I mean, my core point there is that there's both models, right? You get a PAYGO model, which is the highest. price and you've got a reserved commitment model which gives you some commensurate discounts in exchange for your commitment and both of those are available to a customer so that they have flexibility in how they think about the problem. The second problem is that if we like consumption across the board and if we get to be doing it in cloud.., and so that's what I can do on prep. You basically fuck up the entire business. Because right now our distance are, you know, maybe 30% utilized on average, and so the second I go, because it's often two things happen. One is I stop getting prepaid, and then the second thing is people have real, real tough conversations. about what they do on prep yeah yeah I get it it's a it's a difficult problem to navigate okay interest of time I also I also think I also think it's there's a luxury of having a common price model between cloud and on prep So if you kind of view it as, okay, customer is committing to us, I don't really care where they deploy, then having uniformity actually helps with that. Yeah. I mean, I have a lot of thoughts, let me write this up, send it to you, and we'll have a just dedicated part of the conversation when we meet next week around this topic, I think. It's definitely, like, it's not even a conversation that could be had without Brett. I can, I can promise you that. Yeah. He's going to be the ultimate vote, and he is, for the most part, anti-consumption, at least on Brexit. Yeah, I mean, it makes sense. I mean, at that point, you're talking about data under management, like the hardware under management versus data. Uh, no, not necessarily. Like, you know, Tesla just uses their own servers. Yeah. A lot of our customers use their own service. CrowdStrike first order was 50 million bucks. Are those systems built? as they go. I don't agree with that hardware statement because more and more we're just moving to commodity notes that I can use for a variety of different products or applications. Next topic on my list is team structure. Like, are there people I should be meeting with? I think you mentioned you were gonna move a few folks over this week. I wanna make sure I'm on top of that, getting to know folks. Is that still in flight? - It is. I just need to do it. I'll do it tonight. - Okay. - I wanna make sure that I don't drop any feathers with this move, and I have general buy-in. I just need to organize it. Okay. Um... Weekly one-on-one... Have you met Morty yet? I'm sorry, what? Say that again? Have you met Morty yet? No, that isn't a name. What's the name? Morty? Morty Guy. Mordecai. What's his last name? Uh, I want to say it's Bloudstein. I could be wrong. There's not many Mordecais in Slytherins. Sure, I'll look that one up. Where does Mordecai currently report? Uh, let's see. It should be in product management, so reordering a bunch of stuff over the next few days, this is what it looks like. Got it. Well, I mean, it's a big way to my next topic, which is like the overall rhythm of business and one-on-ones and, you know, weeklies, monthlies, weekly reviews. monthly with other team members like who's the full set of people I should try and nail down on a weekly basis I kind of got you know Yonty, Lior, DJ probably, who else? I've said this a few times I really need you to digest this one. Shahar is as important. So Shahar for sure, I've got him on my list. Is it appropriate to ask him for a weekly, or is that too much of his time? You'll spend as much time as he needs to, where he gets value out of it. Value is getting you up to speed or getting you the information you need. But yeah, so 100% on shahar. What about like yoga, the sahar alone? Is that a weekly? That's up to you. That's up to you. Okay. You know, in general, most of these people don't love regular meetings. Yeah. They'd rather be tactical. But yeah, well, it's easier to get your gap and the hardest person to get is the loans. It's also probably like one of two escalation managers that we have in the company. Yeah. He's uniquely, he's unique in that he's both a product architect, a CTO, and a support leader, and that takes him into the rabbit hole periodically. Yeah. But, but yeah, you'll get up to the level of regularity that you need. Yeah, I can tell you that these guys are fairly simple, they just want to see customer demand for the platform and you know, they need to see a steady stream of requirements that results in product that ultimately gets sold. >> Okay. Relationships across the cloud providers focused first on Microsoft. Obviously, Lior is well-embedded there. You described him as a sales guy. Go ahead. >> The way that I think about this, your day job is to support them all. The moonlighting you get is with OpenAI and Microsoft. So that's basically the prioritization. But that doesn't mean that if we're having a strategic meeting with Oracle, that you're not going to be part of that. That gets added to your list next, and what Morty is mostly responsible for is the second tier of clouds. Which is, uh, you know, 4Weave and the likes of those organizations. Sure. I think in general, the requirements should converge. Like, you know, 4Weave is getting to be significant on their own, on Nscale and these others will... Consider these if you then there's the overlap right Amazon operates out of lambda Microsoft operates out of poor weave and end scale, etc But Microsoft is absolutely priority For you I don't think Lior gets that luxury, he needs to crack Oracle, he needs to crack Amazon. He's working on stuff that's farther upstream so that there's a pipeline of clouds for you to launch after the fact. Where does Lior think of his own sort of swim lanes and scooters? So is he just hyperscalers? Does he go in and talk to? - Just hyperscalers. - Just hyperscalers. Does he have a counterpart that's focused? - Yes, he also has a-- - Go ahead. - Oh, sorry. He also has an obligation for the cell too. So a good example is Microsoft. I don't know if you thought this one last week about AI research, but they've now engaged-- us to potentially support the 16,000 GPUs that they bought you knew the name of that I could remember. MapFalcon, yeah. So Leo has an obligation to also sell too, like there should be somebody on his team tracking LinkedIn as an example. Sure. - And I mean, sell two would also include like a platform deal with the Foundry team or something like that, I would assume. - I think design wins, but that's still a sell through. - Well, it depends on how you go to market with it. Like if we were to support them under the hood versus if we were to be like a sidecar, but yeah, I agree. I mean, those are the high-level bullets that I had. I'm anxious to get all of the travel figured out in my itinerary for meeting with the team in Tel Aviv. I book travel to go with Tomar the week of the 20... I fly there on the 21st. I'd be there in four days. You know, I think I'll primarily try to drive the agenda through Sahar, and he can help connect in the teams and the right set of sub-meetings within that. Yep. I want to... Go ahead. He's going to want to make sure that you have the right meeting set up beforehand. It's good to get in the rhythm with them as soon as you can. Yeah. Really having a one-on-one is not the first time that it's all of you. Right. Exactly. I have had a chat with him, but I'll reach out to him today and try to get something on the calendar in the next couple of days just to kind of sync on all of this and figure there. I want to spend time with Yonsi in a similar way like to what I think you and I can do next week. I'm going to Iceland probably the second week of December. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just gonna go for a day. You know, I'm just a cheerleader in this case. Yeah, okay. Well, I'll line it to match you on that in terms of visiting every person. Let me talk to Yazi because he's coming out. He's in the U.S. quite a bit over the next couple of weeks. I don't know if there's another way for us. to get in the same room together, but I'll talk to you on that. Maybe. If he's coming to New York, like, you know, get his travel plans, maybe we can all get together. Yeah. I am booked for the Tech Summit thing, so I'll be there in Orlando for the whatever that is, four days, I think. Yeah, so we'll get some time there, too. Um, high level, like, you know, obviously today is week one, um, so there's a lot, yeah, great. Oh, what can I, uh, you know, where do I prioritize my areas of focus? Because there's all these different things going on, like, if you were to rank order everything we just discussed, how do I spend my time to make sure I'm moving things forward from your perspective? - Well, first of all, I'm not like a, I think you can tell this already, I'm not like a micromanager by any stretch of the imagination. I think what I'd like to see, like to see is, what's the pipeline of business that we got for each cloud? And are we building the right thing to go and capture that pipeline? And I don't think anybody's ever really synthesized this in a way where we understand a lot. customer requirements yada yada yada so as a result you know some just the organization of the business is probably the first good step but that'll help you get your head around everything that's going on and when I say cloud I mean all four major platforms Oracle, Microsoft, AWS, Google. Google's getting quite interesting in that we're trying to partner with them on the TPU side and that that'll be like massively disrupted for the market I think. So if I was to put the investment on Microsoft I would probably put it on Google only because they're going to war with NVIDIA, and for us to be the thing that is between them in this war would be outstanding. Don't you worry though that Google has the most mature first party storage offering for these scenarios and it's going to be harder to compete with Google themselves? I do worry about that, and I also know... A few things, the first is they have been unsuccessful at building a file system. They bought lots of files, they, you know, they're just, they're struggling there now. Object storage is more and more relevant to AI, it's going to be a tougher battle. put that to rest the fight. But secondarily, they're also starting to ship CPUs outside of GCP. - Yeah. - And this is like a massive opportunity for us to be the platform that they partner with, and so I think we have to make this work, and as they ship them remotely, they're not going to ship the full Google stack, and so a huge open opportunity for us. Yeah, no, I agree. That's just an N-scale, Nebbias, whatever, long tail of data center providers. But the conversation starts, right? Less than a Google cart. You know, the-- Yeah. The-- The-- team loves us, and that's how that starts. You know what I mean? We just need to crack in the dam and then we can exploit it. Yeah, okay. Uh, well, lots to think about. I'm spending my time right now just trying to build relationships. I mean that is kind of my first priority. I think understanding the product and the architecture is equally important. Yep. So reading as much documentation as you can. Yep. If you don't understand the product and the various constraints, that's when you lose the respect of the R&D team because you don't appreciate the relative nature of your app. That's so I think I'm getting there but I agree that is also an area of focus is to make sure that I'm technically competent and being able to speak authoritatively with an understanding of how it all works, looking forward to texting you. Yeah, right. Well, to be comprehensive it's difficult but yeah. like, you know, design implementation, and so the white paper is like, you know, 101 in that journey that you need to take to understand it, but really it's confluence and the documentation that's most important. So I'm hoping that one of the engineers can kind of give you a guide to how that I was taking a SOP actually, and that's why I teed that one up, and you get a shitload to read, like an absolute shitload. How good is the content that gets presented at Tech Summit? Is that like? It's the first one ever done, I have no clue. Who's driving the collateral, the content? It's a guy named Rob Benoit, he runs, he runs global sales engineering. Yeah. I have no clue, I know I have to speak and I don't even know what to talk about, so. Talk us. Because that's a question. Running couldn't go, so they wanted some suit to come in and just give the ra-ra. You consider yourself a suit? I thought you were more of a vest. I'm wearing a vest right now. You seem to- every picture I've seen you in, I think you're wearing a vest. Uh, I like vests, by the way. No dig there. I wear vests all the time. Uh... Yeah, I mean, I'm a running vest. It's standard uniform. It is. Like, flannel shirt with a vest. It's how we roll. Um... Supercomputing is the last thing I guess- I'll bring up. I'm going to be there. I would like to fill my agenda with useful meetings. I can certainly make one-on-ones, but if there's customer conversations or things that are happening, how do I plug into those so I can at least be a fly on the wall and maybe add value you where I can? So the way supercomputing works... is the team goes and books a shitload of meetings, and then I, a few days before, assign technical people to those meetings. So that comes from knowing the customers and largely knowing what needs to be done, and so, you know, I can just add you to whatever. You can just add yourself once you set this up. I think you need to give it another leap. for two, see what meetings get lined up, but we'll have something in the order of 400 or so scheduled that week, and there will be no lack of things for you to sit at home. Okay. It'll be a hundred times better than Ignite would be for us. Sounds good. I mean, taking that same question up a little bit higher level, what other meetings kind of go on Either the customers or just more broadly in the rhythm of business around here that I may or may not have on my calendar already Like I don't know what I don't know in terms of which meetings to plug into at this point So I think that question needs to be answered by Don C. Okay You need to start making your yourself present and Visible on Slack, you know, engaging in cloud deployment conversations, the cloud channel is kind of quiet, but those guys will tell you what the meetings are happening. I'm largely meeting with customers and it's never really about the platform, it's about that, so I'm a bad. foxy for that yeah so just on the slack conversation are there specific channels you have in mind because i have followed what i think are the right set but they are pretty dormant chats and uh there's there's some that are like ultra vibrant as well um so like there's a there's a sales guys that was invented because of me. Pre-sales, the pre-sales channel. You know I talked to Andy Bernstein. Have you met Andy? No, but I would have been on a meeting with him just now if I hadn't talked to you because there's a CTO meeting apparently right now and he runs that I think. Yeah, so Andy will tell you precisely the genus that you should Okay, I'll set up a one-on-one with Andy as well. I'll just kind of meet him and introduce myself. He's an amazing person. One of my favorite people. So, you should definitely have a chat with him. Cool. Well, I think that is time. Any other things you want to chat about? No. I feel like you're fishing for a first week review. No. you're doing a great job no no no no you know i mean i do like feedback i am you know you'll find as we work together like i always want to know that i'm keeping the boss happy and doing the right things but you know obviously after our first week i think you've probably heard from enough people that i'm not shy so um you'll know you'll know when i'm not happy but you're doing great uh yeah i know i know necessarily looking for a review. I just want to make sure that I'm doing the right things and I'm not, you know, off in the weeds on something that doesn't matter and I'm getting it done. So yeah. No, but having a very open conversation about what it looks like for Shahar would be super helpful. Okay, and then, you know, obviously getting into the right group of people, if you're not getting added to the New York Yeah, I mean definitely those guys have been starting to make pull me in the meeting So I was looking for feedback on love if there's anything beyond what we were in yachts here manages Are you he knows? Okay, so the other people you should also meet is LeRoz, L-I-R-A-Z. Okay, and Daphnas. They're both like program managers that work within R&D, and then there's one other, well there's two others, there's It's kind of a change of guard. So there's kind of like an internal PM function within R&D, and Tomer should have told you about a guy named Eyal Tritle. - Yeah, he mentioned him. - Okay, so you should talk to Eyal, but Eyal is, I think Eyal's gonna be moving into a new role now. Don't tell him that if he doesn't already know. But there's another woman named Noah, N-O-A. that is coming back after being on the sabbatical and she'll be taking over more internal deals. Okay. So yeah, I would definitely also be close to those people. Okay, I think you gave me a list. How are you going to go about talking to them? And I think that the biggest question for all of them is, how can I help it? Yeah. I appreciate that. Okay. I got to go. Appreciate you, Jeff. Enjoy the rest of your week. Feel free to reach out if you have anything and I'll get going on talking to all these folks. I think we need to get back on the cloud sales. We need to figure out a way to get Niddy super, super pissed off about this. Otherwise, we need a few champions now that understand the relative cost of partnering or not partnering with Vax, um, to find some of the stuff that you're going to. Well, I want to understand your goals with pissing off Niddy. Are you saying you want her to be on our side? pissed off but there's not a better solution. 100%. It needs to know, it might be very tempting. I mean, it's the economics of it, right? Like, there's a clear pitch to make, which is the reduction in racks, the reduction in power, the increase in performance, and a comparison matrix that shows some vast hardware. Vast on L-series and Azure native solutions. >> Right. I want to say, here's the GPUs you could have sold. >> Right. Yeah. Divide that by megawatts per rack times whatever GB200 requires and say, this is the extra capacity you would have been able to deploy in your data center. Rounding costs when you look at the storage difference. Rounding error with the upside of $300 billion of sales, that they could have made and not sent to fucking Netscape, and performance benefits. Like even setting all of the commercials aside, like it's a better experience for the customer's workload. Yeah. Well, that has a flip side, which was, you know, the slower their GPUs are, the more they have to sell. until somebody figures it out. - Depends on the scenario and workload, but yeah, I'm with you. No, I think that makes sense. Like, I do want to put together that table. The challenge with sharing it back to NITI is like, it's containing Microsoft confidential information in a sense, right? Like, I know the numbers of how many racks they'll save, but like... yeah that's a that's a conversation with me it's like the Sam Hopewell thing what can i what can i know at best yeah yeah by the way Sam was very open with that topic like i had that i mean Sam doesn't work there anymore so it doesn't matter but he's he was very fine he's like whatever you want to know about like the workload is fine it's the commercials and pricing that they would care about but you know sure sure But I view that as apples and oranges, so I don't worry about that. Okay, well let's get to that same place where we can have real conversations with people that care about selling within Microsoft. Yeah, it would be good if we, while we're at supercomputing, do you have a small group meeting with Nidhi and maybe, I don't know, Jack on her team or someone? Let's set it up. Yeah. Let's set it up. That's on you. - See, you just added another thing to your list. Okay, I really gotta go. - Okay, bye Jeff. - Bye.
