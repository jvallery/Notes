## Key Facts

- Jonsi Stefansson shared a presentation for editing

- Jonsi Stefansson works at Vast Data.

- Jonsi Stefansson (jonsi@vastdata.com) shared a Google Slides presentation titled "GCP Flow from customer to sales to customer.pptx" and granted edit access to Jason Vallery.

- Jonsi Stephenson raised a concern that describing cold data as tiered to Azure Blob using VAST object format may be undesirable because data stored in VAST object format would not be readable directly from Azure Blob.

- Jonsi Stephenson suggested reconsidering the cold data tiering description to use native Azure Blob format for ecosystem accessibility and direct readability from Azure Blob.

- Jonsi Stephenson asked whether the document should make a firmer statement that VAST unique data reduction and efficiency features reduce exposure to flash supply-chain constraints.
