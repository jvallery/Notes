# 20251030 1000 Parallels Transcription

**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Participants:** JB, Rob, Dre, Stacy, Jeff Moeller, Andrew Stack, Andy, Tim, Paul, Parker, Travis

## Summary

Weekly SE community call covering end-of-quarter push, Tech Summit logistics, and UserCon attendance drive. Tech Summit agenda email is going out, hotel confirmation emails due by next Tuesday, and evening events are set. Strict expense policy reiterated: no expenses outside official events. SE Toolbox debuted with Jeff Moeller’s Port Mapper, a Python-based GUI that automates switch port mapping, config generation, Lucidchart overlays, and planning for converged/split networking with bandwidth validation. Tool supports NVIDIA/Mellanox, Cisco, and Arista, JSON import/export, and legacy install command generation; no IPv6 support yet. SEs asked to drive UserCon registrations for already-sold tickets; a dashboard will be shared.

## Key facts learned

- Community size ~175; ~50 on the call
- End of quarter with big deals in flight; ‘end of Q3’ noted
- Tech Summit in two weeks
- UserCon registration status: 19 registered; ~40 tickets sold; ~100 more tickets expected to close in the next few days
- Dashboard to show ticket sales/registrations will be shared
- Tech Summit evening events: Day 1 reception; Day 2 OPA (tavern); Day 3 Sportsplex gaming event with prizes
- Strict expense policy: no reimbursement for spend outside official events
- Port Mapper tool: switch selection (NVIDIA/Mellanox, Cisco, Arista), cell planning, per‑rack bandwidth validation, JSON import/export, Lucidchart PNG overlays, VPN-enforced latest switchconf, legacy install command generation
- Cisco ASIC slice balancing and Arista physical port order handled
- No IPv6 support in Port Mapper
- Do not plug clients into southbound switches; use networking field requests for design help

## Outcomes

- SEs directed to engage customers to convert sold UserCon tickets into registrations
- Tech Summit agenda email to be sent; hotel confirmations due by next Tuesday
- SE Toolbox series launched; first session delivered featuring the Port Mapper tool
- Reminder to use the networking field request process for architecture guidance

## Decisions

- Introduce SE Toolbox segment approximately monthly

## Risks

- Low UserCon registrations versus target may impact event success
- Expense misuse could jeopardize future event approvals
- Ambiguity in networking terminology (converged/split/unified) may lead to mis-architecture (e.g., clients on southbound switches)
- Port Mapper lacks formal version control and IPv6 support
- Auto-config generation depends on VPN connectivity; offline requires manual steps

## Open questions

- What is the exact UserCon registration target and by when?
- Will a clear decision guide be published on when to use converged vs. split networking and MLAG boundaries?
- Will IPv6 be supported in Port Mapper, and what is the timeline?
- Where will Port Mapper code be hosted for version control (e.g., GitHub)?
- Is an SCO session for Port Mapper approved and scheduled?
- When will the ticket sales/registration dashboard be available to SEs?
- Will Port Mapper integrate with the sizing tool and site-survey tooling?

[00:00:22.56]   Remote(silence) And back. It's crazy. We have 22 people right at the top of the hour and I remember when we didn't have 22 people on the call at all. It's great. How many do we have total? There should be hundreds if they had time. I think it's about 175. just under 175. Wow that's wow amazing. Growth is good. That is CRT in the back here view there Travis. Of course it is. Of course. What do you do on that run at VBS? Yeah. It looks funny next to an ultra-wide, doesn't it? That's his heater for the room. That, and I got a plasma that heats our bedroom in the winter with our 65-inch Panasonic. Full 600 watts on the wall. Jesus, it'll pull the frame down. It's for retro PC gaming, and I don't know, some modern stuff. looks cool when I do. It's the bubbly effect. Get the bubble glass tube. Nice. Yep. I like to dabble. Different things. >> JB, we can't hear you, you're talking. >> Yeah, I was noticing the same thing. >> You're not on mute, so I think your, yeah, your microphone's not connected. >> Yeah, that's right, he's off mute, but no sound. >> Test, test, what about now? - There we go. - There you go, man. You guys hear me now? - Yep. - Yeah. - All right, cool. All right, we're at the top of the hour. Three minutes after the hour, we got 40 plus participants. We'll go ahead and get started. Welcome everybody, SE community. Go ahead and get started with our weekly updates. a few speakers today. We'll start off with Rob and then we'll next go to Dre and then we'll have Jeff Moeller talk after that. So I'll turn it over to you, Rob. Yeah, thanks, JB. Hey, happy end of Q3, everybody. Last week of the quarter. Always an interesting time to be on a call, but I know you guys are hitting it pretty hard. A lot of big deals still in the pipe for the quarter. So a lot of people, we're real busy getting some stuff in. So not too concerned, we got 50 people on the call. That means that the other 100 plus are closing business, which is a good thing. Just a couple of things, we got Tech Summit in two weeks. I can't believe it's two weeks away. It feels like we just got the approval for this thing yesterday. So we're heavy on getting it together. some of you folks on this call are participating and helping us put this together. So I, you know, an early thank you to all the work that's been done so far. I think it's going to be a great event. I'm super excited about it. So hopefully, you know, after we, you know, take a breath after this week, we kick off the beginning of Q4 with a good tech summit, the next discussion, which is right around the corner, it's gonna happen just as quick as Tech Summit's coming. We've got SCO and UserCon. So, a couple of things on UserCon. We are starting to sell some tickets, and you know, the responsibility of the SEs, right? Certainly from a leadership perspective. is once we sell those tickets, you know, you guys got to spend some time with your customer to get them to register, right? You know, talk about, I know we've been a little bit light on the agenda so far, all that information is gonna come out the very near term, but really, you know, sit down with your customer and convince them to come. Just 'cause we bundled tickets into a deal doesn't mean that we've got someone lined up to join us. for the event. So if you need help or someone to help convince your customer, you want to have a conversation, I am always open to do that. I can give them an update on what they're going to experience is going to be like and what they're going to learn. But, you know, it's really the job of this team to help drive that attendance, right? The AEs get those tickets sold in the of the deals or, you know, part of the. the transaction we do with the customer, or sell them directly to partners or through partners, but we need to kind of step up and help close that. So just a little bit on the number side of it, right? We've got 19 people registered so far, which is light. I think we thought we'd be at least triple that number by now, but we do have an additional like 40 tickets that have been sold. So that's a few folks who sold tickets. We're gonna get a dashboard out to everybody so you can see who sold and who didn't sell. Another 40 tickets that are already closed, right? So that's 40 customers we need to have engagements with, and then right now, of course, at the end of the quarter, we've got another 100 tickets that are gonna be closed and opportunities over the next couple of days, right? So it's going to get pretty hot and heavy pretty soon as far as the activity of what we need to do to get customers in seats as part of those deals. So my ask to this group is make sure you understand your work with your AEs about what was in those deals. I'm sure you guys already have line of sight to it. If they have a ticket and they've got the ability to go, let's start trying to convince them to register, right? So, and don't be shy. If you need anyone to help you, whether it's myself, Dre, JB, you know, your SE leader, whoever it is, let's get some folks there. The expectation is we get a couple hundred customers and partners there. It's going to be a great event. So it really is worthwhile. Our first time doing this to really open the door. doors, you know, certainly the inside doors to vast the customers and not just in the executive briefing or, you know, in the touch points we have in their site, this is a chance to really expose them to the whole company. I think that's something that other companies do, you know, as an advantage on their side, whether it's, you know, Dell or NetApp or Pure, you know, hosting those big. annual events drives opportunities, right? It drives awareness. It makes your customers feel more like they're part of the company, right? They're a tighter partner. So let's make sure that we're trying to create that same experience in this first year of running our first Unicon, right? We're not expecting thousands of customers like you do at those bigger events, but we do want a good amount. We want a couple hundred customers there. you know, that we can share that experience with and really, you know, open the doors and get them, you know, tighter inside of what we're doing from an innovation perspective. But also there's going to be a lot of hands-on capabilities that we're going to, we're really going to work with them to show them how they can maximize their either current investments or future investments with VAST. So you know, like I said, we'll be sending some reports out on where we are with it, but really the goal is to get customers registered, get them to the event, and then use that as a huge accelerator to spend more time with them. So that's it for me, JB, over to you. Thank you, Rob, and I would like to also thank, again, if I have guys on the call that's helping put together the event. a big thank you. This is going to be great. Next, I'm going to turn it over to Drake. He has some announcements that he wants to present. Yeah, it's a small round, more Tech Summit stuff. So, you guys will be receiving an email today that is going to like lay out the agenda, some details of the agenda. I know you guys have been asking and wanting for it. It's confirmation emails for hotel verbiage is being fixed on the confirmation emails now. I just got confirmation before this call that those confirmation emails will be out no later than next Tuesday. We shall be getting back the confirmation to review it today. We'll review it, send it back, then they'll start sending it out. So you may see some over the weekend, you may see some tomorrow, but no later than next Tuesday is what we're being told, and that's all I, oh, well, evening events. There's the reception the first night. The second night, we'll be at OPA. It's a tavern, and the third night, we will be at a place called Sportsplex. Reason why I'm letting you know this because we want to let you know that we are having a gaming event the third evening. It's going to be a lot of fun. So there's going to be like sign up sheets, and the winner will win something. I won't tell you what it is now, because I don't want to jinx it for those that might really want it, and plus, I like to have surprises. Yeah, so those are the evening events, and you should see your details in the email today. all I had. Stacy came here so I know she want to say something. I wanted to come and be the bad guy just for a moment and I just listen it's gonna be communicated out I just want we have a very specific budget for this event. I will feed you. I will give you alcohol. We will sing. We will dance. We will have fun. We will learn. We will network. We will do all of the things. If you choose to leave my evening events and go buy your friend a drink, which you can, I love that for you. Please are not expensive because it will be denied. One more time. for those in the back of the room. - Why is Stacey on the AC call? - I don't know. - What did she get on here? - You know, I don't know. Listen, expenses outside of those for the event, they're not included. I just, I know that is, mute her. Thank you, Parker. I think that said to me a lot. I don't know why that is. - I should talk to my therapist about that. But listen, there was a lot of approvals that went into this. There was a lot of people that worked really, really hard to get this done, and I want to make sure that we get to do this next year, and so I think it also is part of our brand, right? Of the reason why we deserve this event as a thief, and I, when I say we, I'm just an honor. even though you guys know I don't know anything, and I just want to be very clear with the expense policy, right? It's already emailed out. It's on the site. It's going to be emailed out to you again. I just don't want you to get into a situation where we had someone last year who bought $3,000 worth of drinks for people and then wanted to know why expense did not want to reimburse them, right? Please don't be that person. Buy your friend a drink. Please have a good time. that after the evening events, it's on your own dime. That's it. That's why I'm here. I told you I was the bad guy. But I do it with a with a smile. So it's not so bad. Right? Bad cop, and Jeff Moller. Moller. Yes. Swimming in the Koi pond is approved. So, enjoy yourself. If you kill one of those Kois, those are very expensive, I will come for you. You better just cradle it, okay? Just cradle that Koi, please. Okay, I'll cradle it as long as it gets approved in the expense report. No, you're not going to kill it. You're not going to kill it. Thank you. That's it. Thanks, Dre. Sorry. I should have told you I was coming. No worries. All good. But she's very serious about that expense thing. It's a real thing. So please, if you are going to try to expense anything, do a tech summit. It will not get approved, and if you care about everybody else and you want to have this event again, Don't do it, it's really that simple, all right? All yours, JD. That also includes bubble gum, yep, all right, that was, all right, um, thank you, Stacey and Dre. Um, all right, so now we're gonna go on to our next session. So this is gonna be kind of new, uh, with the, uh... weekly updates. We'll do probably once a month. We're going to call this the SE Toolbox. So today I have Jeff Moeller. He's going to come on to talk about his tool that he has created that is used in the field to help him and others in this region and others who know about the tool to help solve some problems, and that's pretty much the gist of the SE Toolbox. We'll invite you SEs and the SE community, if you do have any ideas or anything that you're using, tools you created, things that you think that will help out the field, your field brethrens, you know, please feel free to reach out, and we're looking to do it like once, once maybe. you twice a month, give you some time to talk to the community about the tools that you have. So without further ado, I'll give Jeff Moeller some time. We don't have any other set of, one else lined up after this. So I'll give Jeff Moeller a time to go through his Port Mapper tool and I'll go ahead and turn it over to Jeff. All right. Hey, thank you, everybody, and thank you very much, James, for your time. I'll go ahead and share my screen. in here. So, uh, three or four months ago, a friend of mine, new hire, challenged me with, uh, me complaining about, "I hate drawing, I hate drawing poor maps," and then putting them into Lucid. It just takes so much time to come up with a pretty picture of what plugs into where, and how to put together a visual map. of a switch and then going through the install plan and getting all your variables straight and a valid switch, switch, switch config. So I challenged myself to drop in the cursor and write a tool that can create switch configs. So if you do a search on the field portal and do a search search for uh switchconfig. switchport mapper, you'll get to this page, and we'll take you through a basic user guide of how to use it, and what we'll do is I'll talk about how do you install it. There's a link down here at the bottom, portmapper.zip. We'll drop into your system, and type whenever one's watching, turn your heads. So unzip. There's not a lot to do to install it. Take a look at the install file. It's going to require a couple of small packages for Python. Install it into a virtual environment if you're a power user. Otherwise, you can use this break system packages. It's just a cover-all warning from Python. but it's not going to break anything on your system. It's just a warning that you're overriding OS installed packages, and that's fine. So once you get this installed, you're going to run the port mapper. The first time you run it, it will take a few moments, and probably the shining feature in this tool is every time you come to the setup page, it will provide you an excuse for your is late so you know who you are we've all been there but now you have an excuse but now that you've done that you're gonna come into here the first thing you're gonna do is select the switch that you want to map for it defaults to a Mellanox 400 gig and it will give you a visual confirmation of selecting any of the switch you want so whatever you want to do you just select that switch from here. I will put in the new Arista 24 port switch this week or this weekend and if you hit W on the confluence page you'll watch it and I'll update that page when I get that switch in there. On the setup page it provides you some default variables for everything you need to create a switch config. switch host names, customer names, site name, cluster name, the OS you want to use depending on which which you select, some basic IP information, and you can enter in other variables you need like customer VLANs, put them in here, BGP ASNs, you can drop them in here. If you're going to use the second NEC and use converged networking where you bring your northbound second NEC ports into the same switch, select use converged networking and I'll show you how that works, and if you say my design says I need 300 gigabytes per second per rack, I'll show you have the system goes through and tries to audit that to make sure you have the same configuration. So once you have all this data entered into here, you assign your switch and you go into your cell planning. So let's say I want to build a, I want to build a 10 by, a 10 by 12. So the first thing that's very important here is We count nodes into a cell fabric. We don't count boxes, we count nodes. So a Series V2 or a Mavericks has two cables per fabric for each D-tray, and so the total for five D-boxes would be 10 nodes, okay? And then 12 D-boxes because there's one, can switch. I can go ahead and split that down and carry that through. I need two IPLs. I'm going to connect it to spines. I'm going to connect it to customer switches with, I don't know, eight ports each. So this is going to go through and it's going to order everything the way engineering wants to D-nodes first and then C-nodes and then IPLs, external ports and then C-nodes and then N or E-box ports from northbound will be assigned as uplink ports as well. So those will automatically be added to the configuration. If you were using the second net but not converged networking, those will come out. So for now, I'll go ahead and leave those in here, and you will always get a live preview of what the switches look like as you build the configuration live. If you go, "Oh, I selected the wrong switch," you can select a different switch, and it will change the configuration of the switch when you do that. So we'll stay back on the 400 gate because that's where we're going. restarted and so that's what you do here so since you've sold something into a giant quota busting csp you need 10 of these racks so i'm going to call it leaf rack type type leaf i'm going to hit go i now have 10 racks of this design and i'm per rack, the host name by rack number, and the IP addresses that we started with on the setup page. Now, the incrementing of the host names and IPs may not match what you're actually doing with the customer, so you will have to come in and edit these one at a time, but it's still infinitely faster than creating all of these by hand, and again, you get it you get a representation of what every switch looks like that you can put into your planning and send to the customer and make them go, "Wow, you did that! That was so fast!" So let's say you want to convert some spine switches at the same time. Let's come back into here. I can't type. Let's call it a spine rack. Let's get rid of my nodes because I don't have nodes into my spines. I do have a couple a couple of those I do those and I'm connecting to I'm connecting to I'm connected to 10 10 leafs each with uh with three ports each okay and my customer uplinks are going to be to two spines on the customer side with uh i don't know 10 ports each now it's put everything together but i can separate these to create some some pretty space in the middle between the two i can say i want my external ports to start at port 20 and everything assigns down for up on ports because everything's assigned from right to left and everything everything on C nodes and D nodes, everything counts from left to right. So you can create that separation in there, and I want a total of, I don't know, two racks of those, so I'll create two more racks, two more cells, and now I've got some spine racks in here too. You can come into here and you can edit a spine rack, any rack, and say, well, This last one in here, I've only got 3D boxes and two nodes. So that rack will be different. So when I've done all this and I've done all my planning, and I can take an existing rack and I can clone it, and I can come into here, and then I can also remove it. Or I can add a new rack, or I can select multiple racks or I can take a rack and I can move it around in the order. Whatever you want to do that that's available for you to do that. Once I come into the output I see my final output and I can look at all of my racks. When I do that if I hit generate overlays it's going to create all the png files that I can put into Lucidchart. Okay done I'm going to create a json companion. I'll show you what that does later you're going to like that and when I'm all done I can come over here this is supposed to say create switch configs I don't know why it doesn't but you do that you hit a button and if you're connected to VPN you instantly get all your switch configs if you get any errors then let me know but you shouldn't be allowed to do anything in the switchport mapper invalid. Any questions so far? No, just a comment. Looks pretty cool. Awesome. Thank you. So once you have all this done, you have a project directory and we'll go take a look at that. Here's your projects directory. Here's your customer name, your site name, your cluster name. Your design output has every rack and every picture that you need for every rack. It also contains your JSON file, which I'll show you how to use in a moment. The switch output contains the config file. file for every rack, and this is what this looks like. This will contain the exports that you put into your install plan and the command line that was used to create the configuration. If you're not connected to VPN, the tool will not create a configuration because it is strictly aligned with whatever is published at that moment on the engineering. site but if you're offline you need to create this in the field and you can't connect to vpn you should have switch config up to date on your laptop and if you look in the directory where you are it will be here already and then you can run this by hand you can literally cut and paste this entire this entire output into your terminal on that directory and get your switch configs. It's just the difference between my tool may be making a mistake and having the wrong version and maybe you have the wrong version. So if you're not on VPN, you can run this yourself. If you are on VPN, this will do it for you. It'll pull down the latest SwitchConf Pi, right? Every time you're on VPN? Every time you hit the button... which configs, it downloads a fresh, a fresh copy. So, so if you hit the button and it creates configs and then you reach VPN and come back five minutes later, hit the button, it will not. But it's on the desk, you can do it yourself, but you'll have to run it manually. - Awesome. - Okay, so, so, so. So it's enforcing that, yes, you have the current version of Switch Perfect. Now, if you have your JSON file saved somewhere, like in your install plan, and you want to come back and start over, we can come in here and we can import our JSON file. Let's go find it here. PortMapper project. customer site, cluster name, design output. It's going to tell you what you're going to do. You're going to say, yep, looks good to me. It's going to apply everything and you're going to be done. You're going to have every rack as you defined it in the system and then you can run from there. there you can edit, you can do whatever you want. So, why did I do this? Again, I got tired of drawing pictures, so I wrote a tool. I started out command line, I turned it into a GUI, and I can't write a single line of code, but I've got 10,000 lines of Python that run this for me, and I'm really happy with it. I don't think I've missed anything. I was waiting for the infamous wait, there's more. Oh, no, I don't think I have a wait, there's more for this one. Um, also, yeah, I think I just went through everything. it's gone through a lot of iterations as I'm not a UI expert, I definitely don't write code, but I'm kind of happy where it's at and as engineering matures, switch config, this will mature with it. I can tell you that the QA department is happy with this. Yeah, thank you. thank you yeah uh mr mr stack stack has spent a lot of time doing uh doing qa on this and that's where he has used this to generate what probably would take hours of time to generate content here and put into his confluence pages actually that's looks like it's out of date so that i i switched the images over to the Arista switches, but yeah, yeah, I'm sure you did. Very useful for cabling. There is a disconnect between like, you know, the way Muller, and if you get the labels, are different than you actually, like, maybe you're labeling, you're naming or labeling. All to say, like, there's... What you have in front of you is essentially helpful for getting the thing cabled, and it may not necessarily be the description for your port map. Those are two independent actions, right? Does that make sense to everyone? Yes, yeah. - So this is not a cable mapping tool. This is building a cell, and then you can use the visuals to go out and build your labels and plan your cabling. I want to turn this into a table label submission tool, but I'm not there yet. I'm close, but I'm not there yet. So, the one thing I did want to show some people, if you're working with Cisco switches, switches have a design called, um, um, Oh, it just left my head, but they split up slicing. They split their ASICs into performance by eight fork groups on a switch. So I've selected a 64 port Cisco switch. I'm going to say I have nine D boxes. C boxes, a couple IPLs, and I'm uploading to two customer switches with four ports each. So it looks like a mess, right? But let me back out of this and show you what it's actually doing. So with Cisco slicing their best practice. is to assign ports, let me clear it and start over, is assign ports at the top of the cell for end devices, for nodes. So there are eight port slices in here and it will do its best to balance workload for downstream ports like c nodes and d nodes one one each starting at the lowest port number okay for uplink ports it's going to order them from the bottom of each shell counting up and that's how they want people to achieve balance across their switches. Usually it's a mess, but it is by Cisco best practices, and this counts for 32 and 64 port switches. I know that'll be confusing, but when you see it working, it makes sense. I've got. Did you go over like the per rack bandwidth stuff? No, I did not. I did not. So, let me go back and do a simple switch here. Let's say I want 400 gigabytes per rack. So, I'm going to enter 400 gigabytes here. I have my switch. I have. I'm just going to put in numbers here, eight and eight, and so what this is saying here is you see this little suggestion. If I want to make sure that this leaf switch has enough bandwidth to provide non-blocking throughput one of the leafs dies, it tells me how many ports I need per channel group to achieve that throughput. If I don't meet that value, it'll warn me I don't have that value, and that's what that does, and then if you're gonna say, this also goes to a spine, for example, it tells me how many I need for that. but if I'm connected to four spines I need fewer ports and if you do something so like over assign the switch it'll warn you that you've done that and you have a chance to fix it. If you say I want to create some spacing between my c's and d nodes I can start my cnode somewhere else I can say start that at 21 and say I want to reserve ports 12 ports here and 12 ports here so visually in your design you can show your customer that I know we're going to grow and I've reserved additional port capacity on the switch. The switch config app will also configure those ports for you, so all you have to do is walk up to the switch and plug in a cable when you grow that system. So you can plan that into the tool as well. Do you have to put the assigned ports and the... reserve port count to get that spacing like that, or if you put the reserve port count and don't have the sign port, is it going to try and stomp on each other? Yes. Yes. Okay. No, no. It's, it's, it's, it's cognizant of what you've done there. Okay. All right. It's just, I did the reserve port first by hand just to see how many that have free, for example. Yeah, but if I didn't have this here at all, then yeah, then those are reserved and I put in eight more of those and that's there, and then populate. Okay. Move. It knows and moves them out. Yep. Yes. It knows the preferred order from D's, C's, then E's, B's, C's, E's, I's, and G's, EBOX, Insight, Engine, GPU nodes. soon to a to a product near you we're going to have gpu nodes and then isl's external ports and northbound converge c node and ebox ports um i will clear this up by getting rid of that and say i've got eight i've got six eboxes then it will give you eboxes and it will give you northbound ebox ports as well it works this assume it because you've told it I am using the second NIC and I am using converged networking. I couldn't think of any reason you'd have some C nodes using the second NIC and some not. So it just assumes they're all going to be in plan. Quick question for when you were balancing across the ASICs before. - Will that actually apply to the switch configuration? - Yes, you'll get a Cisco NxOS config that will be valid when you do this. So, quota destroyer, let's see what we got here. Sounds like we have a Cisco guy. So again, an example of the configuration that's been created with all of the exports that were used and the command line, and then here's your Cisco switch config of everything you just told it to do. That's wild. I love it, it's, I had a lot of fun doing this. I know some people are working on tools to integrate the site surveys. They've had some interest in using this, and one of the things that they wanted me to make sure I had was an ability to import and export JSON, and that will allow them to take a look at how this works and then fold that into their tooling as well. Oh, and again, Andrew Stack said, so what happens in accounting if I put in a bandwidth target per cell? When you come to your output, you can see that I have enough bandwidth per switch to meet the bandwidth goal I put in. I have enough northbound aggregate, I have enough aggregation bandwidth out of both. then I can fail one to do it. I have enough ISO bandwidth for one switch or high availability where I can fail any one switch and still have bandwidth available to do that, and I've also tried to make sure that any inputs or any output has a help bubble that helps people understand what what the tool is doing. So, like, to echo what Muller was trying to say, like, traditionally, if you've been on the HPC side, you would, back in the day, typically be oversubscribed because your applications couldn't keep up with the networking, typically. so oversubscription was a thing and what's happening with these gpu with these gpu deployments is they're truly wanting this non-blocking kind of understanding that non-blocking if you know nothing else about it you could lose a switch and track and not take a performance hit non-blocking So that's what I tried to do here. Now always use Ross's sizing tool to really understand what you're doing from a network perspective and Ross has been taking a look at that. We want to find a way to bring the two together in the workflow so that what you end up with and end up with in the sizing you can that you can put into here and start your development of your of your switch conveyed because all I'm doing is kind of node ports and drawing a picture and so if the sizer can say hey this this is what you got for nodes this is what you got for switching this is the kind of switch you've chosen the tool can be told to use that and then work with it. any other questions you mentioned that you're not a coder what did you use to build this I use cursor and cursor is basically chat GTP and a whole bunch of a bunch of AI's to say hey do something Now what I what I will say is that when you're using AI for coding you have to treat it like an incredibly intelligent autistic four-year-old. They can do anything but keep your requests simple keep them to the point and always ask it if do you really understand what they want to do here. or yes, I see the change you want to make, make that surgical change only because if you just let it go and go, oh do this, I'll do that, you'll find out a week later something doesn't work that you never touched. It will take you two days to back that backtrack that and figure out. Jeff, do you see where your little cursor is over agent? Yes. Click on plan. right. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't used that yet. I don't know if I trust the four year old yet. I just like working with one planning will tell you exactly what it's going to do and then you can approve it step by step. Right. Right. So before you use a news agent, it like kind of goes and does the building. If you do the same and plan, it'll build a plan. and then you can improve it or tweak it. - I just, I just been burned so much. I just stare at it and focus and I go, what do you think I want to do? (laughing) - That, that, that install update button you got down there on the left. That's a, they got like a huge new update coming, so. - Yeah, that's, that's new today. That wasn't there half hour ago. That, they have like an agent, an agent editor now. Nice. Nice. You can toggle between different views and give it back to the ID to the agent editor. That's pretty cool. Yeah. So, again, I've got, I've got my page here. I hope people like it. Go ahead and download it, unzip it, play with it. Python being Python, somebody can have everything set up just like my laptop and you might hit a code bug. Cut it and paste it to me, we'll get it fixed. People watch on this page. I don't have this in GitHub yet. A) I don't know how to use it. B) I don't have an account, but we'll find a way to maybe track versioning here soon. Um, yeah, I, I really hope people like it, hit me with questions. Um, I had Russen on a phone call where he went, Hey, I want to see how well this works. We got on a call and he, and he, what, he, he just fed me inputs for like a 40 rack, uh, um, designed at one of our big CSPs. images, JSON, and SwitchConfig output in like three minutes, four minutes tops, and he just sat back in his chair and he went, "Jesus." I went, "Yeah, it's pretty cool." And he really enjoys that I enforce downloading via SwitchConfig every time. But before I go, I've got one thing I want everyone to see. We have two names for networking. We have converged networking. We have split networking. Split networking is when your C, your E-boxes, your southbound talks to southbound switches only. Your Ethernet talks to another set of switches that connect to the cluster environment only. Converged is when everything talks to the same leaf pairs, and it can be one NIC with everything together and bonded, et cetera, the different ways that we support all that, up into our southbound switches, and then through MLAs or balanced BGP up in the customer distribution switches, and then to end devices, consumers in the network. NICS. Southbound NIC, talking to VLN 69 in its own bridge domain, and a separate, complicated or not so complicated, set of networking commands to configure the switch to pass through the northbound Ethernet up to the customer environment. That's my public service message for today. There is no unified group energy. It's going to be a long time There's still a lot of slideware out there that lives in the middle of all these definitions. So the only thing that really matters is, the only thing that really matters is redefining what's happening here. We're split between two networks from northbound and southbound, or we're converged into one leaf pair. and what we do from there is just single neck or dual neck. Arguably, I think it makes the conversation easier because we don't have a third option that looks a lot like converge, but is or isn't depending on how you define it. But all we're doing is we're defining if we're using two switches to get out of the C node or one set of switches. Okay, one quick sec. So first thing that SCs need to understand is all of these switches you're looking at There's no clients plugged into these Never never allow the end consumer to plug into the cell phone switch. In other words, there's some chatter around Oh, can we use our SN5600s and stuff your stuff in there and you know, so It is provoked, Dima will get on a plane and come out and explain it to your forehead very vinyl-y. But that's been thrown around, so they just need to make sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, it's a fair question, because if you don't know, you don't know, and the issue is basically buffer management. When we configure our southbound switches to do the things we want. them to do for our southbound, there is no additional buffering for consumers on that switch. Consumers must live outside our southbound switches and connect somewhere else. The problem, Andy, is our communication about this. I know you've lobbied for Unified. I've lobbied for Unified. Those converged, is a messy term and that's the problem is that they're they're instantly thinking about using their switches if you start using that language so I would push back hard on that. I know it's in the NCP language, I think it's wrong and we need to correct that. It's very people like Cisco are making that assumption and that's That's what I was running to, Jeff, that's why I asked you about that specifically. They had no idea and they architected something, assuming it could plug clients into a southbound switch. Yeah. That needs to be fixed. Oh yeah. The education out, especially out to Cisco, especially their networking. guys right they they don't know necessarily what we're doing with all of our stuff. I think it also would be good to identify or at least to list the pros and cons of one versus the other. Why the why one versus the other more so than the pros and cons. - Well, I think there are some pros and cons of one versus the other, but okay. - Well, again, that becomes a little bit of a religious argument. So we can work, I think, internally to make the case for each of the three styles. 'Cause there are benefits and drawbacks to each one, obviously. But many of them are... perceived more than realistic. - So Rick here, apologies if I didn't say his name right. He's got a really good short document which takes you through some of the decision processes here. I tried to put together a quick and dirty table decision matrix, but that blew up and it wasn't that simple. are reasons when you will want to do one thing over another and to some people they're really clear to other people they're not. So if you ever have a question ask. More than pros and cons I think this would be served without when this is a good idea and when this is a bad idea. Yeah. Yeah. It's going to be a scale question, though, right? And that's why my little decision table, red, yellow, green, got kind of messy yesterday because Dave Petitka had some really good input and he's like, "Well, why do you say you wouldn't want to do that? At what point can you do multi-rack with MLag, but where should you stop?" I was like, "Uh, yeah, okay." I can say our, like he said, we could say stop at four. Well, things get kind of. - Right, but it's more like two is fine. Between three and seven, you could, you couldn't, you could argue it either way. Beyond seven, you'd be stupid. - Yeah, but that's why. but I don't know if I can get here so >> and there's also the principle I have tended to teach everybody as you joined here and I've had an opportunity to teach you be careful when you're making decisions because you can back your customer into a very, very difficult corner You know, things like using VXLAN rather than LeafSpine, you know, even though it's not needed for a smaller one, it's needed for larger ones, right? So, you know, there's all those kind of questions that we need to really work on. So I think it's Eric or Arik has joined us and he's on Ronan Cohen's team. Ronan Cohen is the solutions team. awesome integration documents for us that go in the knowledge base. So Eric's documents, when he finishes them up, are going to go into our knowledge base for our consumption and customer and partner consumption as well. So just know that that's coming down the pipe. I don't have a date on that though. - No, somewhere, and I apologize. I don't know where off the top of my head. There's a way to open a... add your request to the networking team and they will help you with uh dt no not dt it's uh field request is uh is um rosalynn and dima there it is there it is field request type networking networking request open up the thing here and say hey maybe this isn't so big a problem, but I'm confused what to do here. They'll help you out. - Good information. Thank you. - And yeah, use my tool. Tell me what it should be doing. a couple of people are arguing hard for you. You should draw a rack diagram. No, Ross draws rack diagrams. (laughing) You should do this. No, that tool does that pretty cleanly. Will this tool disappear and fold into other larger projects that will help the field grow? Yes, I hope it does. that's what it's here for. I'm not emotionally attached to it and I'm going to run away with it. I hope this turns into something larger for everybody as uh as as uh Brad Foss's and his team grows their tooling but uh enjoy it use it um if someone has a question say oh let me build that and then send them a JSON file on here load this that will do what you want so it's going to be a way for people to collaborate you know with with these configurations in a ways that they haven't before yeah Jeff just let me warn you that that which is dead will never die mmm yes that's very true I wrote a Google Sheet many moons ago, and lo and behold, it's on version 2.3.7.9. - Yeah, we'll need you to update that next March. So don't go anywhere. - We delude Howard into an AI and just have it called Howard instead of cursor. - There you go. - Our digital twin. (laughing) - I get 8% royalties. - Anything else here? - On the gross. - I haven't kept up with the questions here. Yeah. - I think pretty much everything's been answered. You covered it. Anybody else have any questions in the chat? Tim, no guard, I'm with you on that, uh, helping, uh, debug by typing it down. Oh, oh, oh, Tim, oh, there's some, there's something I didn't show you, um, but wait, there's more. There it is. There it is. More configurations. So you got all this data in here. You enable legacy configurations, oh this is in my way, let me move it, you go into your legacy, that's what I was waiting on, Jeff, you go into your legacy installs, put in the stuff that you need for legacy installs, and say I've got, I don't know, I got, I got, I got 20 of those, series, type v2, I got 15 vboxes. allow you to enter in custom host host names in here so if you hover over this you're going to get a help screen there you go instruct custom host names in your in your manual installs okay let's go and configure the rest here and say okay we're gonna do that to that to that to to that i don't know 30 dns servers do you create configure network commands are the man and it's gonna tell you if you enter and enter in something bad here so I'm not gonna make anything bad like for example you can't create a network IP address larger than it should be but let's go ahead and do this the right way we do all this, we do all this, it knows what I'm doing for switches, I'm on a Cisco switch, I'm using second NIC, sets your network, FoxStack, Ethernet, ETH, all those done, I didn't change my VLAN, this will carry over from the front if you change your customer VLAN to another number. and they want to use VLAN 69 here. Not a problem, it will carry over. If you want to change the template, you put it right here on 23.14.12. You want to change your BIP, you want to change your ISO values because you're going to build a small cluster today, but it's going to be bigger in three months, so you want to make sure to get that. change in today and then say generic commands uh because i don't have any tool that provides a sanity check just make sure you review these for completeness okay and it's going to warn you if you've done something that it's not that you're not allowed hey so my vms uh yeah i'm going to change those because i defined ones up here in the front but i have my install space and legacy input somewhere else yeah 30 like i said i'm just making stuff up here Now it should be good. Do that, do that, boom. I've got legacy commands. - Oh, that is awesome. - Put away the tissues and enjoy the glow coming off your screen. - Oh, that's fantastic. - So even if you never do this, your install plan will become, you have it. - Yeah. - And you'll never need it. I hope. Long live easy install. Nice, and then you can save it out to a file, and I can't say, I can't say enough thank you to Jeremy Ortega and the Fed team. They have a Python script that they run around and they build these installs with manually because they mostly do manuals in the dark sites. they can be in control of the process and it makes sense so without him i wouldn't have this done so yes you can go in here you can edit in uh what's the word i'm looking for if you want to submit differently per rack subsystems subsystem yeah you can add subsystems into this it's just it's just a big search and replay place if you want to edit this by hand it's actually pretty nice but but you get you get you get the you get the structure you need to walk into an install and if support opens up your install plan they won't need anything hey Paul's asking IPv6 support it's not here Not that it couldn't be in here, I just thought that. - That is a no, Paul. - That is a no. Honestly, I don't know enough about IPv6 on to know what to ask for and what to do for validations. I really don't. I mean, that's probably most of us. except stack I think I'm out of but wait there's more but oh I was waiting for the I was waiting for that one I was waiting for the one and you did it and also we've talked about I'll take this out of here. I'll take this out of here. Melanox, we know how they order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 vertically. Ciscos are interesting. Erysis are different in that they order in two rows of 32. So they will not be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, et cetera, et cetera. They were 1 through 32. 32s on the top, 33 through 64s on the bottom. So if you configure for an Arista switch, I do enforce physical port numbering order. That way it's a lot easier to build a cable plan in port one, port two, port three, port four, and not port one, port two, port 33, port 34, and, you know, we're going to have contract installers, you know, that spend their nights in a hotel eating crayons, you know, former Marines, and they're going to go on site and have to go through a plan to install this. So keeping things in physical port order is probably going to be simpler for them. Yes, Mr. Mueller, amazing work. Thank you very much. Yes, absolutely, yes, and I wouldn't mind, I wouldn't mind a session at SCO to go over this, if people are interested, because I know people have questions. I think I'll be in Orlando, but I might be doing a revenue install for Cisco or Stack. I don't know who at that time, so there's lots. I'm in the fire for me right now. Thanks for your time. I'm done talking. - Thank you. Hey, Jeff, guys, I saw this tool like two months ago and saw the development over time. Like you've done an amazing job and thank you for sharing Jeff. SEs, you know, go try the tool out, provide feedback. If you have any tools and things that can help the community, feel free to reach out. I'll get you some time on here to showcase what you have also. Another thing, if you talk to anybody that is not on the invite, please have them reach out to me so I can get them back in the invite, getting that request a lot during the call, and with that, I don't have anything else. You guys have a great rest of the week. - Thanks, Jamie, you too. - Thanks. (keyboard clicking)
