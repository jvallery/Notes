## Recent Context

- 2025-10-06: [[2025-10-06 - Jason briefed Jai on offers from VAST and Crusoe, noting VAST’s complex, risky c]] - Weekly 1:1 between Jason Vallery and Jai Menon discussing Jason’s competing offers from VAST and Cru... (via Jai Menon)

## Key Facts

- Jason has a VAST offer with complex, highly variable compensation tied to OpenAI/Azure sales plus equity.
- Crusoe offer deadline is Wednesday; VAST has not set a decision deadline.
- Microsoft cannot approach Crusoe-level compensation; any change would be modest and potentially insulting.
- Apollo scope and responsibilities are unclear, making it hard to define a successful role or path to partner.
- Jason values clear scope, hands-on technical work, and influencing customer deals.
- Jason estimates ~$800k in vested compensation would be forfeited if leaving Microsoft.
- Jason planned to meet Renan (described as VAST CEO) to quantify risk and negotiate equity/commission.
- Jason stated staying at Microsoft is effectively a closed option.
