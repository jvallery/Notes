## Key Decisions

- ✅ Do not pursue a Microsoft counteroffer given compensation constraints and unclear scope.
- ✅ Proceed toward a decision between VAST and Crusoe with intent to resign by Wednesday.

## Key Facts

- Jason has a VAST offer with complex, highly variable compensation tied to OpenAI/Azure sales plus equity.
- Crusoe offer deadline is Wednesday; VAST has not set a decision deadline.
- Microsoft cannot approach Crusoe-level compensation; any change would be modest and potentially insulting.
- Apollo scope and responsibilities are unclear, making it hard to define a successful role or path to partner.
- Jason values clear scope, hands-on technical work, and influencing customer deals.
- Jason estimates ~$800k in vested compensation would be forfeited if leaving Microsoft.
- Jason planned to meet Renan (described as VAST CEO) to quantify risk and negotiate equity/commission.
- Jason stated staying at Microsoft is effectively a closed option.

Job offers comparison (VAST vs Crusoe vs Microsoft), Compensation structure risk (commission/equity variability), Apollo program scope ambiguity and execution risk, Career trajectory and path to partner at Microsoft, Resignation timeline
