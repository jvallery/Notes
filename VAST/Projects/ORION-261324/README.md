## Recent Context

- 2025-12-01: Mentioned in: RFE 0482 (NVIDIA DGX Cloud): unified visibility across NCPs, dual-uplink and tenant-scoped Uplink access
## Key Facts

- Mordechai Blaunstein said VAST is already working on similar requests from multiple CSPs and is defining a new VIP pool type called "Service Aware VIP Pool" to allow multi-VIP access to the VMS for GUI/CLI/REST/SSH/CSI; he referenced an internal wiki page and Jira ORION-261324.

- Mordechai Blaunstein indicated a tentative target to support the "Service Aware VIP Pool" work in VAST release 5.6, but explicitly noted it is not confirmed and asked whether it meets the timeline or if a shortcut/workaround is needed.
