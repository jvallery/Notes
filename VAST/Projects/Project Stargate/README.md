# Project Stargate

## Overview

OpenAI-related initiative referenced as 'Project Stargate'; VAST has a newly started sell-to relationship and Jason would have dotted-line involvement in the prospective VAST role.

## Status

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | active |
| **Owner** | _Unknown_ |

## Current Blockers

- ❌ Unclear earnings range and cash-flow timing under VAST’s sales-linked compensation plan
- ❌ Early-stage motion; compensation tied to sales outcomes increases personal financial risk
- ❌ Early-stage/just getting started; unclear outcomes tied to commission-like compensation

## Next Steps

- [ ] Clarify scope of Jason’s dotted-line responsibilities and success metrics (pending offer negotiation)
- [ ] Confirm final terms/structure of Jason’s involvement and compensation linkage
- [ ] Clarify responsibilities and success metrics for Jason’s involvement if joining VAST

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Do not pursue an internal compensation/scope package at this time.
- ✅ Jason will not stay at Microsoft.
- ✅ Jason will choose between VAST and Crusoe by 2025-10-08 (leaning VAST pending de-risking).
- ✅ Do not pursue a Microsoft counteroffer given compensation constraints and unclear scope.
- ✅ Proceed toward a decision between VAST and Crusoe with intent to resign by Wednesday.
- ✅ Do not pursue a Microsoft counteroffer/retention package.
- ✅ Jason will choose between VAST and Crusoe by Wednesday and proceed with resignation if accepting an external offer.

## Key Facts

- Crusoe deadline is 2025-10-08.
- Prospective VAST role: PM title reporting to Jeff Denworth and VAST CEO (referred to as Renan); owns PM for a cloud control plane via Red Stapler (founded by Jan C. Stefansson); dotted-line support to Microsoft sell-to/sell-with and OpenAI Project Stargate.
- VAST compensation includes commission as a percentage of sales to OpenAI/Azure; equity component described as modest; outcome could range from zero to many millions.
- Leaving Microsoft would forfeit roughly $800K already vested, reducing the net gap versus a $2M offer to about $1.1–$1.2M.
- Apollo scope/boundaries at Microsoft are unclear with many stakeholders and tight timelines as data centers go live.
- Path to partner at Microsoft remains undefined.
- Jason has a VAST offer with complex, highly variable compensation tied to OpenAI/Azure sales plus equity.
- Crusoe offer deadline is Wednesday; VAST has not set a decision deadline.
- Microsoft cannot approach Crusoe-level compensation; any change would be modest and potentially insulting.
- Apollo scope and responsibilities are unclear, making it hard to define a successful role or path to partner.
