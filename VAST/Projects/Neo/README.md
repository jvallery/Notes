# Neo

## Overview

Neo cloud feature requirements workstream; core to current business; Morty owns requirements and must remain focused even as he moves to Jason’s team.

## Status

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | active |
| **Owner** | Morty |

## Current Blockers

- ❌ Risk of Morty being pulled into non-Neo support work (e.g., OpenAI/Microsoft) due to incentives

## Next Steps

- [ ] Align with Morty on priorities and time-boxed contributions to broader cloud strategy
- [ ] Maintain Neo focus while leveraging Morty for program/process knowledge

## Collaborators

| Person | Role | Company |
|--------|------|---------|
| [[Morty]] |  | VAST Data |
| [[Alon Horev]] |  | VAST Data |
| [[Jason Vallery]] | Product management (cloud); partnerships with hyperscale cloud providers | VAST Data |

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Carl to move to ProServe under Rob.
- ✅ FRDs and detailed customer requirements will be authored/maintained in Confluence.
- ✅ Jason will own multi-cloud strategy end-to-end and catalog in-flight opportunities from a product requirements lens.
- ✅ Establish a monthly touchpoint between Jason and Brandon.

## Key Facts

- John owns alliances/partnerships for conventional channels (incl. AMD/NVIDIA) and control-plane partner ecosystem for Tier-2 cloud-in-a-box.
- Morty owns Neo cloud feature requirements; moving to Jason’s team but must keep Neo focus.
- Customer Success under Rob is effectively reactive support, not proactive CS.
- SE org is critical to Jason’s success; Hari called out as a top SE.
- China posture agreed: software-only sales outpost; avoid CAPEX/headcount build-out.
- Need a crisp, quantified Azure Storage gaps narrative ('dagger' slide) and a repeatable measurement rubric across clouds.
- Win/loss analysis should be routine and tied to Sales Ops; cloud is a platform, product gaps apply across deployment environments.
- Confluence is the engineering-respected source of truth for FRDs/requirements; coordinate taxonomy with Alon (A.L.) and Tomer.

## Topics / Themes

Org chart and key leaders across marketing, alliances, SE, sales, finance, Multi-cloud strategy mandate (Azure/AWS/GCP/Oracle) and complement vs compete framing, Cloud packaging and serverless/pipelines gaps, Neo cloud requirements ownership and team transition, Customer Success vs support operating model, SE engagement strategy and Tech Summit embedding, China go-to-market posture (software-only), Azure Storage limitations and messaging for Microsoft, Google RFP triage and no-bid criteria for block/latency-heavy asks, Confluence as FRD system of record and documentation taxonomy, Win/loss cadence and product MBR rhythm
