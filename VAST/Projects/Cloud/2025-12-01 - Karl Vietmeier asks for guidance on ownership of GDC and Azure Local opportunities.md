# Karl Vietmeier asks for guidance on ownership of GDC and Azure Local opportunities

**Date**: 2025-12-01

**Project**: [[Cloud]]

**Attendees**: Karl Vietmeier, Myself

## Summary

Karl Vietmeier reports growing interest in whether VAST supports Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Microsoft Azure Local, and notes that ownership often shifts to on-prem teams once hardware is involved. He recommends cloud product management own these opportunities to avoid accountability confusion and to align execution with hyperscaler relationships and cloud consumption motions. He asks Jason Vallery for guidance on how aggressively to assert cloud PM ownership and how much control Jason wants to maintain.


## Action Items


- [?] Provide guidance to Karl Vietmeier on whether cloud product management should assert ownership for Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Microsoft Azure Local opportunities, including how aggressively to assert ownership and what level of control Jason Vallery wants to maintain. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Karl Vietmeier is seeing growing market interest in whether VAST Data supports Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Microsoft Azure Local.

- Karl Vietmeier observes that opportunities that start as cloud opportunities often shift to on-prem teams once hardware is involved, which creates confusion over accountability and reduces visibility into progress and outcomes.

- Karl Vietmeier believes Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Microsoft Azure Local opportunities should be managed through cloud product management because cloud PM has the strongest hyperscaler relationships and these solutions are expected to be acquired through hyperscalers and tied to cloud consumption.
