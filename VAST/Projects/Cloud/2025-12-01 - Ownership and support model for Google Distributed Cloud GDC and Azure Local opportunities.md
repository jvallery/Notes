# Ownership and support model for Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local opportunities

**Date**: 2025-12-01

**Project**: [[Cloud]]

**Attendees**: Karl Vietmeier, Myself

## Summary

Karl Vietmeier flagged growing market interest in VAST support for Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Microsoft Azure Local. He noted that when hardware is involved, on-prem teams tend to take ownership, which creates accountability confusion and reduces cloud team visibility. Karl asked Jason Vallery for guidance on how strongly Cloud Product Management should assert ownership and control for these opportunities.


## Action Items


- [?] Provide guidance to Karl Vietmeier on how aggressively Cloud Product Management should assert ownership and how much control Jason Vallery wants to maintain over Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Microsoft Azure Local opportunities. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Karl Vietmeier is a Cloud Solutions Architect for VAST on Cloud at VAST Data.

- VAST Data is seeing growing interest from the market in whether VAST supports Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Microsoft Azure Local.

- When GDC or Azure Local opportunities involve hardware, VAST on-prem teams tend to take ownership, which can create confusion over accountability and reduce Cloud Product Management visibility into progress and outcomes.

- Karl Vietmeier believes GDC and Azure Local opportunities should be managed through Cloud Product Management because the cloud team has the strongest hyperscaler relationships and these solutions are expected to be acquired through hyperscalers and tied to cloud consumption.
