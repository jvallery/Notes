# Microsoft workback plan, CoreWeave MFN comparison and TCO model refinement

**Date**: 2026-01-05

**Project**: [[Cloud]]

**Attendees**: Jonsi Stefansson, Erik Wolf, Lior Genzel, Jeff Denworth, Helen Protopapas, Rick Scurfield, Myself

## Summary

Internal VAST thread to build a Microsoft-facing financial workback plan, including CoreWeave MFN comparison, pricing inputs ($3.60/TB/month) and discount context (94.9% before a price hike). Erik Wolf and Jason Vallery started a financial analysis and updated a spreadsheet model, while Jeff Denworth requested parallel refinement of a full TCO model including power and opportunity cost, with urgency to be ready for Davos.


## Action Items


- [?] Provide Microsoft-facing CoreWeave comparison inputs, including any MFN-relevant pricing context and how CoreWeave should be treated as a competitor reference in Microsoft negotiations. @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Build or update a financial model that can evaluate two scenarios (referred to as #1 and #2 in the email) for the Microsoft workback plan, with adjustable parameters and a gut-checked spreadsheet output. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Draft a full split of hardware and software economics for CoreWeave-related baselines, including (1) VAST software on Azure Storage bare metal SKUs using Microsoft hardware and price per TB per month software-only, and (2) VAST ODM hardware with VAST software including the HW/SW split, noting that CoreWeave contract only locked software pricing. @Erik Wolf ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Refine the Microsoft TCO model in parallel with the workback plan, adding power consumption and the opportunity cost/value to Microsoft of lower power usage, not just COGS. @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule a discussion with Erik Wolf to review the updated spreadsheet model and align on next steps for the Microsoft workback plan (Erik suggested 'tonight or tomorrow morning'). @Myself #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Jonsi Stefansson stated that CoreWeave has a most-favored-nation (MFN) clause in its contract with VAST Data and some level of exclusivity, and requested a CoreWeave comparison for Microsoft negotiations.

- Erik Wolf provided a pricing input of $3.60 per TB per month in the context of the Microsoft workback plan discussion.

- Erik Wolf stated that before a recent price hike, the list price discount referenced in the thread was about 94.9%.

- Erik Wolf stated that VAST Data only locked in a software pricing model with CoreWeave (no full hardware plus software split locked in).

- Erik Wolf stated he started a financial analysis with Jason Vallery and that they would have adjustable parameters to evaluate two scenarios (referred to as #1 and #2 in the email) and design the model accordingly.

- Erik Wolf stated that Jason Vallery already had a chunk of the analysis done and that they put it into the latest spreadsheet model to gut-check the numbers.

- Jeff Denworth requested that VAST refine a total cost of ownership (TCO) model in parallel with the Microsoft workback plan, including power and the opportunity cost to Microsoft of lower power consumption.

- Jeff Denworth stated there is urgency to have the Microsoft-facing materials 'buttoned up for Davos' if VAST is competing with Microsoft's storage team (as relayed by Lior Genzel).
