## Key Facts

- No generally available, transactable “VAST on Cloud” offering exists today; current work is roadmap plus early marketplace/private-offer motions.
- FY26 prioritization is core layers first (cloud primitives, control plane stance, tenancy, operability/SLOs) before building higher-layer services.
- Marketplace offers are necessary for transactability, but VM economics can be non-competitive at scale; longer-term paths include cloud primitives and potentially CSP data-center hardware.
- Multi-tenancy gaps exist; a key blocker is limited identity provider scale and tenant-scoping constraints.
- Preferred architecture is hyperscaler object storage as the durable system of record, with VAST providing compute-adjacent caching and global namespace access.
- Control plane requirements include entitlements/fulfillment notifications and metering integration (e.g., marketplace/private offers).
- Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) is a strategic opportunity: Google issued a US-based RFP to replace NetApp for Distributed Cloud deployments.
- Hybrid-scale customer requirements (e.g., Walmart) drive deeper native cloud object integration expectations (especially GCS API compatibility).

- The requested document title indicates content related to VAST integration with Microsoft Azure, which is relevant to VAST's Cloud workstream.

- The Cloud program includes work related to a PRD for VAST on Azure.

- The 'VAST and Azure Integration' document includes a positioning statement that cold data can be transparently tiered to Azure Blob using either VAST native opaque formats (for maximum data reduction) or transparent open standard formats (for ecosystem accessibility), to enable infinite scale without flash price premium.

- The 'VAST and Azure Integration' document argues that constrained flash supply and rising prices make an all-flash exabyte-scale strategy economically risky, and that deep integration with Azure Blob allows customers to place the long-tail dataset on HDD-based object storage while keeping VAST flash for the GPU-adjacent working set.

- Mordechai Blaunstein referenced internal tracking for the approach: ORION-261324 and an internal wiki page (vastdata.atlassian.net/wiki/x/lQDInQE).

## Key Decisions

- Prioritize core cloud layers before higher-layer services.
- Use an explicit operating cadence and decision log to reduce churn and speed decisions.

- Jeff Denworth assigned Mordechai Blaunstein to lead the investigation of RFE 0482 and to bring in additional parties as needed.

- TLS support for VAST Block protocol will not be included in VAST release 5.6 because it was deferred in favor of other protocol features requested by more customers.

- Salesforce RFE 0538 (Documentation) for NTT DATA Japan Corporation was submitted to the PM team and approved by Rob Benoit.

- Jeff Denworth assigned Mordechai Blaunstein to take ownership of investigating RFE 0482 and to bring in additional parties as needed.

- RFE 0538 (Documentation) was approved by Rob Benoit for submission to the Product Management team.

- Decline Microsoft's request for an Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing because VAST Azure is not ready for that use case.
