## Key Facts

- Pete Eming reports to Vamshi and currently owns the Azure Storage relationship with OpenAI and Microsoft AI (previously owned by Jason).
- OpenAI is reportedly replatforming away from Azure Blob API for some scenarios and building their own solution using rclone and other tools.
- Discussion claim: Microsoft’s deal with OpenAI gives Microsoft exclusive ownership/rights to every line of code written at OpenAI until AGI is declared by OpenAI’s board; Microsoft can reuse that IP for Azure services.
- Per discussion, OpenAI’s likely competition is internal (in-house storage/capacity management) rather than external vendors like Weka.
- OpenAI infrastructure mentioned: L-series VMs, potential bare metal L-series, bare metal UltraDisk, and Blob Storage HDD clusters.
- John runs alliances/partnerships and is the go-to for AMD/NVIDIA and channel (non-cloud).
- Sagi leads pipelines/serverless and needs alignment on cloud GTM and packaging.
- Morty owns Neo cloud feature requirements and must maintain that coverage while supporting the author’s area.
- Rob’s customer success org is primarily support and systems engineering today.
- Confluence is the source of record for FRDs/customer requirements for engineering consumption.

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Initial framing decision: avoid focusing only on OpenAI and Microsoft AI as the only customers; aim for a broader 'in for a pound' approach (directional preference stated by Jeff).
- ✅ Carl will move to ProServe under Rob rather than supporting customer-facing PM work.
- ✅ Set a monthly touchpoint with Brandon to align on cloud platform priorities.
- ✅ Customer requirement docs and FRDs will be authored and maintained in Confluence.
- ✅ Focus on building a first-class cross-cloud platform and GTM versus ad hoc deal chasing.
- ✅ China should be approached as a sales outpost rather than a location for significant capital investment or operational infrastructure.
- ✅ Carl will move to ProServe under Rob due to limitations in customer-facing roles.
