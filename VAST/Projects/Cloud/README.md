## Topics

## Blockers

- ❌ Bottleneck fix required before confirming GA timing
- ❌ Risk of lift-and-shift approach without cloud primitives/control-plane stance
- ❌ MAI control-plane fragility and GPU issues may slow proof points
- ❌ Azure internal politics (Compute vs Storage) and long hardware qualification timelines
- ❌ Fragmentation risk if higher-layer opinionated services are built too early
