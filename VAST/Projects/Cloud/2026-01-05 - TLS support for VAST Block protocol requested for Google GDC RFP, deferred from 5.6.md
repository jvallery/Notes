# TLS support for VAST Block protocol requested for Google GDC RFP, deferred from 5.6

**Date**: 2026-01-05

**Project**: [[Cloud]]

**Attendees**: Itzik Reich, Noa Cohen, Myself, Maroun (last name unknown)

## Summary

Itzik Reich asked Noa Cohen whether TLS support for VAST Block protocol would ship in VAST release 5.6 because it is a must-have requirement for a Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP. Noa confirmed it was planned for 5.6 but was deferred due to higher-demand protocol features, and asked when Google requires it to consider a minor release after 5.6. Itzik requested that Jason Vallery coordinate with Google once Maroun provides proposed test timing.


## Action Items


- [?] Coordinate with Google on TLS support for the VAST Block protocol once Maroun (last name unknown) provides the proposed test timing, to align Google GDC RFP validation expectations. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide proposed test timing for validating TLS support for the VAST Block protocol (context: Google GDC RFP). @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm with Google GDC RFP stakeholders the required date for TLS support for the VAST Block protocol so VAST can evaluate inclusion in a minor release after 5.6. @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- TLS support for VAST Block protocol will not be included in VAST release 5.6 because it was deferred in favor of other protocol features requested by more customers.




## Key Information


- Transport Layer Security (TLS) support for the VAST Block protocol was planned for VAST release 5.6 but was deferred due to other protocol features requested by more customers.

- Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP requires TLS support for the VAST Block protocol as a must-have requirement for VAST to be considered.

- Noa Cohen is an engineering stakeholder for clarifying VAST’s end-to-end development lifecycle (gates, signoffs, source control, CI/CD).
