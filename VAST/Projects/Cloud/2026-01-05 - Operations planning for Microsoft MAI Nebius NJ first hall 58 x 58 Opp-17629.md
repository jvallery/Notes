# Operations planning for Microsoft MAI Nebius NJ first hall 58 x 58 (Opp-17629)

**Date**: 2026-01-05

**Project**: [[Cloud]]

**Attendees**: Lior Genzel, Moshe Pinto, Rick Scurfield, Regina (last name unknown), Ray (last name unknown)

## Summary

Lior Genzel shared operational details for the Microsoft MAI training deployment at the Nebius New Jersey data center, which scales to 812 x 812 at full build-out and starts with a first-hall 58 x 58 phase. The team is pushing for a procurement decision between VAST and Azure Blob before the end of January 2026, while navigating supply chain constraints for NAND and 800Gb switches.


## Action Items


- [?] Check whether Microsoft can source their own 800Gb switches for the Microsoft MAI Nebius New Jersey deployment because VAST's price book does not currently include 800Gb switches. @Lior Genzel ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide Regina (last name unknown) the specific expected configuration for the Microsoft opportunity (Rick Scurfield requested this after hearing a possible March 2026 shipment need for a 57 x 57 configuration). @Lior Genzel ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm with Ray (last name unknown, UK) how flexible VAST's configuration can be for the Microsoft MAI Nebius New Jersey first-hall deployment before finalizing the organized information package. @Lior Genzel #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Ask Microsoft for a software purchase order that covers the full scope of the MAI Nebius New Jersey project (beyond the first hall hardware currently reflected in SFDC Opp-17629). @TBD 📅 2026-01-31 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Target decision is between deploying VAST Data versus using Azure Blob (Microsoft's original plan) for the Microsoft MAI training deployment at the Nebius New Jersey data center.

- Team aims to reach a decision in the coming business days to enable a procurement decision before 2026-01-31.




## Key Information


- Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) training deployment at the Nebius New Jersey data center is planned to scale to an 812 x 812 configuration at full build-out.

- The MAI Nebius New Jersey deployment is designed to be installed in phases, with the first phase requiring hardware for one hall and a 58 x 58 configuration.

- Latest update as of 2026-01-05 is that Microsoft expects to install the first hall for the MAI Nebius New Jersey deployment in the May/June 2026 timeframe, then move aggressively to the other 13 halls before the end of 2026.

- VAST triggered urgency with Microsoft MAI due to severe supply chain constraints and is running a parallel evaluation of whether the deployment can be done on Microsoft hardware (Azure Blob or Azure Compute) or using Microsoft NAND supply chain.

- Salesforce opportunity for this Microsoft MAI Nebius New Jersey deployment is SFDC Opp-17629, and the current SFDC opportunity scope calls out only the hardware for the first hall.

- Plan is to ask Microsoft for a software purchase order that covers the full scope of the MAI Nebius New Jersey project, not just the first hall hardware.

- The SFDC quote for the Microsoft MAI Nebius New Jersey deployment does not include switches because 800Gb switches are not available in VAST's price book.

- Lior Genzel stated he will check whether Microsoft can source their own 800Gb switches for the MAI Nebius New Jersey deployment.

- Rick Scurfield told Regina (last name unknown) that Lior Genzel mentioned a possible need to ship a 57 x 57 configuration in the March 2026 timeframe for the Microsoft opportunity, and that it should be tracked on the Soft Backlog until it firms up.

- Rick Scurfield noted that Lior Genzel mentioned trying to source hardware from Dell for the Microsoft opportunity, but Rick was unsure that would be possible based on recent information.
