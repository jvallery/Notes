# Microsoft requests Azure VoC for GPU performance testing, VAST plans to decline

**Date**: 2025-12-11

**Project**: [[Cloud]]

**Attendees**: Ray Coetzee, Lior Genzel, Karl Vietmeier, Myself

## Summary

Microsoft requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU instances because their Redmond lab lacks GPU nodes. Lior Genzel directed Ray Coetzee to schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft/Azure requestors but stated the answer will be no because VAST Azure is not ready for this use case.


## Action Items


- [?] Schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft/Azure team who requested an Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing so Lior Genzel can communicate the refusal. @Ray Coetzee ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide the expected performance profile for an Azure VoC instance (if it were to be considered) in response to Ray Coetzee's question. @Karl Vietmeier #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Decline Microsoft's request for an Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing because VAST Azure is not ready for that use case.




## Key Information


- A physical VAST proof-of-concept (PoC) system is installed in Microsoft's lab in Redmond and Microsoft is actively testing it.

- Microsoft's Redmond lab does not currently have GPU nodes available for testing.

- Microsoft requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU instances.

- Lior Genzel stated that VAST Azure is not close to being ready to be used for Microsoft's requested Azure VoC GPU performance testing scenario.

- Lior Genzel plans to block the Microsoft request for an Azure VoC instance and communicate the refusal directly.
