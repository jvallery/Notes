# Red flare escalation: Azure MAI deal risk, supply chain constraints, and January execution plan

**Date**: 2025-12-27

**Project**: [[Cloud]]

**Attendees**: Jeff Denworth, Jonsi Stefansson, Lior Genzel, Rick Scurfield, Renen Hallak, Myself

## Summary

Jeff Denworth escalated concern that VAST is losing the Azure MAI Q1 deal due to slow execution and lack of aggressive engagement, compounded by global supply chain constraints. The thread calls for immediate on-site presence in Redmond, rapid commercial discussions, and a January milestone plan culminating in paperwork in the last week of January. Jonsi Stefansson reported Microsoft expects an Azure Blob integration proposal from VAST and that Microsoft contacts are largely out of office until 2026-01-05.


## Action Items


- [?] Sync with Jonsi Stefansson to produce the integration proposal between VAST and Azure Blob that Microsoft (Aung and Maneesh) is expecting. @Myself 📅 2025-12-30 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Get current, specific intelligence on Microsoft MAI supply chain status and constraints to guide VAST's deal strategy, as requested by Jeff Denworth. @Jonsi Stefansson 📅 2026-01-05 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Get current, specific intelligence on Microsoft MAI supply chain status and constraints to guide VAST's deal strategy, as requested by Jeff Denworth. @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-05 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Set up an engineering workshop in Redmond with Microsoft stakeholders to advance the Azure Blob integration and MAI technical alignment. @Jonsi Stefansson 📅 2026-01-17 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Ensure someone between Lior Genzel and Jonsi Stefansson is physically in Redmond immediately at the start of 2026 to begin commercial conversations for the Microsoft MAI deal. @TBD 📅 2026-01-02 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Begin real supply chain and hardware build conversations with Microsoft MAI stakeholders by the second week of January 2026, per Jeff Denworth's milestone plan. @TBD 📅 2026-01-16 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule Renen Hallak to be in Redmond by the third week of January 2026 to meet with 'Scott G' at Microsoft to align philosophically on the first tranche and scaling plan with VAST. @TBD 📅 2026-01-23 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Drive contract paperwork completion with Microsoft MAI during the last week of January 2026, per Jeff Denworth's milestone plan. @TBD 📅 2026-01-31 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide Jeff Denworth with daily status updates on progress, blockers, and next actions for the Microsoft MAI deal, responding to his request for more active communication. @Myself 📅 2026-01-02 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Jeff Denworth directed the team to treat CoreWeave testing as largely cosmetic and to prioritize immediate commercial and supply chain execution with Microsoft MAI.

- Jeff Denworth proposed moving to daily updates to improve communication and execution velocity on the Microsoft MAI deal.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated he is rapidly losing confidence in VAST closing a Q1 deal with Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) and believes VAST's lack of aggressive execution is a key contributor.

- Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) needs 2 exabytes (2EB) of storage capacity deployed 'on the floor' in 2025, per Jeff Denworth's summary of the situation.

- Jeff Denworth reported global supply chain turmoil and that VAST likely cannot support the MAI scale natively via Arrow or Avnet supply chain channels.

- Jeff Denworth reported Microsoft is also in a difficult supply chain position but has a large allocation across Azure.

- Jeff Denworth reported Microsoft is considering HDDs for the first April delivery for MAI scale-up, and that HDD supply is also constrained.

- Jeff Denworth stated that testing at CoreWeave for this MAI-related effort has not started in earnest and that VAST has not started commercial discussions for the deal.

- Jeff Denworth asserted Microsoft must order hardware early to utilize GPUs quickly, and therefore must decide on storage software early because software choice materially impacts the hardware purchase.

- Jeff Denworth stated VAST is the most infrastructure-efficient option for Microsoft MAI at scale and pushed the team to act accordingly.

- Jonsi Stefansson reported he met with Microsoft contacts named Aung and Maneesh, and they expect VAST to provide an integration proposal with Azure Blob.

- Jonsi Stefansson reported he emailed multiple Microsoft contacts to understand Microsoft supply chain status and platform needs, but received out-of-office replies indicating they return on 2026-01-05.

- Jeff Denworth referenced a prior CoreWeave deal where VAST had Andy and Leo working daily from CoreWeave offices, which Jeff credited with generating $1.5B in bookings so far.
