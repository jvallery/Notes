# Microsoft requests Azure VoC for GPU performance testing, Lior plans to decline

**Date**: 2025-12-11

**Project**: [[Cloud]]

**Attendees**: Ray Coetzee, Lior Genzel, Karl Vietmeier, Myself

## Summary

Microsoft requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU instances because their Redmond lab currently lacks GPU nodes. Lior Genzel directed Ray Coetzee to schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft team and stated VAST will decline the request because VAST Azure is not ready for this use case.


## Action Items


- [?] Schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft team who requested an Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing so Lior Genzel can communicate VAST's decision to decline. @Ray Coetzee ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm and document the expected performance profile assumptions for an Azure VoC instance (if needed for internal alignment), in response to Ray Coetzee's question to Karl Vietmeier. @Karl Vietmeier #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- VAST will not provide an Azure VoC instance to Microsoft for GPU performance testing because VAST Azure is not ready for that use case.




## Key Information


- Microsoft has a physical VAST proof-of-concept system installed in Microsoft's lab in Redmond and Microsoft is actively testing it.

- Microsoft's Redmond lab currently does not have GPU nodes available, prompting Microsoft to request an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU instances.

- Lior Genzel stated that VAST will decline Microsoft's request for an Azure VoC instance because VAST Azure is not close to being ready for this type of performance testing.

- Ray Coetzee asked Karl Vietmeier to define the expected performance profile of the Azure VoC instance requested by Microsoft.
