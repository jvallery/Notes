# Ownership and accountability for GDC and Azure Local opportunities

**Date**: 2025-12-01

**Project**: [[Cloud]]

**Attendees**: Karl Vietmeier, Myself

## Summary

Karl Vietmeier flagged growing interest in whether VAST supports Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local, and noted confusion when on-prem teams take ownership once hardware is involved. He recommends cloud product management own these opportunities due to hyperscaler relationships and cloud-consumption alignment, and asked Jason Vallery for guidance on how aggressively to assert ownership and control.


## Action Items


- [?] Provide guidance to Karl Vietmeier on how aggressively cloud product management should assert ownership and how much control Jason Vallery wants to maintain over Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local opportunities. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Clarify and document an internal ownership and accountability model for opportunities involving Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local, specifically defining when cloud product management vs on-prem teams own execution once hardware is involved. @Myself #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Karl Vietmeier is a Cloud Solutions Architect for VAST on Cloud at VAST Data.

- VAST Data is seeing growing interest from the market in whether VAST supports Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local.

- When GDC or Azure Local opportunities involve hardware, VAST on-prem teams tend to take ownership, which creates confusion over accountability and reduces visibility into progress and outcomes for cloud product management.

- Karl Vietmeier believes GDC and Azure Local opportunities should be managed through cloud product management because cloud PM has the strongest hyperscaler relationships and these solutions are expected to be acquired through hyperscalers and tied to cloud consumption.
