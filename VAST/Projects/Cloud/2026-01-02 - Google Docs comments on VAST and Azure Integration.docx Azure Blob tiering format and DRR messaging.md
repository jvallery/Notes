# Google Docs comments on 'VAST and Azure Integration.docx' (Azure Blob tiering format and DRR messaging)

**Date**: 2026-01-02

**Project**: [[Cloud]]

**Attendees**: Jonsi Stefansson

## Summary

A Google Docs notification email captured two open comments from Jonsi Stefansson on the document 'VAST and Azure Integration.docx'. The comments question whether VAST cold data tiering should use VAST object format versus native Azure Blob format, and whether the document should more strongly state how VAST data reduction efficiencies mitigate flash supply chain risk.


## Action Items


- [?] Respond in the 'VAST and Azure Integration.docx' document to Jonsi Stefansson's comment by recommending whether cold data tiering to Azure Blob should use VAST native object format or native Azure Blob format, including tradeoffs for data reduction vs direct Azure Blob readability and ecosystem access. @Myself 📅 2026-01-06 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Propose updated wording for the document section on flash supply constraints to explicitly describe how VAST data reduction efficiencies (DRR) reduce required flash capacity and mitigate component price volatility risk. @Myself 📅 2026-01-06 #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Jonsi Stefansson raised a concern that tiering cold data to Azure Blob using VAST native opaque object format may be undesirable because the data would not be readable directly from Azure Blob, and asked whether the design should instead use native Azure Blob format.

- Jonsi Stefansson suggested strengthening the document's messaging to more firmly state that VAST data reduction and efficiency (DRR) can significantly reduce exposure to flash supply constraints and rising prices.

- The document 'VAST and Azure Integration.docx' includes a statement that cold data can be transparently tiered to Azure Blob using either VAST native opaque formats (for maximum data reduction) or transparent open standard formats (for ecosystem accessibility), positioning this as enabling infinite scale without flash price premium.
