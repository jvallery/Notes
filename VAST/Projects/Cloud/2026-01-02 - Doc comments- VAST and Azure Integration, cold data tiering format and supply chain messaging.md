# Doc comments: VAST and Azure Integration, cold data tiering format and supply chain messaging

**Date**: 2026-01-02

**Project**: [[Cloud]]

**Attendees**: Jonsi Stefansson

## Summary

Google Docs notification from Jonsi Stefansson with two open comments on the document "VAST and Azure Integration.docx". The comments question whether cold data tiering should use VAST object format versus native Azure Blob format, and whether the document should more strongly state how VAST data reduction efficiencies mitigate flash supply chain risk.


## Action Items


- [?] Review the open comment in "VAST and Azure Integration.docx" about cold data tiering format and decide whether the Azure Blob tier should store data in VAST object format (opaque to direct Azure Blob reads) or in native Azure Blob format for direct readability and ecosystem accessibility. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Propose updated wording for "VAST and Azure Integration.docx" to address Jonsi Stefansson's request for a firmer statement on how VAST data reduction efficiencies (DRR) mitigate flash supply chain constraints and rising flash prices. @Myself #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Jonsi Stefansson left an open comment in "VAST and Azure Integration.docx" questioning whether cold data tiering to Azure Blob should use VAST object format (not directly readable from Azure Blob) versus native Azure Blob format for direct readability and ecosystem compatibility.

- Jonsi Stefansson left an open comment in "VAST and Azure Integration.docx" asking whether the document should make a firmer statement that VAST data reduction and efficiency (DRR) significantly reduces exposure to flash supply constraints and rising prices.

- The document text asserts that integrating VAST with Azure Blob enables customers to place the long-tail dataset on HDD-based object storage while reserving VAST flash for the GPU-adjacent working set, as a hedge against flash component price volatility.
