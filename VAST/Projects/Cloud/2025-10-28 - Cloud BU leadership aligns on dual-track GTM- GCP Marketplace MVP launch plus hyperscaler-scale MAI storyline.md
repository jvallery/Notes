# Cloud BU leadership aligns on dual-track GTM: GCP Marketplace MVP launch plus hyperscaler-scale MAI storyline

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Project**: [[Cloud]]
**Attendees**: Jason Vallery, Asaf Levy, Eirikur Hrafnsson, Jonsi Stephenson, Kirstin Bordner, Lior Genzel, Ronnie Lazar, Brian Moore, Shachar, Sahar, Jeff Denworth, Tiffany, Olivia, Ronald Cohen, Kushal Datta, John Downey

## Summary

Cloud BU leadership aligned on a dual-track strategy: ship the GCP MVP via marketplace with strong collateral and demos, while simultaneously pursuing hyperscaler-scale opportunities (notably Microsoft MAI) with a hardware-optimized story and Polaris-managed operations. The team flagged urgent gaps in product marketing collateral, demo readiness for Supercomputing, and operational readiness (QA, support, maintenance handling) as the top launch risks.

## Decisions

- Adopt a dual-track go-to-market strategy: ship the GCP Marketplace MVP for enterprise adoption while simultaneously pursuing hyperscaler-scale first-party opportunities such as Microsoft MAI with a hardware-optimized story and Polaris-managed operations.

- Use routable IPs for the GCP MVP and require customers to provide an IP range during deployment; defer alias IPs and any Google SaaS Runtime approach until after MVP launch.

- Adapt the Enscale solution deck and storyline for Microsoft MAI, emphasizing a Kubernetes-led control plane (Project Apollo) and Polaris for lifecycle management.

- Avoid CoreWeave-style lock-in in any Enscale or neocloud resale model by preserving VAST feature and control exposure.

- Pursue a dual-track go-to-market strategy: ship the GCP MVP via marketplace for enterprise adoption while also pursuing hyperscaler-scale first-party engagements (for example Microsoft MAI) with a hardware-optimized story and Polaris-managed operations.

- Use routable IPs for the GCP MVP deployment model, and defer alias IPs and a Google SaaS Runtime approach until after MVP launch.

- Adapt the Enscale solution deck for Microsoft MAI positioning, emphasizing a Kubernetes-led control plane (Project Apollo) and Polaris for lifecycle management.

- Avoid CoreWeave-style lock-in in any Enscale or Nscale resale arrangement by retaining VAST feature and control exposure contractually and technically.

## Key Information

- Cloud BU leadership agreed to a dual-track go-to-market: (1) ship the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Marketplace MVP for enterprise and marketplace-driven adoption, and (2) pursue hyperscaler-scale first-party opportunities such as Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) with a hardware-optimized story and Polaris-managed operations.

- The GCP Marketplace MVP is close to launch, but the team lacks field-ready collateral (customer deck, internal enablement deck, CSP seller deck, battlecards, datasheets). Product Marketing owner Brian Moore has produced an initial v1 deck and started battlecards, but progress is slow.

- Engineering confirmed the GCP MVP networking approach will use routable IPs, and the deployment flow must collect a customer-provided IP range.

- The team needs an end-to-end GCP demo video showing deployment via Polaris CLI and Polaris UI plus the final deployed state, for Supercomputing and for shared booth presentations with Google and Microsoft.

- Performance data exists for the GCP v1 implementation, approximately 90% of theoretical read performance and 50-60% write performance, but the team has not defined standardized KPIs for field messaging or cross-cloud comparisons.

- The MAI opportunity discussed is on the order of approximately 160,000 GPUs, and Microsoft is asking for VAST guidance; a Friday follow-up session was planned to advance the storyline and architecture.

- Supercomputing conference presence includes a VAST booth plus participation in Google and Microsoft booths, and the team expects about 10 end-user meetings focused on cloud.

- Maintenance and high availability planning for GCP MVP assumes Google scheduled maintenance only, with handling via VM migration and serialization; GCP has 8 failure domains while Azure typically has 3, which impacts redundancy and usable capacity planning.

- Marketplace activation is expected to leverage an existing blanket private offer to avoid new approvals, but pricing components still need tuning.

- Key dates referenced: Microsoft Ignite runs 2025-11-18 to 2025-11-21; AWS re:Invent runs 2025-12-01 to 2025-12-05; a planned Iceland trip was discussed for 2025-12-08.

- Cloud BU leadership agreed to a dual-track go-to-market strategy: (1) ship the GCP MVP via cloud marketplace for enterprise burst use cases, and (2) pursue hyperscaler-scale first-party engagements such as Microsoft MAI with a hardware-optimized story and Polaris-managed operations.

- The GCP MVP networking approach will use routable IPs, and the deployment flow must collect a customer-provided IP range.

- Product Marketing assigned a person named Brian to create GCP MVP collateral (customer deck, internal training deck, CSP seller deck, battlecards, datasheets), but progress has been slow and collateral quality is currently not acceptable for field use.

- Supercomputing conference requires an end-to-end demo video showing GCP deployment via Polaris CLI and Polaris UI, including the final deployed state, for VAST's booth and shared Google and Microsoft booth presentations.

- Jonsi Stephenson stated he would be in Orlando and is handing over for November 17, then attending Microsoft Ignite from 2025-11-18 to 2025-11-21, then AWS re:Invent from 2025-12-01 to 2025-12-05, and expects Jason Vallery and Jeff Denworth to visit Iceland on 2025-12-08.
