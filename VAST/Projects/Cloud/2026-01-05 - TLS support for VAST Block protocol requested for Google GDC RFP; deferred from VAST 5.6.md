# TLS support for VAST Block protocol requested for Google GDC RFP; deferred from VAST 5.6

**Date**: 2026-01-05

**Project**: [[Cloud]]

**Attendees**: Itzik Reich, Noa Cohen, Myself

## Summary

Itzik Reich asked Noa Cohen whether TLS support for VAST Block protocol would ship in VAST release 5.6 because it is a must-have requirement for a Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP. Noa confirmed it was planned for 5.6 but was deferred due to other protocol feature priorities, and asked when Google requires it to consider adding it in a minor release after 5.6. Itzik requested that Jason Vallery engage Google once Maroun provides proposed test timing.


## Action Items


- [?] Engage Google stakeholders for the Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP to confirm required timing and expectations for TLS support for VAST Block protocol, after Maroun provides the proposed test timing. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide Google-required date or deadline for TLS support for VAST Block protocol so engineering can evaluate inclusion in a minor release after VAST 5.6. @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- TLS support for VAST Block protocol will not be included in VAST release 5.6 because it was deferred in favor of other protocol features requested by more customers.




## Key Information


- Itzik Reich is assisting with a Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP and stated that TLS support for VAST Block protocol is a must-have requirement for that RFP.

- Noa Cohen stated that TLS support for VAST Block protocol was planned for VAST release 5.6 but was deferred due to other protocol features requested by more customers.

- Noa Cohen indicated VAST could consider adding TLS support for Block protocol in a minor release after VAST 5.6 if it is confirmed as a must-have requirement, and asked when Google requires it.
