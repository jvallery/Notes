# Google Distributed Cloud RFP debrief and federal coordination (air-gapped focus)

**Date**: 2025-11-14
**Project**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Jason Vallery, Alon Horev, Jennifer Azzolina, Jeremiah Hinrichs, Greg Castellucci, Randy Hayes

## Summary

VAST cloud and federal teams aligned on responding to Google Distributed Cloud's US-based RFP to replace NetApp storage, with a strong emphasis on air-gapped deployments, compliance evidence, and operational readiness. The team agreed on clear owners for Google Federal engagement, RFP content assembly, and a near-term joint validation path leveraging the Fort Meade "Gemini as a service" on-prem initiative.


## Action Items


- [?] Send an intro email connecting Greg Castellucci to Google Distributed Cloud corporate and Google Federal stakeholders and share the RFP package so meetings and Q&A can start immediately. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Assemble RFP supplemental content covering air-gapped compliance and attestations (including DISA STIG expectations if required), encryption and certifications, multi-tenancy model, quotas, tagging integration, and troubleshooting and operations model for Google Distributed Cloud. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Draft recommended Dell and HPE hardware SKUs and deployment patterns suitable for Google Distributed Cloud air-gapped deployments, and include Cisco and commodity VM options where applicable. @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Own and submit the formal Google Distributed Cloud RFP response, coordinating inputs across VAST cloud and federal teams. @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Run point with Google Federal and the corporate Google Distributed Cloud team, coordinate near-term meetings, and drive the joint validation path for the RFP pursuit. @Greg Castellucci #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule and conduct a 1:1 with Muninder Singh Sambi to review AI approach, preferred VM shapes, RDMA requirements, and hardware tradeoffs for Google Distributed Cloud air-gapped deployments. @Alon Horev #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide a list of federal air-gapped customers and obfuscated past performance references that can be used in the Google Distributed Cloud RFP response. @Jennifer Azzolina #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide federal compliance and ATO summaries and links to public artifacts that can be included in the Google Distributed Cloud RFP response without exposing sensitive details. @Jeremiah Hinrichs #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Google and Cisco on Fort Meade rack-and-stack progress and confirm the validation scope and what can be referenced for Q4 in the Google Distributed Cloud RFP. @Greg Castellucci #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Prepare an EBC-style briefing for Google on AI workloads, storage access patterns, and air-gapped operations posture relevant to Google Distributed Cloud. @Randy Hayes #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule an architecture review to decide whether the Google Distributed Cloud solution should be positioned on Dell, HPE, Cisco hardware, or commodity VM deployment, and document the recommended approach for the RFP. @Myself #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Greg Castellucci will run point for engagement with Google Federal and coordinate with the corporate Google Distributed Cloud team for the RFP pursuit and validation motion.

- Jason Vallery will coordinate assembly of the Google Distributed Cloud RFP response content, including required technical and operational details, and will connect Greg Castellucci with relevant Google stakeholders.

- Alon Horev will pursue a 1:1 meeting with Muninder Singh Sambi to cover AI approach, VM shapes, RDMA considerations, and hardware tradeoffs for Google Distributed Cloud air-gapped deployments.

- A person referred to as "Leo" will own the end-to-end formal RFP response submission for Google Distributed Cloud.

- The team will use the Fort Meade "Gemini as a service" on-prem initiative as the primary near-term joint validation path and reference point, subject to what can be cited in the RFP.

- The proposal will include recommended Dell and HPE SKUs and will consider Cisco and commodity VM deployment options as part of the architecture approach.




## Key Information


- Jason Vallery started at VAST Data around late October 2025 (about three weeks before 2025-11-14) and reports to Jeff Denworth, leading product management for cloud and hyperscaler partnerships.

- Jason Vallery previously spent 13 years at Microsoft running product management for Azure Blob Storage.

- Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) provides a GCP-like experience deployed into private or hybrid data centers and includes an air-gapped variant targeted at government customers.

- Google issued a US-based RFP inviting VAST Data to respond as a potential replacement for NetApp as the storage solution for Google Distributed Cloud deployments.

- NetApp is the incumbent storage partner for Google Distributed Cloud, requiring customers to deploy NetApp hardware alongside GDC for file and block storage.

- Google's new GDC leader, Muninder Singh Sambi, is prioritizing air-gapped readiness, compliance posture, operational model, and rapid joint validation with partners.

- Fort Meade "Gemini as a service" on-prem initiative is positioned as an in-flight Q4 validation path that could serve as a near-term joint proof point for VAST Data with Google Distributed Cloud.

- Google Distributed Cloud deployments commonly run on Dell hardware, and have also involved HPE and Cisco gear.

- VAST Federal has active relationships with Google's DoD/IC organization led by Jan Niemus and is coordinating with Cisco on a federal proof of concept motion.

- Randy Hayes previously worked at Avere and is now at VAST Data; Jason Vallery had prior collaboration exposure with the Avere team during its evolution into Azure Managed Cache-related efforts.
