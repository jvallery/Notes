# Google Distributed Cloud RFP debrief and federal coordination (air-gapped focus)

**Date**: 2025-11-14
**Project**: [[Cloud]]
**Attendees**: Jason Vallery, Alon Horev, Jennifer Azzolina, Jeremiah Hinrichs, Greg Castellucci, Randy Hayes

## Summary

VAST cloud and federal teams aligned on responding to Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP to replace NetApp storage, with a strong focus on air-gapped deployments, compliance evidence, and operational readiness. The team agreed on clear owners for Google Federal engagement, RFP content assembly, and a 1:1 with new GDC leader Muninder Singh Sambi, and plans to use the Fort Meade "Gemini as a service" on-prem effort as a near-term joint validation path.

## Action Items

- [?] Send an intro email connecting Greg Castellucci to Google GDC corporate and Google Federal stakeholders and share the GDC RFP package. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Assemble GDC RFP supplemental materials covering compliance and attestations (including DISA STIG expectations if required), encryption and certifications, multi-tenancy, quotas, tagging integration, and troubleshooting and operations model for air-gapped deployments. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Own and submit the formal end-to-end Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP response, coordinating inputs across VAST teams (confirm whether owner is Leo or Lior Genzel). @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Run point with Google Federal and Google corporate GDC teams, coordinate near-term meetings, and drive the joint validation path for the GDC RFP pursuit. @Greg Castellucci #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule an architecture review to decide whether the Google Distributed Cloud solution should be positioned on Dell, HPE, Cisco hardware, or commodity VM deployment, and document the recommended approach for the RFP. @Myself #task #proposed #auto

## Decisions

- Greg Castellucci will run point for engagement with Google Federal and coordinate with Google’s corporate Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) team for the RFP pursuit over the next few weeks.

- Jason Vallery will coordinate assembly of the Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP response content and connect Greg Castellucci with the relevant Google stakeholders.

- Alon Horev will schedule and conduct a 1:1 with Muninder Singh Sambi to discuss AI approach, preferred VM shapes, RDMA requirements, and hardware tradeoffs for GDC deployments.

- A person referred to as "Leo" will own the end-to-end formal GDC RFP response and submission, coordinating inputs across VAST teams (owner identity needs confirmation).

- VAST will use the Fort Meade "Gemini as a service" on-prem initiative as the primary near-term joint validation path and reference for the GDC RFP response.

- The RFP response will include recommended Dell and HPE hardware SKUs and will consider Cisco hardware and commodity VM deployment options.

- Greg Castellucci will run point for engagement with Google Federal and coordinate with the corporate Google Distributed Cloud team for the RFP pursuit and validation motion.

- Jason Vallery will coordinate assembly of the Google Distributed Cloud RFP response content, including required technical and operational details, and will connect Greg Castellucci with relevant Google stakeholders.
