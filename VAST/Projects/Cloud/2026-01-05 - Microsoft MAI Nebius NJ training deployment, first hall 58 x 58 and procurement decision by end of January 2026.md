# Microsoft MAI Nebius NJ training deployment, first hall 58 x 58 and procurement decision by end of January 2026

**Date**: 2026-01-05

**Project**: [[Cloud]]

**Attendees**: Lior Genzel, Moshe Pinto, Rick Scurfield, Regina (last name unknown), Ray (last name unknown)

## Summary

Lior Genzel shared operational details for a Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) training deployment planned for the Nebius New Jersey data center, scaling to 812 x 812 at full build-out and starting with a first-hall 58 x 58 phase. The team is pushing for a near-term decision between VAST Data and Azure Blob, targeting a procurement decision before 2026-01-31, while supply chain constraints (NAND and 800G switches) remain key risks.


## Action Items


- [?] Check whether Microsoft can source their own 800 Gigabit switches for the MAI Nebius New Jersey deployment, given VAST Data's quote does not include switches due to lack of 800G switches in the price book. @Lior Genzel ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Share an organized package of configuration and project details for the Microsoft MAI Nebius New Jersey deployment, after coordinating with Ray (UK) on how flexible VAST Data's configuration can be. @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-05 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Add the potential March 2026 57 x 57 configuration for the Microsoft opportunity to the Soft Backlog list (initially as soft backlog until it firms up). @TBD #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm the Salesforce opportunity number for the Microsoft MAI Nebius New Jersey deployment and communicate it to internal stakeholders who asked (Moshe Pinto). @Lior Genzel #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Pursue a software purchase order that covers the full scope of the Microsoft MAI Nebius New Jersey project (beyond first hall hardware) under Salesforce opportunity Opp-17629. @TBD 📅 2026-01-31 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Decision pending between deploying VAST Data versus using Azure Blob (Microsoft's original plan) for the MAI training deployment at the Nebius New Jersey data center.

- Target to reach a decision in the coming business days to enable a procurement decision before 2026-01-31.




## Key Information


- Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) training deployment at the Nebius New Jersey data center is planned to scale to an 812 x 812 configuration at full build-out.

- The MAI Nebius New Jersey deployment is designed to be installed in phases, with the first phase requiring hardware for one hall and a 58 x 58 setup.

- Latest update as of 2026-01-05: Microsoft expects to install the first hall of the Nebius New Jersey MAI deployment in the May/June 2026 timeframe, then move aggressively to the other 13 halls before the end of 2026.

- VAST Data triggered urgency with Microsoft MAI due to severe supply chain constraints and is running a parallel evaluation of whether the deployment can be done on Microsoft hardware (Azure Blob or Azure Compute) or using Microsoft NAND supply chain.

- Salesforce opportunity Opp-17629 currently calls out only the hardware for the first hall of the Microsoft MAI Nebius New Jersey deployment.

- Plan for Salesforce opportunity Opp-17629 is to request a software purchase order that covers the full scope of the Microsoft MAI Nebius New Jersey project, not just the first hall hardware.

- The current Salesforce quote for the Microsoft MAI Nebius New Jersey deployment does not include switches because 800 Gigabit switches are not available in VAST Data's price book.

- Lior Genzel stated he will check whether Microsoft can source their own 800 Gigabit switches for the MAI Nebius New Jersey deployment; the same supply chain concern applies to NAND.

- Rick Scurfield told Regina (last name unknown) that Lior Genzel mentioned a possible need to ship a 57 x 57 configuration in March 2026 for the Microsoft opportunity, and that it was not visible on the Hard/Soft Backlog list at the time.

- Rick Scurfield noted that VAST Data might try to source hardware from Dell for the Microsoft opportunity, but recent information suggested that may not be possible, so Regina should be prepared to make accommodations if needed.
