# Microsoft workback plan, CoreWeave MFN comparison, and TCO model refinement

**Date**: 2026-01-05

**Project**: [[Cloud]]

**Attendees**: Jonsi Stefansson, Erik Wolf, Jeff Denworth, Lior Genzel, Helen Protopapas, Rick Scurfield, Myself

## Summary

Internal VAST thread coordinating a Microsoft workback plan, including a CoreWeave MFN-driven pricing comparison and a request to break out hardware vs software components for Microsoft. Erik Wolf and Jason Vallery start a financial analysis using a spreadsheet model, while Jeff Denworth asks the team to refine a full TCO model including power and opportunity cost, with urgency to be ready for Davos.


## Action Items


- [?] Complete financial analysis spreadsheet for the Microsoft workback plan with adjustable assumptions ('all the knobs') and validate scenarios requested by Jonsi Stefansson (Azure bare metal software-only vs VAST ODM hardware plus software). @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide Microsoft-ready breakdown of CoreWeave pricing components, including hardware vs software split where possible, and clarify that only software pricing is currently locked in with CoreWeave. @Erik Wolf ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Refine the Microsoft TCO model to include power consumption and the opportunity cost/value of lower power to Microsoft, not just COGS. @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule a discussion with Jeff Denworth and Erik Wolf to review the updated spreadsheet model and TCO assumptions (Erik suggested tonight or Tuesday morning). @Myself 📅 2026-01-06 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- CoreWeave contract includes a most-favored-nation (MFN) clause and some level of exclusivity, which VAST expects Microsoft to scrutinize in competitive comparisons.

- Erik Wolf stated that VAST only locked in a software pricing model with CoreWeave (no full hardware plus software split locked in).

- Erik Wolf provided a price point of $3.60 per TB per month in the Microsoft workback plan thread (context: pricing discussion tied to list price discount).

- Erik Wolf stated that before a recent price hike, the list price discount was about 94.9%.

- Jeff Denworth requested an understanding of the MFN clause and MFN price with CoreWeave to support Microsoft negotiations.

- Jeff Denworth asked the team to refine a total cost of ownership (TCO) model beyond COGS, including power and the opportunity cost value of lower power consumption to Microsoft.

- Erik Wolf and Jason Vallery started a financial analysis using a spreadsheet model to evaluate multiple scenarios for the Microsoft workback plan.

- Erik Wolf stated that Jason Vallery already had a chunk of the analysis done and they incorporated it into the latest spreadsheet model to gut-check assumptions.

- Jonsi Stefansson requested a full hardware and software split for CoreWeave to present to Microsoft, including (1) VAST software on Azure Storage SKUs bare metal with Microsoft hardware and software-only $/TB/month, and (2) VAST ODM hardware plus VAST software with the split.

- Jeff Denworth indicated urgency to have the Microsoft competitive and TCO story 'buttoned up' for Davos, contingent on Lior Genzel's claim that VAST may be competing with Microsoft's storage team.
