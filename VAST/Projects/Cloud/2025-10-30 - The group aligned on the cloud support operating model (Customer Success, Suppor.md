# 20251030 0846 Parallels Transcription

**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Participants:** Jason Vallery, Lior, Yancey, Rob Banga, Daniel, Timo, Christina

## Summary

The group aligned on the cloud support operating model (Customer Success, Support, SRE), hyperscaler priorities, and phased marketplace rollout, targeting operational readiness by 2026-02-01. Key workstreams include staffing (SRE, 24/7 support), Salesforce/Tackle/Polaris integrations, data governance/compliance, and enablement/documentation. GCP challenged TPU test results; a review meeting is being set up.

## Key facts learned

- Hyperscaler priority: GCP first, Azure second, AWS third.
- Phases: Private offers start ~2 months from now; public offers 6–8 months later; full SaaS targeted FY28.
- Support model split: proactive Customer Success, reactive Support, and 24/7 SRE on-call.
- Initial cloud delivery is deployed in the customer tenant; no hardware; significant networking complexity expected.
- Readiness target for support machine: 2026-02-01.
- Tackle will integrate with Salesforce; Polaris is the source of truth for metering and billing.
- Metering cadence: hourly utilization; aggregates fed to hyperscalers and ERP.
- Data and analytics (Tableau) needed for churn, feature usage, and forecasting.
- Legal/compliance: data custodian obligations for SaaS, SOC2/FedRAMP path to be defined.
- Candidate customers: Microsoft (incl. MAI), UKMET (via Microsoft), NBCU, Sigma, Jump Trading, Citadel; Zoom exploring on AWS.
- Enablement/doc needed for end-customer and sell-to-hyperscaler motions.
- GCP challenged TPU test results (~23% better than Managed Lustre in their view); meeting next Tuesday with Nirav and Rich Shanshee.

## Outcomes

- Aligned on CS/Support/SRE roles and 24/7 support desk requirement for cloud.
- Agreed to prepare a simple, clear support/SRE/CS plan and review with this group.
- Agreed to start recruiting key SRE/support talent immediately.
- Identified Carl as a potential initial leader for implementation/support.
- Confirmed Tackle–Salesforce–Polaris integration as a gating item for marketplace operations.
- Confirmed need to scope analytics in Tableau for cloud customer telemetry and churn/usage views.
- Confirmed SKO will include cloud enablement content.

## Decisions

- Prioritize hyperscalers: GCP first, Azure second, AWS third.
- Proceed with phased rollout: private offer → public offer (6–8 months later) → SaaS in FY28.
- Adopt separated functions for Customer Success, Support, and SRE with 24/7 support coverage.
- Target operational readiness by 2026-02-01.

## Risks

- Salesforce data hygiene and role-based access design may lag needs, impacting customer experience.
- Networking complexity likely increases ticket volume versus on-prem expectations.
- G&A capacity constraints (legal, compliance, ops, analytics) could delay readiness.
- Unclear data custodian obligations/compliance certifications for SaaS could create legal exposure.
- Limited cloud skills in current team; hiring delays could miss the Feb 1 readiness target.
- Integration dependencies (Tackle ↔ Salesforce ↔ Polaris) are gating and complex.

## Open questions

- Will the support/SRE organization be net-new hires or partially staffed from existing teams?
- Who will formally lead the initial cloud implementation/support team (pending Carl’s interest/fit)?
- What additional Salesforce/Tableau licenses and configurations are required for launch?
- What is the definitive data custodian stance and certification roadmap (SOC2, FedRAMP) and timing?
- How will role-based access and data segmentation be modeled across Salesforce, Polaris, and support tooling?
- Exact timeline for private and public marketplace offers by hyperscaler and dependencies (Tackle integration readiness).
- Final overage thresholds and pricing mechanics for private offers.
- What are the specific SKO enablement deliverables and owners across Sales, SEs, Support, and CS?

[00:00:00.00]   RemoteYeah. Yeah. Hey, Jason, Leor, Daniel, we'll give everybody else a few moments to assemble. just checking yeah he's a yes yep all right we'll give people a few minutes We're just giving folks a few minutes to assemble. We definitely need Rob Banga. I'll send him a ping. >> Hey, for Jason and Lior, we just got challenged by -- GCP on our TPU test results, so they want to have a meeting with me and Kartik next Tuesday to go over how the test was exactly set up because they're, yeah, they're, let's say that they're-- sort of questioning our test results because it's 23% better than the Managed Lustre that they have today.

[00:02:04.91]  Jason ValleryThat's good news, as long as we can defend it.

[00:02:08.69]   RemoteIt's good news, but I don't think we compared anything to Managed Lustre. We compared it to... manage SSD drive not to manage luster. I know but they did the similar test on their managed luster and they got so. Interesting. It's Shansi that I know really well he's had his reports directly to Nirav. He's an old Nathabur. way back when, and when we did the first-party offering in Google, we worked pretty closely with him. He is attending the meeting and Karthik is joining me on the meeting, just going over how it was tested. Sounds like a too-good-to-be-true kind of challenge, which is a good time to have, I guess. Yeah, I was just, poor Kartik is on vacation in India and I just jumped on a call with him after I got the meeting invite from Nirav and Rich Shanshee to go over the test results. Fair enough. Well, hey, Rob, thank you for joining us. We should dive in. Amy are likely held up. So even if we just cover support, I think we're fine. Just quickly setting some context. This is, I don't know, maybe the fourth review or so of the reviews that we agreed on from the AOP kickoff meeting. These have been super helpful. I think definitely helpful for everybody else in the company to understand. the thinking on hyperscalers and then to start to think about how to support, and so, yeah, basically, Rob, just for context, what we've been doing is really just getting kind of a download from Yancey and Lior and Jason on, you know, what their thoughts are for the hyperscaler business and thinking on what's needed. in this case, from a customer support perspective. So, you know, I'd say that maybe whoever wants to lead off, be good to just get an overview and then we can dive in where we need to. - I mean, from my perspective, Rob, like we have. talked about like having are we going to be utilizing the current customer success or customer support staff from on-prem or are we going to set up dedicated cloud customer success just for AOP purposes? I see. Got it. Seems like we should leverage the existing pool of people that already know what's going on and then ramp them up on the cloud peculiarities. I think

[00:05:03.77]  Jason ValleryThere's a timeline component too because once you get to SaaS it's a full-blown SRE kind of role because folks have to manage the infrastructure, manage deployments. in a more, well, in a multi-tenant way, right? They're responsible for the success of multiple customers simultaneously. So I view that as a little different than, and I'm new here, so I don't fully understand our customer success work, but I did meet with some of the team, and it feels like it's much more an alignment between individual and customer, and really more workload enablement than it is end-to-end ownership. So there's probably some nuance around how that role gets defined there.

[00:05:40.14]   RemoteIt might be helpful just to, just as framing too, and this is from the discussions we've had on the other topics so far on hyperscaler, the general Rob, just so you understand the kind of phase one or five solutions is the marketplace launches that are going to start occurring from about two. from now, and those are going to be private offer, meaning negotiated outside of the marketplace and kind of direct with the customers, and so quite similar to how things are done today with on-prem. Phase two, which would be six to eight months following that, would be a public offer, and so that would be basically transacted via the marketplace and then the third phase under consideration which you probably remember from the kickoff deck was the full SaaS offering that Jason's referring to where it's a really different ballgame and yeah managing the capacity etc and the current thinking on that is that would be an FY 28 activity. Got it. So during 1.27, we might need to think about how to prepare for that, but we wouldn't be launching that. Got it. Okay. Thank you, and let me just say one question. It was just like any differences in support between the private offer and public offer? No, that's exactly the same. It's both deployed within the customer tenant, and then of course to Jason's point, when we go for the SaaS, it's going to be more of a site reliability engineering role or a city role. Yeah. Yeah, I think there are scenarios where like, for example, expanding the multi-tenant cluster and, you know, there are scenarios where we might enter a multi-tenant cluster. noisy neighbor, especially when we start introducing more compute-heavy capabilities like the database and the Kafka engine, the function as a service and all of that, that then, you know, potentially having to migrate from one cluster to another. another to load balance the clusters I mean of course we are going to automate as much of it as we can but there is always going to be some level of you know fine-tuning. Which hyperscalers are we targeting first? The big three. TCP first, Azure second, AWS third. got it and so I see that priority that priority just changed in the last couple of weeks because of the pent-up demand and large opportunities in usher so if

[00:08:30.55]  Jason ValleryI could kind of walk through the way I see the three distinct roles because I think there's customer success support in SRE and they each have their own responsibility. I see customer success is proactive engagement. So working with a customer on making sure they're following best practices, how to use the platform, how to get the most out of the platform. I see support is reactive in the sense that some operational issue, we're not hitting SLAs, and the customer is bringing our attention to challenge, and then I said, SRE is the folks that are on the hook to go and make sure that the platform is delivering on expectations. They're in a 24/7 call rotation, monitoring the platform, proactively fixing issues like, you know, Yancey alluded to, where there's noisy neighbor problems, and then receiving input from the support team if things are broken, they're the break/fix team. At Microsoft, the way this would have worked is the engineers that built it would be on a rotation.

[00:09:34.66]   RemoteThat's music to my ears.

[00:09:36.66]  Jason ValleryYeah.

[00:09:37.86]   RemoteI love it. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks, Jason. Jason, you and I should spend some time together. offline together. I would love to pick your brain a little bit on this. Yeah. Having come from having come from OCI, a lot of this sounds familiar, and so I think there will be, it'll be different. It'll be different for this beast to do CS support in SRE. We're not used to doing that. So I'm excited to build. I mean, from From my perspective, probably the highest rewarding or commission-based sellers in cloud in three of my previous companies or previous lives has always been customer success that is actually doing most of the upselling. It's very much land and expand motion and to what Jason was saying, it's basically making sure that they are doing and getting the most out of the platform, but also upselling into other capabilities and really monitor what's happening with each one of the customer. a drastic attrition from one particular customer. Is that a normal behavior based on the spikes that they have or is it something to do with the system and then customer success comes in and says like, "Hey, how can we help you? What's going on with your deployment or whatever?" love it what is the like you have a team today so what is the plan to be able to start supporting this type of new installations in cloud once we move forward I don't have an answer I don't have a pat answer for you right now I need to I need to process through this I need to chat with Jason a little bit The way we're built today is not how we need to be built for tomorrow. So I don't know that I can go through horn some people from my existing organization into this new model. Maybe I can. I need to think about it. This is this is a totally different model. This is a model that I've been wanting to implement here with us. are using CS people and support people and developers being on rotation 24/7. This all makes sense to me. Okay, so when we talk to end users and to salespeople, clearly they care about support. They care to understand that they know how to support it, but I'll give you a discount. I think that we will need this to be up and running as a machine on the 1st of February. next year. The discount is that in the next few months, we're going to be very, you know, centralized on a few projects that are going to be key projects for our success, and we're going to have all hands on deck from engineering as well. So you have the time to prep, to decide, to prep, to hire and to train. But at that point in time, two months forward, December, January, two to three months forward, we need to be ready for the mask that's going off site. Makes sense. Okay. Yeah, and I was going to say, this is clearly a very different model from current state. It is. It is. One thing that we need to think about, Rob, is, and more broadly for cloud solutions overall, is just, you know, what do we do when and how do we kind of stage and then walk as we go and as we launch. So. - Okay. - Rob, do you have, like I know some of these questions were from you and I know you had asked some questions in Slack as well. Do you have what you need in terms of an understanding of what- - Yeah. Yeah. well and it helps gcp first azure second aws third um the model makes sense um do we have any target customers that we think we're going to hit first uh yancey or leor specific names of customers yeah so yeah right now when we look at microsoft we're specifically looking at microsoft themselves as a customer as a potential first project MAI we're looking at UKMET which is an external customer but Microsoft won the project so it's again working with Microsoft themselves these are the hottest potatoes and when we look at Microsoft there is also NBCU forward these are the names at Google it rotating but I would say the biggest discusses to Sigma, but there are a few others that are actively asking and discussing like jump trading and citadel and others. So, you know, we're now trying to push them to push the trigger and move into into a proof of concept, and with Amazon, there is a list nothing is kind of, you know, especially or small, there is a list of notes. right now there is Zoom that are exploring but also we don't have a plan or committed plan to support it yet. So the link is still active but right now I think yes most of the attention is going to Microsoft because of the big projects and the fact that they're seriously talking about moving forward effectively immediately. So that's where we are, and remember that we didn't educate the Salesforce. We're like having those conversations because we didn't push on the Salesforce to promote it with all customers, and once we do it, it will change. It will be much, much bigger. The pipeline is on hold in a way. - Yeah. - Okay. - Okay. - So Rob, this is actually, we'll work together on. Laying out what this looks like. Yeah Yeah, these are My first reaction to all of this is these are net new people because I'm gonna need skill set in GCP Azure and AWS And OCI so the SREs that you hire ideally are from those places The first iteration of the product when it's a managed vast cluster in the customer tenant, I would say it's 70% vast DNA, 30% cloud DNA. So I agree with you that they need to know something else, but we're still installing clusters for Polaris in the customer tenant, and most of the troubleshooting and the adoption, it's local namespace and it's, you know, an e-books cluster being installed. Moving into SaaS, 100% I agree with you, everything changes, but I think you can have an hybrid of, at least the way I saw it on the go-to-market team is 50/50. Some people in that team need to really know Vaas and some people really need to know Cloud and they can complement each other. That's the way I see it. Yeah, I think that makes sense. I don't know that I have any stall. and cloud skill set on my current people. I might have bits and pieces here or there, but nothing really good. I feel like I can, I can teach a hyperscaler purge and some bad stuff and then augment them with fast as opposed to the other way around. Okay. just to confirm, there's no hardware or installation related activities that are required. Shout if that's different, and then the second question would be, as a result of that, would there then, should we expect essentially like a lower ticket count on average from a customer? Because for our current customers. a portion of those are hardware related?

[00:17:17.56]  Jason Vallery- I would imagine a lot of friction around networking. So yes, on your point of, obviously there's no hardware in play, at least on the cloud side. There's a lot of networking complexity in this kind of solution. I would imagine somebody who has a deep understanding of how all of that works in relation to the cloud, particularly if these are burst scenarios which I think is sort of our initial offer, that'll be where I would imagine we'll see an increase in tickets compared to our experience on-prem. So I don't necessarily see it as a reduction in ticket volume. I see it as a different kind of ticket. Yeah. Interesting. Okay.

[00:17:53.89]   RemoteYou know, if we need to be in place by February 1st, it'd be who? me to start recruiting for these people even though we don't need them immediately start recruiting for them now so I can find the unicorn superstars the first couple of hires will need to be really solid yeah so one person in my team is more the process specialist it's called right so we need to discuss it maybe it makes sense for Carl to be the leader of this team on your side. So is right now, if you think about support and customer success, is right now the only hands-on person before it gets straight to engineering?

[00:18:33.75]  Jason Vallery- Well, let's also talk about customer success. Do we see that as one person, or do we have a support queue? Because that's a 24/7 role, even in the marketplace scenario. we still need a 24/7 response desk, because customer testimony is not a 24/7 role, it's proactive customer engagement. True statement, true statement.

[00:18:55.91]   RemoteFair enough. So I'm talking about mostly, I'm talking about implementation and support, not about customer success, right? So Carl right now is the guy that is the go-to person to install and implement. and to support the portraits as they move forward so troubleshooting technical hands-on um is good so well that is really good so maybe it makes sense for him to start the team on your side we need to check that it works for him as well but uh just an idea and and hiring this sre so Jason it sounds like you know it needs to work so So we'd love to see all that organization. Now I have a question. None of this conversation is not related to pre-sales, right? So pre-sales is completely different group and different type of people. Is that correct? - That's Benoit's team, isn't it? - Even the SEs would be part of a different group. - Okay, so we also need to see that there is a clear plan of getting them on board on everything because right now they're not yeah that was i don't know if you were part of that call we had a call and go to market with uh rick and rick and marianne at least i think but i was i was on the call i'm not sure there was an action item that there so i don't know if that was uh discussed yeah are we talking about this at a scale Are we going to talk about this at SKO? At SKO, 100 percent. Okay, got it, all right. All right, so it sounds like on support, um, that's a helpful download, uh, next step is, Rob, we just need to put together a plan. Very simple. Yeah. Not elaborate, but clear, and then sort of... with this group, get feedback, and then determine where we go from there. It sounds like we may have a candidate already. Yeah. Great. Yeah. Uh, cool. Um, and then ops, obviously, uh, no activity needed. Um, we then have GNA essentially, and so, um, here, I think there's a, there's a couple of different elements. It's kind of broad and so we can tackle these in any order that makes sense. You know, we've put systems and data infrastructure at the top. I know, Yancey, you've brought up Tackle. It might help to just, you know, maybe just get a download from, you know, you've gotten to know the systems and data infrastructure. at vast a bit you know what's you've raised tackle what's on your mind is there anything else what do we need to be aware of on the on the tackle or specifically or anything else anything else so the category of kind of systems and data infrastructures So you can see some of the questions here like software systems, tooling needs, you know, where are we going to need changes in SFDC, NetSuite, Bamboo, et cetera, you know, usage consumption data and so on. So just the broad category. Yeah, I mean, I don't think we have to do anything in the HR system of Bamboo specifically for. or but I Mean one of one of the sort of Gating factors is of course the integration with taco to our salesforce The other thing is how do we you register and take the information from salesforce register and and register the correct customer in the correct manner so it's actually an on-premise customer and a cloud customer or a hybrid customer sees all of his deployed clusters whether it's deployed on-prem or in the or in a hyperscaler of choice so that's that's something that integration with Polaris or how Polaris and Tackle are communicating how it's communicating to Salesforce so I mean I think the only change to here is Salesforce and if there's any additional licenses or something that we need need in Salesforce in order to achieve this. I just don't have the-- Yeah, and when you're talking about a customer, the on-prem or cloud, what's the data that's stored? What do the support people know about it in Salesforce, all that stuff? There's a bunch of minutiae. There's a ton of minutiae in there. This audience doesn't care about that. But there is a lot of minutiae that we have to make sure perfect. Otherwise, the customer experience will be bad. Yep.

[00:23:41.26]  Jason ValleryDo we have, um, I mean, one of the things that will come into play here is what kinds of, I'll use the word entanglements, that's probably not the right word, but maybe roles is better. Um, each individual stakeholder at a customer has access to meaning like who I, who's the support contacts, who's allowed to raise supply. request to concede telemetry data in order to allow customers to segment information around within their own organizations. It's certainly one of the key capabilities we've had to bring at Microsoft is saying this group of people are allowed to see this bit of information. How do we think about that in a cohesive way across all of these different platforms like tackle and you know what kinds of support tooling we give and what kinds of like monitoring. and telemetry and tooling we give?

[00:24:24.87]   Remote- Yeah.

[00:24:28.19]  Jason Vallery- Is there customer registration in Salesforce that we track and manage roles?

[00:24:32.37]   Remote(laughing) - It is a valid question. The answer is not a beautiful one. - Yeah. - Yeah, we're gonna have to get good at this. stuff in terms of sales force data hygiene what the rules are for data entry and then also automated validation our onboarding processes will have to change yeah there's a bunch of there's there's a lot of nuance here okay we're not going to be able to our way of kind of of scrappily hacking things together, I don't know is gonna work well in this situation. We kind of have to hit the ground running and be perfect on day one. Otherwise it'll be super messy.

[00:25:21.60]  Jason Vallery- I mean, a good segue to my point that I just made in your next bullet, Timo, around legal is you know, who's allowed to see what, you know. One of the things that we also ran into, particularly as a data storage platform, was you seeing customer data, and you have to, first of all, define what customer data even means, and I'll say, like, Microsoft's lawyers were very aggressive in their definition to include even the name of a folder or a file that a customer that could be considered governed by various compliance attestations, rules that Microsoft would then go and say we're certifying our platform meets these industry or country specific regulations and then therefore like we had to ensure all of our support engineer our sales team you know we're that information in order to make sure we were compliant with those various check marks.

[00:26:22.12]   RemoteYeah, makes sense, and maybe quickly just to sum up on the software systems tooling side of things before we move on to legal. So it sounds like essentially tackle end integrations. with the various existing systems, as well as just an overall increase in rigors is primarily what it is for FY20. - Well, I mean, yeah. - Go ahead. - Definitely, I want to be able to utilize the analytics that Joe has, you know, in. Tableau to actually show customer churn, customer feature utilization, what capabilities are they actually using. I want to have a real clear view into each one of our cloud customers and that is also going to be super relevant for customer success for. customer support and the SRE. So that is something that I will have to work with Johan on what data we need to be pushing to Tableau. - Yeah, makes sense. If you want to take a note of that. There's a bunch of data governance stuff. I think this is what Jason just said. There's a bunch of data governance stuff that we have to figure out. Data governance and presentation of different information than we're used to presenting, and to different teams, right, Rob? I mean, customer success is an entirely different view than, you know, we're providing today, right, more proactive, you know, um, visibility. So that's, that's all, you know, we're going to have to build this and staff it accordingly to, to, to build, to build that. Yeah. I mean, and, uh, on, on, on from an AOP perspective. perspective, are any additional licenses needed for Tableau, any additional seats, are there any additional things that we have to license for in Salesforce? I mean, that is something that will basically just have to come up. Yep. Yep. Makes a lot of sense, and Daniel, yeah, you can... Make sure you're taking these down, makes sense. - I have, I just had a request for Christina because she's supposed to take the follow up with talking about Salesforce to understand how it works. She will try to set something for tomorrow and then we'll get back to you with feedback, and I need to jump on another call with Google about supercomputing, so come on guys. OK, thanks, Lior. Great. So legal, we talked about compliance, data governance, access rights, and so on. Any other-- anything else specific? I think, at least for the first marketplace launch, it sounds like it'll be-- fairly straightforward. I think, obviously, we'll just have the volume increase of contracts,

[00:29:47.00]  Jason ValleryBut anything else we should be thinking about? I mean, the thing that makes me worry a bit, and I'm not sure how this works today for fast on-prem customers, but we become data custodians. When this becomes in our control versus being in the customers control, we're a data custodian, and that with it comes certain customer expectations around promises related to data durability, security controls, isolation, and so I think it's appropriate for us to have done a review of what commitments we're making to the customer there, and if we're explicitly you know, giving them some sort of data protection, data processing agreement that says, you know, VAST is my data custodian and I'm entrusting you to these commitments and obligations, and if you fail, here are the consequences to VAST. Does that, I mean, I'm naive here. Does that exist today in our current licensing for on-prem customers? a custodian there, and then how does that evolve for a cloud?

[00:30:48.85]   RemoteI'm just going to put that on the list of things that have to be reviewed since there's no legal representation on this call, but you have to keep in mind as an on-prem, we don't take custody of the customer's data so if this you know if we're talking about an entirely new model then yes we'll we'll have to change a lot I mean one thing that automatically changes when you go from to being deployed in the customer to SaaS, it's a totally different EULA or end-user license agreement that the customer signs. I presume we'll need to go down the path of SOC2, FedRAMP, all of those various certifications, right? And that's going to enforce a meaningful amount of control. we're going to need to both that looks like and then execute against, and we're having this meeting right now because it's AOP time, but we're also trying to, you know, help Renan understand this isn't just hiring a team in Iceland and, um, and a bunch of people on Leora's team. There, there's an. infrastructure layer that has to be built here that requires resourcing, we already have G&A functions that are incredibly stretched right now, so this needs to get included as part of the plan in order to make sure that you're adequately resourced, and Daniel, I don't know, I think the screen may be not updating for me, but we should just be capturing all of these things, including the need for legal and compliance resources to support. - Yeah. - Okay. - I'm taking notes on my end. - Oh, okay, great. All right, so we covered systems, software tooling, we covered legal. You know, on the finance data report. I think, honestly, some of those questions are just for us, Yancey, as we talked about maybe on our one-on-one chat. Although, I would say when we start to get into consumption model, there will be a meaningful uptick in terms of—and this may be Joe, I think we've already talked about this—in terms of data and analytics and building— our ability to forecast because that would be just a different dynamic. So I don't know that we need to spend time here beyond just cognizant that we need reporting that's specific for this and data that's specific for this and that you and I, Joe, need to make sure we resource appropriately for that. Right. I'm alive. Yeah, other, I mean, other, is there any area that we haven't covered, you know, that you would put under support or GNA that we should? Yancey, quick question, and sorry for my ignorance. in terms of how this will work in a marketplace environment versus when we do our own cloud offering. How will the metering, in terms of monitoring and measuring customer usage or consumption, work? Will it be reliant upon functionality sitting inside the hyperscaler? or will we have our own metering and measurement engine that drives usage and ultimate recognition and billing from a revenue standpoint? And there's a lot of implications to all of this. So I'm just trying to kind of get a sense of, I think in a private offer, it's relatively simple, right? Fixed capacity, fixed term. - Yeah. We did talk about overages, right, and potentially getting built into that, and then PAYGO, and then, you know, eventually full blown SaaS. All the logic resides within Polaris, or the service delivery platform. So we are the ones that are the source of truth, and we are actually one that is... providing that to the hyperscalers to build, and we will be providing that to a platform of your choice, whatever ERP system that you're using today, we can basically push all of that from Payco. The way we are doing the measurements, that's a requirement from the clouds, we're doing it on an hourly basis. basis, you know, the utilization is reported on an hourly basis, and then we can accumulate it all together and send to you in a monthly or weekly, whatever you prefer. That's basically just how you guys want to be able to. our projections for cloud and how each customer is growing or shrinking depending on what's going on, all that logic, all the building logic, all the metrics are being built into Polaris. - We can set up separate time, that's not immediate, right? Like we don't need to deal with that as far as the current private offer. But there's, yeah, there's a lot there that we're gonna need to integrate and build to automate as much as possible, and then, you know, unfortunately in the world of public company internal controls, there's gonna be a ton of. of importance as it relates to that metering engine 'cause it is the only evidence of actual delivery to our customers, and so our auditors are gonna wanna dig into that as well. So we're gonna just need to spend some time on that as we move forward. - Yeah, I mean, we built that multiple times specifically for auditors. and how that and how that needs to be formatted but I mean we'll just have to collaborate I mean like you said in the beginning in the MVP where the entitlements are fixed so you can have like you have a fixed capacity that you're paying for whether you use it or not and then we are working on the overages you're allowed to temporarily go 10% above or whatever we decide on, and then if it prolongs, it will be charged per list price, just like Jason set it up or was basically communicating. Then we have to start working on how we're going to do our SaaS pricing model and business model. - Right, to measure all the various components of usage. - Yeah, maybe just a quick foreshadow on that. Very early discussion, so no action to be taken, but just so you're aware, Jason, one model that we're starting to talk about is basically having essentially, like vast units. So a vast bit, which would be good for making it up, you know, X amount of terabytes of storage, Y amounts of compute might be worth different amounts in different areas for different use cases, different, et cetera, but you'd get a, like a bucket of units, and then you could use those on-prem, you could use them on cloud, et cetera. The unit cost the same, but how it gets utilized, the consumption mechanism is different.

[00:39:08.31]  Jason ValleryYou publish a matrix of multipliers that get applied to the unit based on the environment and based on the scenario or use case, you could charge more for hot active data sets and less for archived data sets and so forth, and that retains the flexibility. and ensures we're getting fair revenue recovery across all of the scenarios.

[00:39:27.10]   Remote- Two things that are nice about that, just to make the note while we're on the topic. One, it's nice for the customer because it's like, yeah, it's very, it's very fungible. - Yeah, very flexible. - One nice thing for us, given our current level of pricing disparity across like. customers like that issue that we have, is that that would give us, though it's a lot of work, that would give us a somewhat wholesale model change in the course of which we could address some of that contraption risk. So very early, but just on the radar screen. Great. Any other areas that we haven't talked about that we should have on our mind? in terms of support or G&A? - Enablement and documentation. We're gonna need a trainer and we're gonna need somebody to do a bunch of doc writing. - Is this, where would this, can you, would this be raw? Is this for support or is this including? across SEs? I mean, I'm thinking everything. Everything. Yeah. No, I mean, ultimately the sales enablement, I don't know how it's done today in Rust, to be honest. But I mean, we would just have to follow suit, and we are already working on with product marketing on the sort of to the field for each one of the hyperscalers and messaging we are having like two different strategies one is for the end customer and one another one there's a huge opportunity that me and Jason are working on is actually the cell to strategy of these larger environments that span across the Neo cloud and into the hyperscalers themselves and they and the hyperscalers themselves are actually using this maturely for their own solutions and that needs to be a little bit different strategy so the sales enablement and those who are actually working on those deals have to be you know this has to be completely different collaterals

[00:41:40.03]  Jason ValleryI think an important point on that, just so we're all aware of the business opportunity, is that today, Microsoft is, I mean, I'm coming with a Microsoft lens here, but I imagine this is happening in others, Microsoft is selfish with their GPUs. The third-party GPU business is almost non-existent, because when they get new capacity that comes online, it either goes to OpenAI or it goes to Microsoft. Microsoft as itself, Microsoft one customer, they actually don't have any capacity to go sell to 3P Azure customers yet, and so we are at least in a state right now where we can get ourselves to a mature platform before that business really starts kicking in. Because inevitably once supply and demand equalize, that business will pick up and we'll be ready to go. So, that's why the cell two is primarily the motion today.

[00:42:27.42]   Remote>> Got it. >> Yep. >> That's helpful. Okay, so maybe we'll circle back and just check that we have the appropriate capacity and enablement and documentation. Good points. Great. Excellent. Well, if there's no other questions or points, I think this has been really helpful. We've got some actions coming out of it and yeah, I appreciate the time. - Stuff. - Thank you. - Thank you, bye-bye, have a good day. Bye-bye.
