# VAST on Cloud positioning, intake process, and near-term roadmap constraints (VM shapes, marketplace automation, object storage integration)

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Project**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Lior Genzel, Tiffany Stonehill, Olivia, Jason Vallery, Paul, Arik Kishner, Director Hampson, Beth, Madhu

## Summary

Internal VAST team aligned on how to position VAST on Cloud around the global namespace, specifically moving data to where compute runs across on-prem, public cloud, cross-cloud, and Neo clouds. The team reviewed current constraints from cloud VM shapes and cost, agreed to route field opportunities through a dedicated Slack channel plus Salesforce, and identified follow-ups on tenant-level peering and object storage integration to improve multi-PB economics.


## Action Items


- [?] Add Jason Vallery to the VAST on Cloud Slack channel so he can engage on field opportunities and support requests. @Tiffany Stonehill 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Finalize and distribute VAST on Cloud positioning assets (battle cards, talk tracks, and related collateral) to the field once approved. @TBD 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Route VAST on Cloud opportunities by posting details in the dedicated Slack channel and registering the opportunity in Salesforce for tracking and support. @TBD 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Use the dedicated VAST on Cloud Slack channel as the primary intake path for field opportunities, with opportunities also registered in Salesforce for tracking and rapid support.

- Position VAST on Cloud primarily around VAST's global namespace and the ability to move data to where compute runs across on-prem, public cloud, cross-cloud, and Neo clouds.




## Key Information


- Tiffany Stonehill covers AWS and Microsoft Azure for VAST on Cloud field engagement.

- Olivia covers Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) for VAST on Cloud field engagement.

- Jason Vallery joined VAST Data as VP of Product Management for Cloud and reports to Jeff Denworth.

- Jason Vallery previously led product management for Microsoft's object storage platform for 13 years.

- VAST's global namespace is positioned as the key differentiator for VAST on Cloud, enabling customers to place data where compute runs across on-prem, public cloud, cross-cloud, and Neo clouds.

- A field example discussed: ICE (New York Stock Exchange) evaluated bursting from on-prem to AWS but selected VAST on-prem after analyzing pricing and complexity, and the team still considered this a VAST win because cloud capability opened the conversation.

- VAST on Cloud positioning assets (battle cards, talk tracks, and related collateral) are being developed with Product Marketing and will be distributed to sellers when finalized.

- Paul is a newer VAST employee (approximately month four) and raised a customer scenario about moving workloads off GCP back to an on-prem data center, potentially using VAST on Cloud for hybrid or migration use cases.
