# Ownership and accountability for Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local support opportunities

**Date**: 2025-12-01

**Project**: [[Cloud]]

**Attendees**: Karl Vietmeier, Myself

## Summary

Karl Vietmeier flagged growing inbound interest in whether VAST supports Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Microsoft Azure Local. He noted that these start as cloud opportunities but shift to on-prem ownership once hardware is involved, creating accountability confusion and reducing visibility into progress. Karl asked Jason Vallery for guidance on how strongly Cloud Product Management should assert ownership and control for these opportunities.


## Action Items


- [?] Provide guidance to Karl Vietmeier on how aggressively Cloud Product Management should assert ownership and how much control Jason Vallery wants to maintain over Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Microsoft Azure Local opportunities. @Myself 📅 2025-12-03 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Karl Vietmeier is a Cloud Solutions Architect for VAST on Cloud at VAST Data.

- VAST Data is seeing growing interest from the market in whether VAST supports Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Microsoft Azure Local.

- For Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Microsoft Azure Local opportunities, ownership often shifts from cloud teams to on-prem teams once hardware is involved, which creates confusion over accountability and reduces visibility into progress and outcomes.

- Karl Vietmeier believes Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Microsoft Azure Local opportunities should be managed through Cloud Product Management because Cloud PM has the strongest hyperscaler relationships and these solutions are expected to be acquired through hyperscalers and tied to cloud consumption.
