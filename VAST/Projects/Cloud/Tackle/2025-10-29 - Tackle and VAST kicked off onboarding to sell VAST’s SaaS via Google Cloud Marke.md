# 20251029 0759 Parallels Transcription

**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Participants:** Dave Stryker, Peter Kapsashi, Ikki, Jonsi Stefansson, Jason Vallery, A.K. Rapsone, Huckney, Pali, Jotam

## Summary

Tackle and VAST kicked off onboarding to sell VAST’s SaaS via Google Cloud Marketplace using Tackle as middleware. Priority is GCP first by reusing the existing private-offer-only listing, connecting Tackle via service account and IAM roles, and enabling reporting. Discussion focused on pricing structure (fixed-price private offers plus overage), metering options (including a penny-based meter), multiple meters, subscription event notifications from Marketplace to VAST’s Polaris control plane, SSO approach, and ensuring metadata flows to Salesforce so fixed contract $ amounts map to capacity (e.g., TB). Legal may refresh the EULA. PK will populate listing content and handle technical integration after access is granted.

## Key facts learned

- Start with Google Cloud Marketplace; VAST already has a live private-offer listing.
- Do not create a new GCP project; reuse existing project and product number.
- Tackle requires a GCP service account JSON key and specific IAM roles to list and meter on VAST’s behalf.
- Producer Portal and Google Payments are already set up; Tackle reporting export must be enabled.
- Initial sales motion: private offers per deal (fixed price), with desire to support overage charging when usage exceeds contracted capacity.
- Tackle supports overage metering and per-offer discounts; a penny-based meter can simplify variable pricing.
- Multiple meters are supported (e.g., TB, seats, CPU), but Google prefers clear unit labels.
- Google displays fixed prices as monthly equivalents; private offers can control payment cadence (e.g., upfront or monthly).
- Polaris needs subscription/fulfillment event notifications and entitlement metadata to gate expansion and track usage.
- Salesforce metadata linkage is needed so fixed contract values map to capacity/entitlements.

## Outcomes

- Agreement to proceed with GCP onboarding via Tackle and reuse the existing listing.
- PK will pre-populate listing content and manage technical integration once access is provided.
- All attendees to be invited to the Tackle platform.
- Alignment to explore fixed-price contracts with overage metering; internal VAST policy and finance handling to be defined.

## Decisions

- Start with Google Cloud Marketplace first; public offers may follow later.
- Reuse the existing GCP listing and project; do not create a new project.
- Initial motion via private offers; Tackle to handle technical integration and listing content population.

## Risks

- Unclear internal policy on overage charging vs. forcing new private offers may delay pricing setup.
- Metadata linkage from fixed-price private offers to capacity (e.g., TB) is unresolved, risking fulfillment and reporting gaps.
- SSO, subscription event delivery, and entitlement flows to Polaris are not yet defined, risking integration delays.
- Broad IAM roles required by Google may raise security/compliance concerns.
- Potential delays from legal EULA review and urgency to update the listing.

## Open questions

- Will VAST charge overages or require a new private offer when customers expand beyond entitlement?
- Which meters will be published (e.g., TB, seats, CPU) and will a penny-based meter be used?
- Will customers be allowed self-service expansion in Polaris or must sales approve expansions?
- What SSO approach will be used from Marketplace to Polaris for buyer access?
- How will subscription events and entitlement metadata be delivered to Polaris?
- What exact metadata will be synced to Salesforce to map fixed contract dollars to capacity entitlements?

[00:00:00.04]   Remote(fire crackling) (scissors snipping) Yeah, it was, it was this or one of a variety of Buffalo related sports hats and I was like, I feel like this is not that.

[00:01:30.02]  Jason ValleryTime, so. Hey Jason, how are you doing? Good, how about yourself? Doing well man. Nice to meet you.

[00:01:52.53]   RemoteHey, Icky. All right, I'm just forwarding the invite to Jonsi, I think he was joining. All right, I'll be right back. I don't know, he sounded pretty close to death with his cold, so I'm not sure he's going to join. I'll send them, I'll send them a link again just to see if you can listen in at least. Alright, we got Jotam hopping in. Awesome, uh, I think that we, I know we have who we need from the tackle side, Ikki, should we get started or are we waiting for anybody else? Yeah, let's get started. Okay, cool. We'll just do some quick intros first. I'm Dave Stryker. I'm the County Executive here at Tackle. I've been working with Lior and Ikki and the team over the last few weeks as we've kind of entered into our first phase of. partnership here. I'm so excited to meet you all. I want to introduce you to PK, who I'll let introduce himself and then we'll kind of go into some quick intros on the vast side. Yeah, hi everybody. My name is Peter Kapsashi. Everybody calls me PK at this point. I changed my name in Slack in my first month here and it stuck for the last four years. Anyways, my role here is to help get you guys onboarded. across the various clouds you guys are ready to sell in the cloud marketplaces. My background is pretty much in the cloud marketplace space. I worked at AWS Marketplace for seven and a half, almost eight years, and then moved to Tackle World about four and a half years ago now. I'm kind of the Mr. Fix-It, Mr. Everything guy over here at Tackle. I have my hands in a lot of spots, so I'm looking at multi-cloud deployments and making sure we got ourselves structured I like to do these ones, so bear it all in hand. - Great. - Cool, and then the VAST guys, if you don't mind, just doing a quick round of intros. - Yeah, hey everybody, I'm Jonsi Stefansson, I'm the GM of Cloud at VAST.

[00:04:30.33]  Jason ValleryHey guys, Jason Valerie. I just joined VAST about a week ago. I'm running product for VAST on the cloud side. I joined from Azure. I've been the last 13 years running product for Microsoft's object storage platform. I'm looking forward to working with you guys. A lot of familiarity with the Marketplace and cloud offers. I'll be focused on how we structure offers. offers and pricing and so forth for our cloud offers.

[00:04:56.68]   Remote- Awesome. - Yeah, A.K. Rapsone, you know me. I'm VP of Cloud Engineering, doing the integration stuff on the Cloud Marketplace Control Plan side of things. - O9 New York, we're setting guys, you know me. I'm Huckney, I just joined about a month ago. I'm on Egi's team and principal engineer there, so I'll be doing some of the actual integration with the endpoints and so on. Yeah, same with me, Pali, working with Egi, doing two years. Awesome. - Cool, thank you guys so much for that intro. This is going to be pretty much run by PK, but just to make sure that everybody's on the same page here of kind of like where Tackle comes in, why Vast has chosen to invest, where our key priorities are, and if any of this needs to be right-sized or course-corrected, hesitate to do so. But we are here today to kick off the onboarding experience of connecting the vast product to Tackle. For those of you who may not be super familiar with us, Tackle acts as a software company that has middleware that connects your product to the marketplaces. Through our pre-sales experience, we talked a lot about what the future state and multi-cloud nature of VASP cloud-based products will look and feel like. The Tackle platform, you know, allows VASP to essentially quickly list SAS listings across all hyperscale marketplaces, not needing to do any sort of integration work. Our platform does that as a service. We've talked about automating things like deployment and metering over the course of time, that would be a follow kind of where we start. Our priority is really starting with Google, and I know there's some listing time urgencies. We want to make sure that we capture that. But VR has been super helpful with kind of framing what we're trying to accomplish with these marketplaces. The first step, looking really about cross-selling the cloud portfolio into your existing customers that are currently consuming the on-prem version of your software, and then growing over time to kind of include new logo as the product develops and grows into more of a cloud-native product that kind of can be sold to new logos as a standalone. So I think we have a pretty good idea of where we want to start. start, how we can iterate and grow over time. So what PK is going to walk you through here is the overall onboarding experience and plan, and kind of where we should be looking, setting up what access looks like and what we need from your team to be able to get started, and then obviously showing you where you would actually drop in content to build listings and how our interaction will go. Any questions before I turn it over to PK? - What do you mean about the deployment part? - Deployment in terms of the listings or in terms of? - Oh, you said deployment. So I was just asking what do you mean in... in terms of deployment? - Yeah, it's like how your customer would get access to your product. So the Tackle platform has a number of different ways that we can do this. In its most, I guess, elementary state, a buyer accepts a private offer on the marketplace, we send you an order notification, and then you guys can fulfill that order. that process can also be automated as well. I mean, that's part of our work. So maybe I can, just to set the stage as well from an integration perspective, like what we are expecting. So we have a published marketplace offering now in GCP. GCP is the first target. we want to modify that so that we can use it with taco. What we are-- the next steps from that when we've set up the proper offering with the right pricing and setup that we talked about, like the fixed price and overage things about, the next step is for our platform, which we call Polaris, it's our control plane, to get notifications of subscription events, like whether it's a private offer has been fulfilled, like that somehow needs to reach us, and so I want to talk about that. I want to understand, and that could be a follow-up also with UPK, but I also want to understand how customers usually would go from the marketplace over to the SaaS, like if we're using the built-in single sign-on, for example, of the marketplaces to do that. But the last thing that is very important also is what metadata is going back and forth with the Salesforce side of things, and that ends up also being shared with us, because I think we talked about it a few weeks ago, that one of the issues with just using the marketplaces as is. is that we'll have to go with that fixed price but technically we have no idea what was sold because it's a dollar amount and it has a payment term but we on the control plane side have no idea if that's 100 terabytes or you know or petabytes it's just a dollar. amount. So, I want to understand how we get that information and how the flow actually works from private offer creation all the way to us getting the subscription notification with the metadata that's needed. Yeah, that's it. That makes sense, yeah. There's a whole bunch of moving pieces in there, but that's a good thing. We're asking good questions, like, just first and foremost, like, if you have a listing and you're like, "We gotta figure it out better," great. That's what we're here to do. That's what I do. The fun ones for me is kind of, all right, you've gotten across the starting line, and now it's like, how do we start running, not just kind of walking? Great. Yeah, I think we can cover a lot of that stuff, and if there's stuff we don't hit today, happy to have. You know, continuing conversations, either via email or pop it on calls, whatever works best for your teams. I know we've got quite a few times on sticking around, so it may not always be the easiest to get on a call, but happy to try to be as flexible as I can to make sure we can get stuff addressed. So typically speaking from here, this is normally when I ask where are we starting CloudWise, but I know we're starting with GCP. which is great. So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to share my screen, we're going to talk through kind of getting Tackle connected, what that looks like, what that means. We'll also take a peek at your existing listing, so we can take just a couple of questions around kind of what we want to do with that, and then we can start talking about data that gets passed over, structuring your pricing, packaging, and stuff, and we'll kind of see where we're at at the end of that time. Does that work for everybody? - Great. At any rate, as I start talking and rambling on and on, cut me off if you have questions. This is your time. It's much more important that we get to your questions than I knock through every single little kind of possible thing we can do. We can always add documentation and have things in writing later. So I'm going to share my screen and we'll just get rolling here through the platform. So, for those of you who haven't seen this yet, this tech platform, this is where kind of you guys will kind of use us as a hub for just working through your marketplace experience. So we have the ability to work through your listings from our listings tab. The stuff we need to focus on today is going to be two ones down here, first of which is going to be user management. So we need to know who from your team will need access to the platform for now, and then we'll work through integrations, which is really talking about tying your existing GCP project into Tackle, so we have access to it, so we can help list on your behalf, as well as meter on your behalf, and all of that stuff. User management, it is as straightforward as you can possibly imagine. At the moment, the only person in your space is me, since I've assumed my role. But effectively, we have two different roles within Tackle. that we'll want to talk about, which is really just what's called an administrator versus a user. A user means you can't invite anybody else to tackle. Administrators can't. So typically what I recommend is we add a couple of folks up top early on in the process to make sure that they have access, and that's usually going to be someone with pretty high-level access to the cloud we want to work through. So that way they can copy and paste any data over from-- cloud in question, as well as make sure they establish our roles in our next section, and then someone who will eventually be a little bit more responsible for things like day-to-day operations, so private offer creation, things like that. We start out with them and then have those two folks make the choices around who's going to get access to what, and from there, we can also talk about in the future if you need more of a role-based access. So if you have folks who will they only need access to reporting information or something like that, we can also put those in place as well. Do we happen to know kind of off the top of your heads who you guys want to have access to kind of a starting point? - Yeah. - The end of the call. - Yeah, the folks on the call, for sure. - All right, cool. At the end of the call, I'll make sure to just send out some invites. All right, so what we care about today the most is going to be this integration step. Effectively, this is the location where all of the steps to integrate, tackle to your seller accounts across the various clouds live. Please note, you can go ahead and hop into these and do these as you are ready. So if you have an AWS Marketplace seller account already, and that's something we're going to do in the future, you guys can do that. that. Google today because that's where we're at. So effectively, because you guys are already a seller, don't worry about the before you begin section, you guys already have this in place as my other tab shows, you have a live listing so we're good there, and so this basically walks through the things that we need to kind of get set up. The thing I will call it here is we say creating a project. Please do not create a new project. You guys have one, but now I don't want to have you guys do a new solution validation form with Google, and so you absolutely have to. I would much rather because your product also already has set up to only go through private offer. We can change what plan is out there or create a new plan to sell through private offer, so please don't make a new one. We would just need you guys to kind of drop in your project name and the product number in here for that step. So don't worry about that part. Next two sections are really going to be about one is getting a service account in place. If you have that already, great. Otherwise, we need to get access to that JSON key, and you can upload it via our platform. This is just getting the access that Google requires us to have. Same Same thing with tackle here, is basically going in the IAM section. adding these roles, we are begging, begging, begging, begging Google to give us a little bit of a smaller and more specific set of stuff than this. But until they provide one that works, because we've tried it several ways, we need these roles in place. This, will probably not need to do because already. have a list in this live that you should be able to just click this box because you guys also already have access to producer portal since you're selling so it's really just of these two parts it's really just copy and pasting JSON key permissions for a cloud admin contact this is more for us just this way if something does break Google changes a rule something happens we have someone we can reach out to, and finally, because you guys have already done this again, you have Google Payments set up because you're already selling, so you can just click the box. Reporting-wise, this is the one that we will need you guys to set up. If you don't do it, it's not the end of the world. I can kind of help with some of that if we need to. But effectively, this should have reporting pulled up correctly so that down the line, when we are fully running, we've know, a couple of deals run in a week, etc, etc. That's always the dream, right? Lots of deals. We can tackle so you guys can actually see that through our platform instead of having to go to just the download your CSV spreadsheet and hope that it's human readable, and that's kind of it from a setup side, because you guys have done so many moving pieces, my guess is this would take 20 minutes total. right access. It'll be easy, yeah, super easy to do. So it's pretty straight forward. This is the biggest kind of, quite frankly, because you guys already listened to me, this is going to be the thing that probably takes the most time, is just getting this portion in place, because just got to make sure we get the things right. It's not hard, just specific. So once we have that access, we can kind of do things. That said, I just talked bunch. Are there any questions about this? Does this make sense? Nothing scary or eye-opening here for y'all? No, it makes sense. Awesome. Cool. Then we can dive into the listing section of stuff here. Effectively, I took a look at your listing today. This stuff makes sense to me, especially if we're going to try to reuse this listing and just kind of change what I call the We take care of the integration for you guys. We also look at what those private plans look like. I wouldn't touch this stuff unless you have things you want to change, which we can absolutely do. So if there's things like wanting to change your product overview, adding additional identifiers, adding additional support information, white papers, et cetera, we can totally do all that at once. It's kind of up to how your team feels about it. But because those changes don't really require a huge amount of validation from Google, those are pretty low-hanging fruit. To me, the two things we want to make sure we get right in our first kind of review of things is, one, once we have access and you are ready for it, we will take over your technical integration. That's super easy. I take care of that on my end, and two, making sure we build out the correct kind of pricing and plan information, so that into a space where, you know, we're doing private offers, we want to make sure, you know, they have what you need, be that plans with metering, plans without metering, all that kind of stuff. Does that make sense? Yeah, and I think we'll probably need to update this somewhat, but, you know, say, I'm not sure who, like I know legal probably needs to just. a quick look at if the end-user license agreement is still valid because this was created in like almost two years ago or a year ago yeah and but other than that yeah I think probably the questions will be around how we need to structure the pricing and that. plan in the background. Cool. So what will happen for the record is I will fill in the majority of this for you guys based on the existing list once we have access just because there's no reason for you guys to copy and paste. I'm like, I know exactly what I'm looking for. I can do it without really thinking about it. I'd love to save you some time. But the things we need to think about are going to be plans and metrics, and you guys know what they're called. since you've built one before. But for example today, what do you guys have kind of built in the background today? So as you're packaging today, are you packaging just a pure contract? There's no metered portion, or is it all metering? Is it a mix of both? 'Cause those are kind of usually the starting point. - I think I'll let Leo, you know, say Jason. like a comment here because there's some unclear, a little bit of an unclear, how we set it up on

[00:20:48.63]  Jason ValleryGoogle specifically. I think there's also multiple time horizons, like what we're going to do immediately for private offers versus our roadmap and what we want done when we go to public offer - Yes.

[00:21:00.92]   RemoteMaybe what we just talked about yesterday, Jason, like it's the wish here that we have a fixed price, like every single private offer will be a different amount because it's different size deals. But don't we want, don't we want? to have like an overage price that we can somehow we can somehow charge.

[00:21:29.13]  Jason ValleryI don't know if Leo was on because I think he's best connected to the current deals that are in flight and you know I think during the private offer phase each deal will be negotiated directly with the customer and then it'll turn into a private offer so this is more of a question of what it will look like. a little later. So, I don't know, Lior, do you have any thoughts if you're on?

[00:21:50.39]   RemoteI'm talking about the, you know, let's say a customer buys 100 terabytes and then for some reason, before they can, you know, we can give them another 100 terabytes, you know, private offer, they need to expand their cluster into 150 terabytes. So how do we charge them for those 50 extra? That's the thing I'm asking about here. What controls do we have on that?

[00:22:26.85]  Jason ValleryWill that be a self-service capability in the platform that they can go in and expand the cluster without contacting anyone? us or do we need to be in the loop and turn that into...

[00:22:35.48]   RemoteYeah, so the platform can definitely handle that because we tell the user if they can expand or not based on the entitlement, but we were kind of discussing this, I think yesterday, that maybe overage should be at least price, so it's a little... a bit painful for them and they will want to talk to our, you know, account manager and get an updated contract, get a new private offer or a private offer attendant.

[00:23:06.71]  Jason ValleryWell, we, I mean, I don't know the exact mechanics behind this, but we have the ability to actually follow through and invoice that as an overage. or do we have to go through?

[00:23:17.52]   Remote- That's kind of what is, I think, what PK is. - That's what I was setting up as we were talking. I was like, "All right, I know, there's no problem." - So tell us what the options are. - Yeah, this is my world. This is the fun stuff. I always like trying to, all right, how do we put the jigsaw together? So effectively, what you guys are talking about right now is someone. in with a fixed price, and for those of you who aren't super familiar with Google, let me refresh my preview real quick. Google basically takes your price and it's going to break it down as they display it to a monthly cost, even though we said it's $12 for the year, and on a private offer, you get to determine when those payments come. So it could be all up front, it could be once a month, et cetera. But effectively, what we set up here is you've got your $1 month or $12 annual cost, and then basically, what we can set up is what's called an overage amount, and so in this case, I just put it at 10 bucks. Again, all numbers are silly and examples just go with round numbers for the sake of it. But effectively, this is now what if you're listening to set up this way, you can charge that customer an extra $10 per terabyte, they go over what they're contracted to. So if they're going from one terabyte, byte to two, you send in a metering charge. Now that customer is going to get an additional $10 charge on their next bill from Google, basically billing them for that usage. As you package things up, the things I try to tell folks, particularly on private offers is one, you can discount that amount when you do a private offer. So let's say it sticks at $10 and you've got a customer who you, who knows they're going to use a bunch, but it's going to month to month, they may set it up. So you, Hey, you know what? We're going to charge you a dollar per terabyte you go over. So that let's say if the seasonal business, November, December, there's something great. We're getting over a hundred extra terabytes over. They only get up, you know, they get a smaller charge. Whereas if they'd stayed at that public price, they'd have gotten $10 charge, but effectively we can set this up to kind of be as flexible as you want us to. that I kind of advocate for to save you guys a headache, if I'm totally honest, is I actually advocate for doing a penny as my overcharge, because then at that point, you can charge the exact amount you want, and you never have to worry about discounting things with the private offer itself. So if a customer comes in, and it's like, hey, we want this to be painful because you guys don't have a deal with us around this, you can charge them that 100% cost at a penny charge. So if you're, you know, charging somebody hundred dollars you're going to submit more units of that one unit equals one penny or if you have somebody who's got a great deal with you guys and you're only charging them a penny well one unit equals one penny and you're still charging them the same thing and your system and your team doesn't have to determine anything else outside of how many units you're going to charge them for that usage but again if you guys wanted to package it up differently no problem and you can use a discount on that metered cost per private offer, no problem. 'Cause I think that's really what you guys are talking about is making sure you have the ability to charge them on overages.

[00:26:04.16]  Jason Vallery- So I think it makes sense from a platform perspective. I think the question back to us is how we want to manage that with an internal finance and accounting and what that would translate to in terms of the deal structure of the end customer, negotiated one-off. So I think that's an interim question we have to take back.

[00:26:19.87]   Remote- Yeah, I always-- - And also like part of that conversation too, is like, what do you want the desired outcome to be? Like in some of our contracts, we quote unquote reserve the right to charge an overage. Like I have no intention of actually charging a customer an overage. Like my intention, if they use more tackle, them what they signed up for, I would want them to get into a new agreement, right? Like sign a new private offer. If you do want to be able, if you, I mean, if you do say, yeah, we're going to have overages and we're totally okay with charging overages until they get to their next renewal date or their next, you know, commercial event, uh, you know, this, you know, we have the flexibility, uh, to meter that, you know, in the beginning. manually like you can literally just plug in values and push those invoices right to Google. You can also upload a CSV and then eventually like we'll get to a place where this is automated and the metering API is connected to your product and the product would sense that they're over and they need to be charged a certain amount. So just know that as you guys formulate what you want that path to be like the crawl walk run nature of the way that this can evolve, like our platform will support however you want to do it.

[00:27:27.99]  Jason ValleryAnd just so we can multiple meters here, I mean, this example is just one meter, if we end up publishing more than one, we can dimension that, right?

[00:27:35.99]   RemoteOh, yeah, for sure. So if we if we needed to have one be as a terabyte, what is a data by one is, if you have a plan that you want it to be a number of people who have access to seats or users, those in as well. Say like, like CPU units or something? Yeah. Yeah, Google is going to be a little bit picky. They don't love things like units. So they just want to know what those are going to be charged as. So that's where things like features you can call it, hey, these would constitute units just like, hey, this could be a unit, this could be there are ways to do it. So it's fine. Just They don't love that word for some reason, I don't know what it is. Yeah, I think it's because they don't want customers to be, you know, bringing out their calculators and doing a spreadsheet to figure out how much it's going to cost. Probably. But that is, yeah, that is what it is, but one question on this. So I think when we were talking to Google specifically about, like, the teams that will make, at least as I understand it, is that basically we're making a private offer that says for this first petabyte of data, this is the offer that you're going to get, and they would use that. They create their cluster. We charge them for that petabyte, no matter how much they're using. Basically, we're always charging them that. But we probably want to, for multiple reasons, to say, if you go over that, then each terabyte after the petabyte is charged at this level, right? So when we talked to Google about that, one of the things that they were scratching their heads was that they were basically saying that that the overage or the extra terabytes above and beyond the petabyte would be discounted at the same discount rate as the fixed price offer. were talking about if the offer is public versus private and not as in private. offers but in a private listing kind of way. So, am I understanding it correctly that these are completely independent, like can you have the fixed price and we somehow now know that that's a petabyte and then we can supplement that with overage usage as well from our platform. call and tackle. I think so. So I have to kind of put the pieces together. So apologies as I talk a lot to think through but I have to put it together. So effectively, you guys are talking about, let's just go with one package. So your package is basically great. We're gonna give you a private offer. It's for a petabyte of data. up front for that. We're going to say, let's just, well, screw it. I'll go, I'll go with for annual or not annual, quarterly payments. So.
