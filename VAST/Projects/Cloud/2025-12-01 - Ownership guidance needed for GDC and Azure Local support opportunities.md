# Ownership guidance needed for GDC and Azure Local support opportunities

**Date**: 2025-12-01

**Project**: [[Cloud]]

**Attendees**: Karl Vietmeier, Myself

## Summary

Karl Vietmeier flagged growing inbound interest in VAST support for Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local and noted confusion when on-prem teams take ownership once hardware is involved. He recommends cloud product management own these opportunities due to hyperscaler relationships and cloud-consumption alignment, and asked Jason Vallery how aggressively to assert ownership and how much control to maintain.


## Action Items


- [?] Provide guidance to Karl Vietmeier on whether cloud product management should own Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local opportunities and how aggressively to assert ownership versus on-prem teams when hardware is involved. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Karl Vietmeier is a Cloud Solutions Architect focused on VAST on Cloud at VAST Data.

- VAST Data is seeing growing interest from the field in whether VAST supports Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local.

- When GDC or Azure Local opportunities involve hardware, VAST on-prem teams tend to take ownership, which creates confusion over accountability and reduces visibility into progress and outcomes for cloud product management.

- Karl Vietmeier believes GDC and Azure Local opportunities should be managed through cloud product management because cloud PM has the strongest hyperscaler relationships and these solutions are expected to be acquired through hyperscalers and tied to cloud consumption.
