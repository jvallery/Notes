# Red flare escalation: Azure MAI 2EB deal risk, supply chain constraints, and January execution plan

**Date**: 2025-12-27
**Project**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Jeff Denworth, Jonsi Stefansson, Lior Genzel, Rick Scurfield, Renen Hallak, Jason Vallery, Aung (Unknown), Maneesh (Unknown), Scott G (Unknown), Andy Perlsteiner, Leo (Unknown)

## Summary

Jeff Denworth escalated that he has low confidence in closing a Q1 Microsoft MAI deal unless VAST accelerates commercial engagement and on-site execution in Redmond. Key blockers include global supply chain turmoil, lack of active commercial discussions, and CoreWeave testing not yet started in earnest. Jonsi Stefansson reported Microsoft contacts (Aung and Maneesh) expect an Azure Blob integration proposal from VAST and that Microsoft stakeholders are largely out of office until January 5, 2026.


## Action Items


- [?] Sync with Jonsi Stefansson to draft and deliver the VAST integration proposal with Azure Blob expected by Microsoft contacts Aung and Maneesh. @Myself 📅 2026-01-05 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Determine Microsoft MAI supply chain position and constraints (allocation, timelines, and procurement path) and report back to Jeff Denworth to guide deal strategy. @Jonsi Stefansson 📅 2026-01-06 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Plan for either Lior Genzel or Jonsi Stefansson to be physically in Redmond at the start of the new year to begin commercial conversations for Microsoft MAI. @TBD 📅 2026-01-06 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Set up an engineering workshop in Redmond in January 2026 with Microsoft stakeholders to cover Azure Blob integration and MAI requirements. @Jonsi Stefansson 📅 2026-01-10 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Initiate real supply chain and build conversations with Microsoft MAI stakeholders by the second week of January 2026, per Jeff Denworth's milestone plan. @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-16 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule Renen Hallak to be in Redmond in the third week of January 2026 to meet with 'Scott G' (unknown last name) to align philosophically on the first MAI tranche and scaling plan with VAST. @Renen Hallak 📅 2026-01-23 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Drive paperwork completion for the Microsoft MAI deal during the last week of January 2026, per Jeff Denworth's milestone plan. @TBD 📅 2026-01-30 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Propose and start a daily update cadence for the Microsoft MAI pursuit to address Jeff Denworth's concern about insufficient active communication. @Myself 📅 2026-01-06 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Jeff Denworth proposed shifting VAST execution mode to assume CoreWeave testing is largely cosmetic and to prioritize immediate commercial and supply chain actions to drive a January first order for Microsoft MAI.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated he is moving quickly to having no confidence in closing a Q1 deal with Microsoft MAI unless VAST becomes more aggressive and executes a January plan.

- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft MAI needs 2 exabytes (2EB) of storage capacity on the floor in 2025.

- Jeff Denworth stated global supply chain conditions are in turmoil and VAST likely cannot support the MAI deal natively via Arrow or Avnet supply chain channels.

- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft has a large hardware allocation across Azure but is also in a bad supply chain position.

- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft is considering HDDs for the first April delivery for MAI scale-up, and that HDD supply is also constrained.

- Jeff Denworth stated CoreWeave testing for the MAI-related effort has not started in earnest.

- Jeff Denworth stated VAST has not started commercial discussions with Microsoft about the MAI deal at the time of the email thread.

- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft needs to order hardware very early to ensure GPUs are utilized quickly, and therefore needs an early software decision because each software choice impacts the overall hardware purchase.

- Jeff Denworth asserted that VAST is the most efficient use of infrastructure for Microsoft MAI at scale.

- Jeff Denworth referenced that the first CoreWeave deal was supported by having Andy Perlsteiner and an unknown person named Leo working out of CoreWeave offices daily, which he said has netted $1.5B in bookings so far.

- Jonsi Stefansson stated he met with Microsoft contacts Aung and Maneesh, and they expect an integration proposal from VAST for Azure Blob.

- Jonsi Stefansson stated he and Jason Vallery planned to sync to produce the Azure Blob integration proposal for Microsoft.

- Jonsi Stefansson stated he emailed Microsoft contacts to understand Microsoft supply chain status and platform needs, but received out-of-office replies indicating they return on January 5, 2026.

- Jonsi Stefansson's signature lists two phone numbers: +3546987478 while in Iceland and +14079510436 while in the US.
