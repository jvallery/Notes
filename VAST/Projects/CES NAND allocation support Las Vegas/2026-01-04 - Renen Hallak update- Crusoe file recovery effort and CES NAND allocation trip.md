# Renen Hallak update: Crusoe file recovery effort and CES NAND allocation trip

**Date**: 2026-01-04

**Project**: [[CES NAND allocation support Las Vegas]]

**Attendees**: Renen Hallak

## Summary

Renen Hallak shared an internal update describing a two-week R&D effort to recover nearly 200,000 files on Crusoe's cluster by building an automated recovery system, meeting a customer deadline after multiple all-nighters. He also noted he will travel to Las Vegas for CES to help Operations secure NAND allocation amid flash shortages and highlighted improved cross-geo collaboration as a driver of innovation.






## Key Information


- Renen Hallak reported that for the prior two weeks, a significant portion of VAST Data R&D was redirected to build an auxiliary system to recover nearly 200,000 files on Crusoe's cluster, evolving from manual to semi-automatic to fully automatic recovery.

- Renen Hallak stated the Crusoe incident required recovering every piece of customer data and that VAST Data is committed to never losing a single bit of customer data and maintaining a perfect record.

- Renen Hallak said that after a crisis was averted the prior week, he planned to travel to Las Vegas during CES to help VAST Data Operations secure NAND allocation due to an industry shortage.

- Renen Hallak claimed VAST Data has grown to account for more than 10% of the data center NAND market and therefore needs strategic relationships with major flash vendors.

- Renen Hallak observed strengthened collaboration between VAST Data teams across geographies as the company hires more R&D outside Israel and more G&A in Israel, and he framed cross-cultural 'edge of chaos' dynamics as a source of innovation.
