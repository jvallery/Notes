# Apollo

## Overview

Microsoft initiative with unclear scope/boundaries and many stakeholders; tight timeline with data centers going live, creating execution risk and making it hard to define Jason’s role and success criteria.

## Status

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | blocked |
| **Owner** | Manish |

## Current Blockers

- ❌ Scope and boundaries unclear (what is inside/outside Apollo)
- ❌ Many stakeholders/decision gaps slowing progress
- ❌ Compressed timeline with data centers going live
- ❌ Scope and responsibilities unclear (what is in/out of Apollo)
- ❌ Stakeholder misalignment and many parties involved

## Next Steps

- [ ] Clarify Apollo scope, ownership, and success criteria (not committed in note)
- [ ] Clarify Apollo scope, responsibilities, and success criteria (in/out, allowed/not allowed, workload boundaries)
- [ ] Define concrete scope, ownership, and success criteria for Apollo
- [ ] Clarify PM ownership, decision authority, stakeholders, and funding model for Apollo
- [ ] Assess near-term storage options deployable into Apollo datacenters (build vs buy/partner)
- [ ] Confirm whether Apollo will formally pursue a clean-sheet storage approach and Azure Storage’s role
- [ ] Define Jason’s proposed Apollo role, ownership scope, and collaboration model
- [ ] Schedule deeper working session on Apollo architecture and Jason’s ownership areas
- [ ] Develop approach to build Microsoft storage advocacy channel with NVIDIA
- [ ] Draft Apollo strategy proposal for agentic memory/KVCache and GPU-adjacent caching, including NeoCloud partnership model

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Do not pursue an internal compensation/scope package at this time.
- ✅ Jason will not stay at Microsoft.
- ✅ Jason will choose between VAST and Crusoe by 2025-10-08 (leaning VAST pending de-risking).
- ✅ Do not pursue a Microsoft counteroffer given compensation constraints and unclear scope.
- ✅ Proceed toward a decision between VAST and Crusoe with intent to resign by Wednesday.
- ✅ Do not pursue a Microsoft counteroffer/retention package.
- ✅ Jason will choose between VAST and Crusoe by Wednesday and proceed with resignation if accepting an external offer.
- ✅ Proceed with a competitive-offer approach to evaluate a Microsoft retention path.
- ✅ Keep communication open this week and reassess after Jason’s offer arrives.
- ✅ Shared view that Apollo likely requires a clean-sheet storage approach to be competitive.

## Key Facts

- Crusoe deadline is 2025-10-08.
- Prospective VAST role: PM title reporting to Jeff Denworth and VAST CEO (referred to as Renan); owns PM for a cloud control plane via Red Stapler (founded by Jan C. Stefansson); dotted-line support to Microsoft sell-to/sell-with and OpenAI Project Stargate.
- VAST compensation includes commission as a percentage of sales to OpenAI/Azure; equity component described as modest; outcome could range from zero to many millions.
- Leaving Microsoft would forfeit roughly $800K already vested, reducing the net gap versus a $2M offer to about $1.1–$1.2M.
- Apollo scope/boundaries at Microsoft are unclear with many stakeholders and tight timelines as data centers go live.
- Path to partner at Microsoft remains undefined.
- Jason has a VAST offer with complex, highly variable compensation tied to OpenAI/Azure sales plus equity.
- Crusoe offer deadline is Wednesday; VAST has not set a decision deadline.
- Microsoft cannot approach Crusoe-level compensation; any change would be modest and potentially insulting.
- Apollo scope and responsibilities are unclear, making it hard to define a successful role or path to partner.
