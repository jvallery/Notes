# Apollo

## Status

## Overview

Microsoft initiative with unclear scope/boundaries and many stakeholders; tight timeline with data centers going live, creating execution risk and making it hard to define Jason’s role and success criteria.

## Key Facts

- Crusoe deadline is 2025-10-08.
- Prospective VAST role: PM title reporting to Jeff Denworth and VAST CEO (referred to as Renan); owns PM for a cloud control plane via Red Stapler (founded by Jan C. Stefansson); dotted-line support to Microsoft sell-to/sell-with and OpenAI Project Stargate.
- VAST compensation includes commission as a percentage of sales to OpenAI/Azure; equity component described as modest; outcome could range from zero to many millions.
- Leaving Microsoft would forfeit roughly $800K already vested, reducing the net gap versus a $2M offer to about $1.1–$1.2M.
- Apollo scope/boundaries at Microsoft are unclear with many stakeholders and tight timelines as data centers go live.
- Path to partner at Microsoft remains undefined.
- Jason has a VAST offer with complex, highly variable compensation tied to OpenAI/Azure sales plus equity.
- Crusoe offer deadline is Wednesday; VAST has not set a decision deadline.
- Microsoft cannot approach Crusoe-level compensation; any change would be modest and potentially insulting.
- Apollo scope and responsibilities are unclear, making it hard to define a successful role or path to partner.
