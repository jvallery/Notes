# Terraform Static VIP Reservation

## Status

## Overview

Provide Terraform examples/snippets showing how static VIP IPs are provisioned/reserved on GCP to ensure they remain allocated even when not attached to a VM interface.

## Open Tasks

## Recent Context

## Key Facts

- GCP IP reassignment requires remove then reassign, creating a short race window during failover.
- MIGs can use a pool of reserved static IPs for primary addresses; alias IP behavior differs.
- Alias IPs are expected to be unsupported with RDMA; RDMA uses a separate subnet/interface.
- Z4M will launch with inter-node RDMA; GPU-direct storage RDMA is a separate effort.
- Two interfaces (RDMA and TCP) are expected per Z4M instance; may be same VPC on different subnets.
- Cross-project RDMA will require Private Service Connect interfaces; VPC peering will not be supported.
- Route-based failover has latency/convergence considerations; ILB introduces pricing/feature tradeoffs.
- Per-VM bandwidth is capped; adding NICs does not increase aggregate bandwidth.
- Initial test scale target is roughly 10–30 instances; CI and scale testing will require more.
- Ben is the new Google PM counterpart for this effort.
