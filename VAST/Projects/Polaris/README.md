## Key Facts

- MVP launch on GCP uses private offers with fixed capacity pricing ($0.07/GB) via GCP Marketplace.
- Tackle.io is the middleware to generate private offers and sync them with Salesforce opportunities.
- Polaris is the source of truth for entitlements and metering; clusters call home to Polaris and enforce entitlements via tokens (no license keys).
- No BYOL for MVP; all transactions go through marketplaces to support hyperscaler partner status and MDF/marketing benefits.
- Considering ~10% overage allowance; goal is to charge overage at list PAYGO, but GCP Marketplace may not support this natively.
- Internal CS/sales alerting for entitlement usage/overage is not yet in place; customer alert exists.
- First GCP transactions targeted for Nov–Dec 2025; plan to replicate approach to AWS/Azure afterward.
- Finance will not have a separate cloud P&L; cloud metrics will be reported within overall P&L; SaaS/consumption metrics and forecasting model must be defined before full SaaS launch.
- GCP MVP will use routable IPs; customer must provide an IP range.
- GCP v1 performance observed: ~90% of theoretical read and ~50–60% of theoretical write; no standardized KPIs defined yet.
