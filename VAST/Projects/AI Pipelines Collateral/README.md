## Key Facts

- Jason’s mandate is to own multi-cloud strategy end-to-end and translate deal flow into requirements, Confluence docs, and focused cloud plays (Azure/AWS/GCP/Oracle plus Foundry/Bedrock/Vertex).
- Near-term proof points include building the 'dagger' Azure slide, establishing a win/loss cadence, and embedding with SEs during/after Tech Summit.
- Morty should remain focused on Neo while being onboarded to Jason’s team.
- Rob’s org is labeled Customer Success but operates more like reactive support; Rob is head of systems engineering and his team is primarily systems engineers.
- ByteDance example: bypassed Azure Storage by connecting their own datacenter to Azure via high-capacity WAN, illustrating China operational/technical constraints.
- Jeff uses Apple Calendar alongside Google Calendar for meeting management (tooling preference mentioned).
