## Overview

Internal proposals (Krishnan and team) around using a C-Store approach as part of caching strategy; needs evaluation against MAI requirements and other options.

## Recent Context

- 2025-09-03: [[2025-09-03 - Jai outlined a high-priority evaluation for an AI caching strategy to support MA]] - Weekly 1:1 where Jai Menon aligned with Jason Vallery on a high-priority evaluation of AI caching st... (via Jai Menon)

## Key Facts

- MAI scale targets: ~400k GPUs for training and ~40k GPUs for inference in ~2 years.
- Target data-plane scale for caching: ~100k nodes; environment focus: AKS + Spark.
- Potential requirement: multi-region, cross-WAN cache pooling (to confirm with MAI).
- Bifrost includes a direct read path bypassing FE/table for reads by caching location info and reading directly from capacity nodes.
- DeltaZero is positioned as a follow-on to Bifrost (positioning still in progress).
- Compute for MAI moved into Brendan’s AKS org; Qi ("Kiki") Ke (CVP) leads compute side; Yumin interfaces from storage side.
- Performance snapshot outcome appears to be 'Meets Expectations'; Jason is disappointed and plans to discuss with Ong and potentially Manish.
