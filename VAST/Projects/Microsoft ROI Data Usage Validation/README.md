## Key Decisions

- ✅ Set a monthly touchpoint with Brandon to align on cloud platform priorities.
- ✅ Customer requirement docs and FRDs will be authored and maintained in Confluence.
- ✅ Prioritize building a first-class cross-cloud platform and GTM versus ad hoc deal chasing.
- ✅ Carl to move to ProServe under Rob.
- ✅ FRDs and detailed customer requirements will be authored/maintained in Confluence.
- ✅ Jason will own multi-cloud strategy end-to-end and catalog in-flight opportunities from a product requirements lens.
- ✅ Establish a monthly touchpoint between Jason and Brandon.
- ✅ Carl will move to ProServe under Rob due to customer-facing risk.
- ✅ Morty will transition to the author’s team while maintaining Neo cloud feature ownership/commitments.

## Key Facts

- All listed Microsoft/Azure tasks were completed on 2025-11-08.
- Focus areas included minimizing Azure egress (ExpressRoute Direct Local), aligning Azure GA milestones with Lifter phases, and producing BizDev/ROI/marketplace collateral.
- John runs alliances/partnerships and is the go-to for AMD/NVIDIA and conventional channel partnerships (non-cloud).
- Sagi leads pipelines/serverless; packaging and cloud GTM for pipelines is under-thought.
- Morty owns Neo-cloud feature requirements; he can support Jason but must maintain Neo-cloud coverage.
- Rob’s 'Customer Success' org functions primarily as reactive support and systems engineering today.
- Confluence is the source of record for FRDs and customer requirement documentation for engineering consumption.
- Google RFP is likely TPU-oriented; ensure it is not block-I/O latency sensitive where NetApp excels.
- Jeff emphasizes a hands-on philosophy: direct field exposure and concrete customer problems over purely theoretical strategy.
- Jeff will be in Orlando Tuesday–Thursday next week for sales strategy; SE engagement at Tech Summit is high value.
