- John runs alliances/partnerships and is the go-to for AMD/NVIDIA and conventional channel partnerships (non-cloud).
- Sagi leads pipelines/serverless; packaging and cloud GTM for pipelines is under-thought.
- Morty owns Neo-cloud feature requirements; he can support Jason but must maintain Neo-cloud coverage.
- Rob’s 'Customer Success' org functions primarily as reactive support and systems engineering today.
- Confluence is the source of record for FRDs and customer requirement documentation for engineering consumption.
- Google RFP is likely TPU-oriented; ensure it is not block-I/O latency sensitive where NetApp excels.

- Jeff will be in Orlando Tuesday–Thursday next week for sales strategy; SE engagement at Tech Summit is high value.
