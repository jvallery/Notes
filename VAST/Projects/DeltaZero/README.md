## Key Facts

- MAI scale targets in ~2 years: ~400k GPUs for training (~100k nodes) and ~40k GPUs for inference.
- Primary environment for MAI is AKS/Kubernetes with Spark.
- Caching options under consideration include C-Store proposals (Krishnan’s team), Alluxio/DAX (supports inference/KB caching), OpenAI cache code (pending IP confirmation), and BlockFuse/BlobFuse approaches.
- OpenAI cache access appears permitted for Microsoft services but requires confirmation via Pete and SILA legal.
- Bifrost includes a direct read path from compute to capacity nodes, bypassing FE/table for reads; Lukasz is implementing this component.
- Compute for MAI moved under Brendan’s org (AKS); CVP Qiu Ke involved; Yumin coordinating.
- Possible MAI requirement: multi-region pooling for a distributed cache (unconfirmed).
- MAI target scale in ~2 years: ~400,000 GPUs for training (~100,000 nodes) and ~40,000 GPUs for inferencing.
- Primary environment for MAI: AKS/Kubernetes and Spark.
- Caching options considered: OpenAI cache, Blobfuse/Blockfuse, AC Store/C-Store, Alexio/DAX.
