## Key Facts

- All listed Microsoft/Azure tasks were completed on 2025-11-08.
- Focus areas included minimizing Azure egress (ExpressRoute Direct Local), aligning Azure GA milestones with Lifter phases, and producing BizDev/ROI/marketplace collateral.
- Jason Vallery has ~13 years on Azure and previously led Microsoft’s OpenAI engagement and large-scale storage programs; recently returned from sabbatical into an architect role under Manish.
- Azure Storage org is ~1,600+ people; Jason cited slow execution as a cultural challenge.
- VAST cloud GA plan discussed: GCP GA in October, AWS GA (MVP) in December, Azure GA in February, with broader Azure/Lifter milestone targeted next September.
- VAST signed Microsoft Lifter and is pursuing Azure marketplace, customer-tenant managed offering, and future 1P alignment.
- ExpressRoute Direct Local was identified as a key mechanism to mitigate egress costs via fixed-price high-bandwidth connectivity.
- GPU supply constraints limit 3P deals; demand remains high.
- Azure LSV4 is the only current option and has poor economics (too many cores, weak networking, low drive density).
- VAST density claim: ~1 EB needs ~20 VAST racks vs ~240 Blob racks; power can be ~1/5 in MAI Falcon-type clusters.
