## Key Facts

- John owns alliances/partnerships for conventional channels (incl. AMD/NVIDIA) and control-plane partner ecosystem for Tier-2 cloud-in-a-box.
- Morty owns Neo cloud feature requirements; moving to Jason’s team but must keep Neo focus.
- Customer Success under Rob is effectively reactive support, not proactive CS.
- SE org is critical to Jason’s success; Hari called out as a top SE.
- China posture agreed: software-only sales outpost; avoid CAPEX/headcount build-out.
- Need a crisp, quantified Azure Storage gaps narrative ('dagger' slide) and a repeatable measurement rubric across clouds.
- Win/loss analysis should be routine and tied to Sales Ops; cloud is a platform, product gaps apply across deployment environments.
- Confluence is the engineering-respected source of truth for FRDs/requirements; coordinate taxonomy with Alon (A.L.) and Tomer.
