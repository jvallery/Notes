## Key Facts

- Marketplace offers enable procurement/transactability, but VM economics can be non-competitive at scale; longer-term paths include deeper cloud primitives and potentially CSP data-center hardware.
- Tackle + Salesforce + Polaris integration is required for private offers, entitlement/metering, and operational reporting.
- Azure Marketplace SKU update/change request has near-term deadlines (tracked in weekly status updates).
- GA acceptance criteria include operational “spin up/spin down” behavior and clear support/DR expectations for an MVP.

- The Weekly VAST GTM Meeting agenda includes surfacing blockers to Azure Marketplace onboarding and later transactions, plus aligning promotional assets prior to launch.

- Jeff Denworth stated that the Azure Marketplace SKU change request for VAST is due on Friday (2026-01-09).

- The Weekly VAST GTM Meeting includes surfacing blockers to Azure Marketplace onboarding and later transactions, which aligns to Cloud Marketplace MVP execution.
## Topics

- Marketplace ops: private offers, entitlement/metering, reporting exports
- Offer packaging: user stories, GTM collateral, competitive comparisons
- Azure specifics: SKU changes, procurement constraints, marketplace limitations

- Azure Marketplace SKU change request process and deadline (due 2026-01-09)

- Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP deck update for VAST

- Microsoft MAI unified cache pricing follow-up
## Key Decisions

- Proceed with marketplace-based deployment and private offers to enable commit burn-down and smoother fulfillment once offers are GA/transactable.
