## Overview

Project to launch VAST via cloud marketplaces (GCP first, then Azure/AWS) with an MVP offer, operational process, and metering/billing integration.

## Open Tasks

```tasks
path includes VAST/Projects/Cloud Marketplace MVP/
not done
```

## Recent Context

- 2026-01-05: [[2026-01-05 - Weekly status- Azure Marketplace action items SKU change, GDC RFP deck, MAI unified cache pricing]]
- 2026-01-05: [[2026-01-05 - Cloud Marketplace MVP - GA acceptance criteria, GTM package, and competitive comparisons]]
- 2025-10-29: [[2025-10-29 - VAST on Cloud positioning and GTM alignment, MVP architecture, marketplace plan, and hyperscaler constraints]]

## Key Facts

- Marketplace offers enable procurement/transactability, but VM economics can be non-competitive at scale; longer-term paths include deeper cloud primitives and potentially CSP data-center hardware.
- Tackle + Salesforce + Polaris integration is required for private offers, entitlement/metering, and operational reporting.
- Azure Marketplace SKU update/change request has near-term deadlines (tracked in weekly status updates).
- GA acceptance criteria include operational “spin up/spin down” behavior and clear support/DR expectations for an MVP.

## Topics

- Marketplace ops: private offers, entitlement/metering, reporting exports
- Offer packaging: user stories, GTM collateral, competitive comparisons
- Azure specifics: SKU changes, procurement constraints, marketplace limitations

## Key Decisions

- Proceed with marketplace-based deployment and private offers to enable commit burn-down and smoother fulfillment once offers are GA/transactable.
