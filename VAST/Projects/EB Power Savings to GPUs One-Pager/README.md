# EB Power Savings to GPUs One-Pager

## Overview

## Status

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | complete |
| **Owner** | Jason Vallery |

## Current Blockers

_No known blockers._

## Next Steps

## Collaborators

| Person | Role | Company |
|--------|------|---------|
| [[Mustafa]] | MAI advocate/sponsor (power constrained) | Microsoft |
| [[Jason Vallery]] | Product management (cloud); partnerships with hyperscale cloud providers | VAST Data |

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Carl to move to ProServe under Rob.
- ✅ FRDs and detailed customer requirements will be authored/maintained in Confluence.
- ✅ Jason will own multi-cloud strategy end-to-end and catalog in-flight opportunities from a product requirements lens.
- ✅ Establish a monthly touchpoint between Jason and Brandon.
- ✅ Near-term focus on MAI and UK Met Office over broad sales motion.
- ✅ Pursue a dual-track: marketplace listing plus flagship customer escalations.
- ✅ Use Nidhi to re-energize internal advocacy once the story and offer are ready.
- ✅ Pursue a BizDev-led path (Joe Vane/Harish) to secure executive sponsorship (John Tinter) and engage Ronnie Booker’s org, rather than focusing on Nidhi/Manish.
- ✅ Treat the Azure Marketplace VM-based VAST offer as a checkbox while pushing a hardware/OEM storage-dense path for real density wins.

## Key Facts

- All listed Microsoft/Azure tasks were completed on 2025-11-08.
- Focus areas included minimizing Azure egress (ExpressRoute Direct Local), aligning Azure GA milestones with Lifter phases, and producing BizDev/ROI/marketplace collateral.
- John owns alliances/partnerships for conventional channels (incl. AMD/NVIDIA) and control-plane partner ecosystem for Tier-2 cloud-in-a-box.
- Morty owns Neo cloud feature requirements; moving to Jason’s team but must keep Neo focus.
- Customer Success under Rob is effectively reactive support, not proactive CS.
- SE org is critical to Jason’s success; Hari called out as a top SE.
- China posture agreed: software-only sales outpost; avoid CAPEX/headcount build-out.
- Need a crisp, quantified Azure Storage gaps narrative ('dagger' slide) and a repeatable measurement rubric across clouds.
- Win/loss analysis should be routine and tied to Sales Ops; cloud is a platform, product gaps apply across deployment environments.
- Confluence is the engineering-respected source of truth for FRDs/requirements; coordinate taxonomy with Alon (A.L.) and Tomer.

## Topics / Themes

Microsoft Azure networking and egress minimization, Azure GA milestones and Lifter program alignment, ROI data usage validation for comparisons, LSv4/LSv5 vs OEM/ODM vs Azure Storage positioning, Microsoft BizDev enablement and introductions, Power savings translated to GPU capacity, Marketplace L-series offer expansion (SKUs/OEM path), Org chart and key leaders across marketing, alliances, SE, sales, finance, Multi-cloud strategy mandate (Azure/AWS/GCP/Oracle) and complement vs compete framing, Cloud packaging and serverless/pipelines gaps, Neo cloud requirements ownership and team transition, Customer Success vs support operating model, SE engagement strategy and Tech Summit embedding, China go-to-market posture (software-only), Azure Storage limitations and messaging for Microsoft
