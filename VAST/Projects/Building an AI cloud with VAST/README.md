# Building an AI cloud with VAST

## Overview

Planned 45-minute SCO session for Jason: explain why VAST is used, where it’s going, and how a NeoCloud can integrate VAST into a cloud services portfolio (multi-tenancy best practices, control plane direction, mapping VAST capabilities to AI lab/enterprise use cases).

## Status

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | active |
| **Owner** | Jason Vallery |

## Current Blockers

- ❌ Session agenda/content not fully built yet
- ❌ Need NeoCloud user stories and market framing to be crisp by February

## Next Steps

- [ ] Draft session narrative and agenda for SCO
- [ ] Coordinate with Morty/NeoCloud work to ensure accurate roadmap and examples
- [ ] Ensure content assumes mixed audience (not all already VAST storage users); audience is camera/YouTube

## Collaborators

| Person | Role | Company |
|--------|------|---------|
| [[Jeff Denworth]] |  |  |
| [[Jason Vallery]] | Product management (cloud); partnerships with hyperscale cloud providers | VAST Data |

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Do not prioritize building 'append blob' support speculatively for OpenAI; only consider if/when OpenAI asks or if pipelines will take years to move and VAST wants that data.
- ✅ Define Blob API MVP for Microsoft AI as AZCopy compatibility rather than full Blob API breadth.

## Key Facts

- OpenAI is reportedly replatforming away from Azure Blob API for some scenarios and building its own data movement solution (e.g., rclone).
- Microsoft’s deal with OpenAI reportedly grants Microsoft ownership/exclusive rights to code written by OpenAI until AGI is declared; Microsoft can reuse/reship that IP.
- AZCopy is open source and is a key data movement tool for Azure Blob; MAI uses it as a data movement engine.
- Bing uses an internal storage platform called Cosmos (not Cosmos DB) with its own API surface; attempts to migrate Bing to Blob reportedly failed.
- Azure premium blob is described as small (likely petabytes, not exabytes); Azure disks business is not the near-term winnable market for VAST.
- Flash supply constraints may persist due to vendor capacity shifting toward higher-margin HBM/DRAM; price of flash recently doubled (per discussion).
- Two distinct integration patterns: (1) offload/tiering in VAST-native format (performance/cost optimized but not readable via native cloud APIs), and (2) exposing existing cloud-native data requiring change notifications and eventual consistency (e.g., Azure Change Feed).
- VAST does not support Azure Key Vault integration today (gap for customer-managed keys).
- Private Link / VNet boundary is a recurring constraint for integrating VAST with Azure managed services; first-party services may have deeper access (e.g., network security perimeter).
- Jason is earmarked to present at SCO; Jeff wants him to be 'lord of all things cloud' and cover AI cloud building with VAST.

## Topics / Themes

Azure Blob API vs Tuscany trade-offs, OpenAI storage architecture and internal competition (Rockset/FoundationDB/RocksDB), AZCopy as Blob API MVP target, ABFS driver and Spark/Databricks integration considerations, Tiering/offload to Azure Blob and flash vs HDD supply dynamics, Namespace/metadata synchronization with existing cloud object data (change feed, eventual consistency), Azure Key Vault / customer-managed keys gap, Azure networking constraints (Private Link, first-party vs partner access), Foundry and Fabric integration opportunities, NeoCloud market shaping and packaging VAST portfolio, SCO session planning and messaging
