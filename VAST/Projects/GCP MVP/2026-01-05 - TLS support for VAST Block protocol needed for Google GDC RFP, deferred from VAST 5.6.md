# TLS support for VAST Block protocol needed for Google GDC RFP, deferred from VAST 5.6

**Date**: 2026-01-05

**Project**: [[GCP MVP]]

**Attendees**: Itzik Reich, Noa Cohen, Myself

## Summary

Itzik Reich asked Noa Cohen whether TLS support for VAST Block protocol would ship in VAST release 5.6 because it is a must-have requirement for a Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP. Noa confirmed TLS for Block was planned for 5.6 but was deferred due to higher-priority protocol features requested by more customers, and asked when Google requires it to consider a minor release after 5.6. Itzik requested that Jason Vallery engage Google once Maroun provides proposed test timing.


## Action Items


- [?] Engage Google stakeholders on the Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP to confirm required timing and expectations for TLS support on VAST Block protocol, after Maroun provides the proposed test timing. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide Noa Cohen with the Google GDC RFP required-by date for TLS support on VAST Block protocol so engineering can evaluate inclusion in a minor release after VAST 5.6. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Share suggested tests timing for Google GDC RFP validation (needed to trigger Jason Vallery outreach to Google on TLS for Block). @TBD #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Itzik Reich is assisting with a Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP and stated that Transport Layer Security (TLS) support for VAST Block protocol is a must-have requirement for that RFP.

- Noa Cohen stated that TLS support for VAST Block protocol was planned for VAST release 5.6 but was deferred due to other protocol features requested by more customers.

- Noa Cohen indicated VAST could consider adding TLS support for VAST Block protocol in a minor release after VAST 5.6 if it is confirmed as a must-have requirement, and asked when Google requires it.

- Itzik Reich asked Jason Vallery to engage Google about TLS for Block once Maroun provides the suggested test timing.
