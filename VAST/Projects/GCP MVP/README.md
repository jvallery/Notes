## Overview

Near-term Google Cloud marketplace MVP launch: private offers, fixed-capacity pricing, routable-IP deployment flow, demos/collateral, and GA readiness.

## Open Tasks

```tasks

```

## Recent Context

- 2026-01-05: [[2026-01-05 - Google- Confirm GCP GA timing after bottleneck fix and align lighthouse customers]]
- 2025-12-17: [[2025-12-17 - Google Slides share- GCP Flow from customer to sales to customer.pptx edit access]]
- 2025-10-28: [[2025-10-28 - GCP Marketplace MVP launch readiness, private offers via Tackle, fixed capacity pricing and Polaris entitlements]]

## Key Facts

- Private offers only (no BYOL); fixed capacity pricing discussed at ~$0.07/GB list for offers.
- Deployment uses routable IPs and requires a customer-provided IP range.
- GA timing depends on post-bottleneck fixes and alignment on first 2–3 lighthouse customers.
- Strong field collateral and an end-to-end demo video are requirements for external readiness (e.g., Supercomputing).
- TPU testing and benchmark methodology reviews can drive next-step engagement with Google stakeholders.

## Topics

- GA timing, lighthouse customers, and field enablement
- Private offers, pricing, and overage policy
- Deployment flow (routable IPs), demos, and collateral

## Key Decisions

- Transaction path is marketplace-based private offers (no BYOL) for the MVP.
