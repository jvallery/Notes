## Key Facts

- Private offers only (no BYOL); fixed capacity pricing discussed at ~$0.07/GB list for offers.
- Deployment uses routable IPs and requires a customer-provided IP range.
- GA timing depends on post-bottleneck fixes and alignment on first 2–3 lighthouse customers.
- Strong field collateral and an end-to-end demo video are requirements for external readiness (e.g., Supercomputing).
- TPU testing and benchmark methodology reviews can drive next-step engagement with Google stakeholders.

- The "Google RFP: Internal Sync" calendar event was updated to use Zoom conferencing (Zoom meeting ID 97840966503, passcode 557890).

- A deck titled "GCP Flow from customer to sales to customer" was shared, likely related to defining or documenting the GCP MVP customer and sales process flow.

- The Google GDC Storage RFP engagement is part of VAST Data's broader Google Cloud Platform (GCP) workstream and requires coordination on compliance, hardware, and partner certification.

- Jeff Denworth requested an updated deck for the Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP.

## Key Decisions

- Transaction path is marketplace-based private offers (no BYOL) for the MVP.

- Route Google Distributed Cloud RFP encryption and key management questions to Violet (last name unknown) as the subject matter expert.

- TLS support for the VAST Block protocol will not be included in VAST release 5.6 because it was deferred in favor of other protocol features requested by more customers.

- For the Google Distributed Cloud RFP response, VAST should position data-at-rest encryption as software-based (potentially FIPS certified) rather than relying on self-encrypting drive (SED) hardware.

- VAST TLS support for Block protocol will not be included in VAST release 5.6 because it was deferred in favor of other protocol features requested by more customers.
