## Key Facts

- Private offers only (no BYOL); fixed capacity pricing discussed at ~$0.07/GB list for offers.
- Deployment uses routable IPs and requires a customer-provided IP range.
- GA timing depends on post-bottleneck fixes and alignment on first 2–3 lighthouse customers.
- Strong field collateral and an end-to-end demo video are requirements for external readiness (e.g., Supercomputing).
- TPU testing and benchmark methodology reviews can drive next-step engagement with Google stakeholders.

- The "Google RFP: Internal Sync" calendar event was updated to use Zoom conferencing (Zoom meeting ID 97840966503, passcode 557890).
