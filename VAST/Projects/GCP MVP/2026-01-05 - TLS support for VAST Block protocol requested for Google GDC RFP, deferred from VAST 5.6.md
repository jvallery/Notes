# TLS support for VAST Block protocol requested for Google GDC RFP, deferred from VAST 5.6

**Date**: 2026-01-05

**Project**: [[GCP MVP]]

**Attendees**: Itzik Reich, Noa Cohen, Myself

## Summary

Itzik Reich asked Noa Cohen whether TLS support for VAST Block protocol is still planned for VAST release 5.6 because it is a must-have requirement for a Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP. Noa confirmed TLS for Block was planned for 5.6 but was deferred due to other protocol features requested by more customers, and asked when Google requires it to consider a minor release after 5.6. Itzik requested Jason Vallery to engage Google once Maroun provides proposed test timing.


## Action Items


- [?] Engage Google stakeholders on the Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP to align on TLS support for the VAST Block protocol once Maroun provides the proposed test timing. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide the required-by date from Google for TLS support for the VAST Block protocol so VAST can evaluate adding it in a minor release after VAST 5.6. @Itzik Reich ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Share the suggested test timing for Google validation of TLS support for the VAST Block protocol with Jason Vallery and relevant stakeholders. @TBD #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- TLS support for the VAST Block protocol will not be included in VAST release 5.6 because it was deferred in favor of other protocol features requested by more customers.
