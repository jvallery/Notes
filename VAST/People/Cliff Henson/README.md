## Recent Context

## Key Facts

- MAI contact requested to start testing immediately and prefers functional access now.
- Current support requires pre-certified hardware; VM support expected in December and only for small VMs.
- LSV4 is poor; future VM specs may be strong but are ~1 year out and uncertain versus competitors.
- Non-public Azure Blob HDD/Flash data should not be shared externally (e.g., with third parties).
- Microsoft org incentives are fragmented across storage/compute/networking; politics are sensitive.
- Azure hardware engagement likely requires sponsorship to reach CVP Ronnie Borker.
- Marketplace presence is viewed as important for credibility with some stakeholders.
- OpenAI is described as the top strategic win; reported right of first refusal lifted enabling multi-cloud data plane.
- Jason travel is heavy until mid-December; meeting Jeff in San Francisco next week for guidance.

## Background

Cliff Henson has over 24 years of experience in supply chain management. Prior to joining Microsoft in February 2020, he held various leadership roles at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, including Senior Vice President of Global Supply Chain. He holds a BSME from Texas Tech University and an MBA from the University of St. Thomas (TX).

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Do not include non-public Azure BLOB performance data in externally shared decks.
- ✅ Emphasize observability (single pane of glass) and CSI driver in the MAI deck.
- ✅ Pursue parallel strategy: marketplace SaaS maturity and first-party hardware-optimized wins.
- ✅ Near-term focus: Azure first-party opportunities (MAI, UK Met); OCI as secondary; AWS deprioritized for SC.
