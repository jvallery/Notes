## Key Facts

- Jason has been at Microsoft for 13 years.
- Jason previously received a large Microsoft stock grant after presenting an Amazon offer to Juergen; the 4-year vest completes soon.
- Jason has four external opportunities (two likely, two ruled out), including verbal commitments and an expected strong written offer after a CEO call.
- Jason’s decision timeline target was end of the week; he planned to share his best offer and explicit stay requirements.
- Jason prefers a management/leadership role with clear scope/ownership and latitude to execute; he is not interested in moving to another hyperscaler.
- Apollo storage: concern that datacenter buildouts require near-term storage now, while a clean-sheet stack could take 2–3 years; build vs buy/partner remains open.
- Jason Vallery moved from Microsoft Azure Storage to VAST Data to drive hyperscaler penetration and cloud product management.
- Kushal Datta is on Microsoft's Apollo team.
- Dallas HDD capacity is expected to land in January; a larger capacity build is expected in April; Richmond was replaced by a larger capacity site.
- Target per-site scale discussed: ~1 exabyte usable (potentially ~7 exabytes for a 350MW site) and ~120,000 GPUs.
