# Eyal Traitel

## Profile

**Role**: Program manager at VAST Data (Release planning)
**Location**: Tel Aviv
**Relationship**: Internal collaborator (release planning)

**Background**:
- Release planning perspective: minor releases caused churn; 5.6 GA around July; 5.5 missed cloud-critical items; auth providers limited (~8) and config not tenant-scoped.
- Referenced as a program manager to sync with.
- Joined VAST in Dec 2024; focuses on planning minor releases; works closely with release managers and with vForce/service pack teams; involved in planning discussions with control plane (Polaris/Iceland) and cluster teams for VAST on Cloud.

## Open Tasks

- [ ] Create unified backlog with RICE scoring and define Cloud Design Qualifiers required for 5.6; decide P0 vs P1 scope without slipping GA.
- [ ] Publish release discipline and support/EOL policy (freeze windows, gates, deal-override policy and RAPID table).
