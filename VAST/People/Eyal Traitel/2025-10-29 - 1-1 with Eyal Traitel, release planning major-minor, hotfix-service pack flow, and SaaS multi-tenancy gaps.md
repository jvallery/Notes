# 1:1 with Eyal Traitel, release planning (major/minor), hotfix/service pack flow, and SaaS multi-tenancy gaps

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**With**: Jason Vallery, Eyal Traitel

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Eyal Traitel aligned on how VAST plans and executes major and minor releases, including how urgent field requests, hotfixes, and service packs are handled. Eyal described intake channels (leadership, architects, and SE Salesforce requests), the phase-gate process run by Ops and R&D, and the roles of release managers and vForce in hotfix/service pack execution. They also discussed SaaS and multi-tenant readiness, with Eyal committing to share a Confluence multi-tenancy gap list and planning follow-ups including an in-person meeting during Jason's Tel Aviv visit (2025-11-23 to 2025-11-26).

## Key Information

- Eyal Traitel joined VAST Data in December 2024 and works in release planning; he expects to continue planning minor releases while Noa (a long-tenured VAST employee) manages major releases.

- VAST Data feature intake comes through leadership and architects (including requests influenced by NVIDIA discussions such as S3 RDMA), and through Sales Engineering requests filed in Salesforce tied to an opportunity and triaged by Tomer Hagay’s team with Jonathan Hayes, reviewed bi-weekly.

- VAST Data release planning is highly dynamic due to frequent urgent customer-driven requests (example given: Tesla), which causes scope churn between initial phase-gate commitments and final release content.

- For each VAST Data major release and minor release, a dedicated release manager (separate from Eyal Traitel and Noa) runs day-to-day execution with development and QA teams.

- VAST Data phase-gate release process is driven by operations and R&D process owners, specifically Shelly Martin (Ops) and Liraz (R&D), who drive documentation of release commitments.

- VAST Data uses a minor release process to address faster-turn requests, but urgent requests can still require out-of-band large hotfixes that may include feature work rather than defect fixes.

- Service packs and hotfixes at VAST Data are driven largely by vForce (Roy Sterman and team), acting as an R&D-facing arm in front of Customer Success and customers, including initiating backports from future releases for specific customers.

- Eyal Traitel joined VAST Data in December 2024 and works in release planning, focusing primarily on minor releases while Noa (veteran employee) focuses on major releases.

- VAST Data feature intake comes through leadership and architects (for example, NVIDIA-driven requests like S3 RDMA) and through Sales Engineering requests filed in Salesforce tied to opportunities, which are triaged by Tomer Hagay's team with Jonathan Hayes and reviewed bi-weekly.

- VAST Data uses release managers (separate from Eyal Traitel and Noa) to run day-to-day execution for major and minor releases across development and QA teams.

- VAST Data phase-gate release documentation and process are driven by Ops (Shelly Martin) and R&D (Liraz), and release scope often changes between phase gate 1 commitments and final GA content due to urgent requests and churn.

- Minor releases at VAST Data are treated like full releases, including regression and performance testing, with weekly content and testing reviews.

- Urgent customer-driven requests (example given: Tesla) frequently introduce new scope during a release cycle, forcing teams to reallocate effort from planned work and creating parallel workstreams.

- Large "hotfixes" sometimes include feature work to close deal or install gaps when the minor release cadence is not fast enough, creating an out-of-band delivery stream separate from the regular minor release cycle.

- Service packs and hotfixes are driven primarily by vForce (Roy Sterman and team), acting as an R&D-facing arm in front of Customer Success and customers, including initiating backports from future releases for specific customer needs.
