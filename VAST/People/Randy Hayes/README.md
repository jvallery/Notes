## Key Facts

- Google Distributed Cloud has connected and air-gapped variants; NetApp is the incumbent storage partner.
- Google issued a US-based RFP to replace NetApp for GDC storage; VAST was invited to respond and is undergoing vendor due diligence.
- Google’s emphasis areas include air-gapped support, compliance/attestations (e.g., DISA STIG), ops model (updates, staffing, troubleshooting), multi-tenancy, quotas, encryption, and tags.
- Fort Meade "Gemini as a service" on-prem initiative is described as a Q4 commit and a near-term joint validation path.
- GDC deployments commonly run on Dell; HPE and Cisco are also in scope for hardware options.
- VAST recently launched Google Marketplace offers; broader partnership is still early.
- Resource risk: Greg may be heavily focused on Leidos next year, potentially impacting continuity.
- John runs alliances/partnerships and is the go-to for AMD/NVIDIA and conventional channel partnerships (non-cloud).
- Sagi leads pipelines/serverless; packaging and cloud GTM for pipelines is under-thought.
- Morty owns Neo-cloud feature requirements; he can support Jason but must maintain Neo-cloud coverage.

## Background

Randy Hayes has been with VAST Data since its early stages, contributing to its growth from zero revenue to billion-dollar deals. He played a pivotal role in launching VAST Data Federal, a subsidiary focused on supporting government and defense organizations with data storage solutions. Prior to his current role, he served as Director of Sales at VAST Data.

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Greg Castellucci will run point with Google Federal and coordinate with the corporate GDC team over the next few weeks.
- ✅ Jason Vallery will coordinate RFP content assembly and connect Greg with Google stakeholders.
- ✅ Alon Horev will conduct a 1:1 with Muninder Singh Sambi focused on AI, VM shapes/RDMA, and hardware tradeoffs.
- ✅ Leo will own the end-to-end formal RFP response and submission.
- ✅ Use the Fort Meade on-prem Gemini initiative as the primary near-term validation path/reference.
- ✅ Include Dell and HPE SKU recommendations and consider Cisco/commodity VM options in the architecture proposal.
- ✅ Carl will move to ProServe under Rob rather than supporting customer-facing PM work.
- ✅ Set a monthly touchpoint with Brandon to align on cloud platform priorities.
- ✅ Customer requirement docs and FRDs will be authored and maintained in Confluence.
- ✅ Prioritize building a first-class cross-cloud platform and GTM versus ad hoc deal chasing.
