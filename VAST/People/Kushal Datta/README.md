## Key Facts

- MAI Falcon plan includes Phoenix, Dallas, and Richmond sites (~40k GPUs per site) connected by an AI WAN; initial tranche includes ~3 EB of Blob.
- MAI struggles to use Falcon capacity due to control plane fragility and GPU issues.
- OpenAI GPT-4.5 training reportedly took ~9 months across multi-islands and up to ~100k H100s; outcome described as disappointing, shifting away from ever-bigger clusters.
- MAI is exploring online RL continuous learning loops with ~60s feedback cycles (trainers in Phoenix, generators elsewhere).
- Vipin values VAST features (global namespace, quotas, capacity estimation, QoS) and acknowledges Blob cannot match VAST performance.
- Marketplace VM offers (Lsv4/v5) are not price-performance competitive for VAST at scale; hardware qualification is viewed as the long-term path.
- Azure Hardware qualification for first-party SKUs is a multi-year effort; liquid-cooled storage SKUs could help with data center cooling fungibility and late-binding storage vs GPU rack decisions.
- Blob API is largely Microsoft-specific; S3 compatibility is broadly attractive; multi-protocol (Blob + S3) could broaden appeal but faces Azure control plane integration hurdles.
- Andy’s team operates across four pillars: field escalation/POC support, lab management/benchmarks, SE enablement/training plus PM augmentation, and marketing support.
- Documentation is currently feature/button-oriented and not scenario-driven; scenario guides are ad hoc and late.

## Topics

Microsoft AI (MAI) org landscape and stakeholders, Falcon capacity rollout and AI WAN, MAI control plane fragility and GPU utilization constraints, Project Apollo (AKS-led slim control plane) and storage integration, Azure internal politics (Compute vs Storage incentives), Azure hardware qualification path and timelines, Liquid-cooled storage SKUs and data center cooling fungibility, Blob API vs S3 compatibility and multi-protocol strategy, Using MAI success as a wedge for broader Azure adoption, Roles and responsibilities between PM and Field CTO org, Documentation and field training ownership gaps, Release process: phase gates, implementation reviews, FRDs/Confluence, Hands-on enablement: OVA, SE Lab, GitLab access, VAST on Cloud viability and cloud economics, Multi-tenancy backlog toward SaaS

## Profile

**Role**: Apollo team member at Microsoft (Apollo team)
**Relationship**: Partner-side collaborator for MAI execution (Microsoft context)

**Background**:
- Referenced as a single-threaded owner candidate on MAI motion (with Vipin) for Microsoft-side execution planning.
- Key MAI stakeholder; owns the relationship between Microsoft AI and Azure.
- Mentioned in note summary as someone to build ties with (SEs/alliances) and in known projects list context (EB power savings one-pager) but not materially discussed in this transcript.

## Open Tasks

- [ ] Drive Microsoft MAI/Apollo 30/60/90 plan: align success criteria + test plan (30d), get POC live with measurable perf (60d), produce scale plan and Go/No-Go for 2–3 more sites (90d).

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Wait until Friday’s Kushal meeting before Alon follows up with Vipin.
- ✅ Prioritize Project Apollo as the first entry path over Azure marketplace SKUs.
- ✅ Use MAI success as the wedge to influence broader Azure storage strategy and hardware qualification.
- ✅ Treat Blob compatibility as exploratory; near-term emphasis remains on performance to keep GPUs utilized.
- ✅ Use Phil Wagstrom as primary multi-tenancy SME contact.
- ✅ Proceed with OVA and SE Lab access for Jason’s learning.
- ✅ Schedule a follow-up focused on OpenAI architecture and needs.
- ✅ Carl will move to ProServe under Rob rather than supporting customer-facing PM work.
- ✅ Set a monthly touchpoint with Brandon to align on cloud platform priorities.
- ✅ Customer requirement docs and FRDs will be authored and maintained in Confluence.
