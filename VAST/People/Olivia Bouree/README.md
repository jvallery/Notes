## Key Facts

- GCP IP reassignment requires remove then reassign, creating a short race window during failover.
- MIGs can use a pool of reserved static IPs for primary addresses; alias IP behavior differs.
- Alias IPs are expected to be unsupported with RDMA; RDMA uses a separate subnet/interface.
- Z4M will launch with inter-node RDMA; GPU-direct storage RDMA is a separate effort.
- Two interfaces (RDMA and TCP) are expected per Z4M instance; may be same VPC on different subnets.
- Cross-project RDMA will require Private Service Connect interfaces; VPC peering will not be supported.
- Route-based failover has latency/convergence considerations; ILB introduces pricing/feature tradeoffs.
- Per-VM bandwidth is capped; adding NICs does not increase aggregate bandwidth.
- Initial test scale target is roughly 10–30 instances; CI and scale testing will require more.
- Ben is the new Google PM counterpart for this effort.


- Google Distributed Cloud has connected and air-gapped variants; NetApp is the incumbent storage partner.
- Google issued a US-based RFP to replace NetApp for GDC storage; VAST was invited to respond and is undergoing vendor due diligence.
- Google’s emphasis areas include air-gapped support, compliance/attestations (e.g., DISA STIG), ops model (updates, staffing, troubleshooting), multi-tenancy, quotas, encryption, and tags.
- Fort Meade "Gemini as a service" on-prem initiative is described as a Q4 commit and a near-term joint validation path.
- GDC deployments commonly run on Dell; HPE and Cisco are also in scope for hardware options.
- VAST recently launched Google Marketplace offers; broader partnership is still early.
- Resource risk: Greg may be heavily focused on Leidos next year, potentially impacting continuity.
- John runs alliances/partnerships and is the go-to for AMD/NVIDIA and conventional channel partnerships (non-cloud).
- Sagi leads pipelines/serverless; packaging and cloud GTM for pipelines is under-thought.
- Morty owns Neo-cloud feature requirements; he can support Jason but must maintain Neo-cloud coverage.

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Create a shared pros/cons document to re-evaluate VIP/failover options (ILB, alias IP, route-based).
- ✅ Engage Google networking for a follow-up deep dive on RDMA and cross-project connectivity.
- ✅ Begin sizing work starting with testing projections, then customer projections.
