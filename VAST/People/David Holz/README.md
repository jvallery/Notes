# David Holz

## Profile

**Role**: Founder at Midjourney
**Relationship**: Target contact (prospect)

**Background**:
- Midjourney founder; team has many mutuals; exploring intro paths including via Henry Perez (Google).

## Recent Context

- 2025-11-07: [[2025-11-07 - Working session to brute-force warm paths into priority model builders using Lin]] - Working session for the Model Builder Turbine project to map warm introduction paths into priority m... (via Model Builder Turbine)

## Key Facts

- Targets reviewed included Thinking Machines, Reflection, Physical Intelligence, Midjourney, SSI (Safe Superintelligence Inc.), Perplexity, Cohere, Magic, Anthropic, and Apple.
- Reflection is reportedly discussing ~10,000 GB300s for an upcoming run.
- SSI outreach via OpenAI connections is considered non-viable due to conflict.
- Chris’s target list is primarily labs with $500M–$2B+ funding or strong bootstrapped revenue (e.g., Midjourney).
- Warm-intro quality varies; weak LinkedIn mutuals can waste cycles.
- Hyperscaler conflicts (Google/Microsoft) can block introductions.

## Background

David Holz co-founded Leap Motion in 2010, a company specializing in gesture-recognition technology for virtual reality. He served as CTO until 2021, when he founded Midjourney, an AI-driven image generation platform. Prior to his entrepreneurial ventures, Holz pursued a PhD in applied mathematics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and worked at NASA and the Max Planck Institute.

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Reframe outreach to focus on concrete pipeline components (Kafka for RL, real-time vector DB) rather than platform narratives.
- ✅ Use an NVIDIA-customer event (via AI Circle) as the primary NVIDIA intro mechanism; direct 1:1 intros from NVIDIA reps are unlikely.
- ✅ Broaden persona targeting to include data/pipeline owners, not just CTO-level contacts.
- ✅ Defer direct Google/Microsoft-introduced paths where conflicts exist to reduce hyperscaler conflict risk.
