## Key Facts

- GCP MVP will use routable IPs; customer must provide an IP range.
- GCP v1 performance observed: ~90% of theoretical read and ~50–60% of theoretical write; no standardized KPIs defined yet.
- Google has 8 failure domains; Azure typically has 3, impacting usable capacity/performance for HA designs.
- Marketplace activation expected to leverage an existing blanket private offer to avoid new approvals; pricing components still need tuning.
- MAI opportunity discussed at ~160,000 GPUs; follow-up planned Friday; storyline/deck due by Friday.
- Supercomputing presence includes VAST booth plus Google and Microsoft booths; ~10 end-user cloud meetings planned.
- Key dates: Ignite 2025-11-18 to 2025-11-21; re:Invent 2025-12-01 to 2025-12-05; planned Iceland trip 2025-12-08.

## Background

_Career history, expertise, interests, personal details shared..._

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Pursue dual-track go-to-market: marketplace offer for enterprise bursts plus sell-to hyperscaler-scale deals.
- ✅ Use routable IPs for GCP MVP; defer alias IPs/SaaS Runtime until post-launch.
- ✅ Adapt Enscale solution/deck for Microsoft/MAI with Kubernetes-led control plane and Polaris emphasis.
- ✅ Retain contractual control to avoid feature lock-out/abstraction in any Enscale/CoreWeave-like resale.
