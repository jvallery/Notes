# Rick Scurfield: New quote policy, hardware allocation guidance, and deal desk requirements

**Date**: 2025-12-17
**Attendees**: Rick Scurfield

## Summary

Rick Scurfield communicated an updated quoting policy and operational guidance to manage global hardware supply constraints and keep deals moving. Key changes include all outstanding quotes lapsing on December 31, 2025, moving to monthly price books with month-bound quote validity, and requiring Deal Desk sign-off for deals larger than 15 PB prior to quoting.

## Action Items

- [?] Place hardware orders as early as possible so they enter the allocation queue sooner. @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Keep Salesforce (SFDC) up to date to maintain a clear view of demand for hardware allocation planning. @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Build customer configurations using available hardware on hand whenever possible to accelerate fulfillment. @TBD #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Ensure any deal larger than 15 PB is routed to Deal Desk for sign-off prior to quoting, and ensure the quote is synced before requesting review. @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] For late-stage opportunities, sync all budgetary quotes to ensure visibility and execution across VAST Data and hardware partners. @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

## Decisions

- All outstanding VAST Data quotes will lapse on 2025-12-31, and any order placed by 2025-12-31 will be honored at the quoted price.

- VAST Data will move to monthly price books (with possible mid-month updates), and quotes will be valid only for the calendar month in which they are issued and approved.

- Any VAST Data deal larger than 15 PB requires Deal Desk sign-off prior to quoting, and only synced quotes are eligible for Deal Desk review.

- Partial licensing is no longer allowed, and all POCs must be paid.
