# Quote policy change and hardware allocation guidance (effective through 2025-12-31 and monthly price books in 2026)

**Date**: 2025-12-17
**Forum**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Rick Scurfield

## Summary

Rick Scurfield communicated an updated quoting policy and operational guidance due to a dynamic global hardware supply environment. Key changes include all outstanding quotes lapsing on 2025-12-31, monthly price books with calendar-month quote validity starting in 2026, and new controls for large deals and late-stage opportunity visibility.


## Action Items


- [?] Ensure all late-stage opportunities have budgetary quotes synced in SFDC to maintain visibility and enable execution planning with hardware partners. @TBD 📅 2025-12-31 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Place customer orders as early as possible to enter the hardware allocation queue sooner, and prioritize configurations using hardware currently on hand to accelerate fulfillment. @TBD 📅 2025-12-31 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Keep SFDC up to date to maintain an accurate view of demand for hardware allocation and planning. @TBD 📅 2025-12-31 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Route any deal larger than 15 PB to Deal Desk for sign-off prior to quoting, and ensure the quote is synced before requesting review. @TBD 📅 2026-01-01 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Stop offering partial licensing and ensure all POCs are structured as paid engagements in accordance with updated commercial policy. @TBD 📅 2025-12-31 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- VAST Data will lapse all outstanding quotes on 2025-12-31, while honoring quoted pricing for orders placed by 2025-12-31.

- VAST Data will move to monthly price books in 2026, with quotes valid only for the calendar month in which they are issued and approved (and prices may be updated mid-month).

- VAST Data will require Deal Desk sign-off prior to quoting for any deal larger than 15 PB, and will review only synced quotes.




## Key Information


- Rick Scurfield stated VAST Data is actively monitoring the global hardware supply environment and is closely engaged with suppliers and hardware partners, and will communicate changes in real time to support deal booking and customer updates.

- VAST Data policy: any order placed by 2025-12-31 will be honored at the quoted price, and all outstanding quotes will lapse on 2025-12-31.

- VAST Data policy starting in 2026: monthly price books will be released with the option to update prices mid-month; quotes issued and approved with an active price book are valid only for the calendar month in which they are issued (example given: quote approved 2026-01-10 valid through 2026-01-31 and lapses 2026-02-01).

- VAST Data policy: accepted purchase orders will be honored.

- VAST Data policy: any deal larger than 15 PB requires Deal Desk sign-off prior to quoting, and only synced quotes are eligible for review; Deal Desk will meet daily (including weekends as necessary) to ensure fast quote turnaround.

- VAST Data policy: customers are expected to accept hardware when hardware partners are ready to ship; if a customer delays acceptance, hardware partners may revise their pricing.

- VAST Data guidance: sales teams should place orders as early as possible to enter the allocation queue sooner, keep SFDC up to date to maintain visibility into demand, and build configurations with hardware on hand when possible to accelerate fulfillment.

- VAST Data policy reminders: partial licensing is no longer an option, and all POCs must be paid.

- VAST Data guidance: for late-stage opportunities, all budgetary quotes must be synced to ensure visibility and execution planning with hardware partners.

- Rick Scurfield directed the team to increase software pricing where possible, emphasizing confidence in the value delivered to customers.
