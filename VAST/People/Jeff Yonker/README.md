## Background

_Career history, expertise, interests, personal details shared..._

## Key Decisions

- (2025-12-21) Kushal made it clear that MAI will decide on the storage deployment.

- (2025-12-21) Renen will meet flash vendors and cannot change dates.

- (2025-12-27) Assume CoreWeave testing is largely a cosmetic exercise.

- Lior Genzel will take the lead on obtaining introductions to key MAI decision stakeholders (Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, Karén Simonyan) to reduce reliance on Kushal (last name unknown) as the primary conduit.
