# 1:1 with Rob Banga, maturing VAST support and customer success for SaaS/cloud operations

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**With**: Jason Vallery, Rob Banga, extraction_errors

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Rob Banga aligned on evolving VAST Data's support and customer success model to be cloud-caliber for an ERA SaaS storage platform. They discussed building proactive TAM/CSM capabilities, instituting cloud-grade incident management and developer on-call, defining premium support tiers with SLAs/SLOs and billing, and addressing data sovereignty and government-cleared support requirements.

## Action Items

- [?] Send candidate recommendations or referrals for SRE and CSM roles based on Jason Vallery's network (including prior Azure contacts where appropriate). @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Work with Rob Banga to define a cloud-grade incident management model for VAST Data, including developer on-call rotations and escalation paths. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Partner with Rob Banga to establish weekly metrics reviews and dashboards for support and NOC operations to drive prioritization using data rather than ad hoc escalation. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Send Rob Banga candidate referrals for SRE and CSM roles, leveraging Jason Vallery's network (including Azure/OCI contacts) and focusing on profiles that can learn cloud nuances while having strong VAST debugging capability. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Draft a job description for a proactive TAM/CSM-like role focused on hands-on customer engagement, proactive adoption, and roadmap alignment (not only reactive ticket handling). @Rob Banga 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Define and propose a cloud-grade incident management process for VAST Data, including developer on-call rotations for services they build and clear escalation paths with upstream cloud providers. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Stand up weekly metrics reviews for support and operations (including NOC) and use data to drive prioritization rather than ad hoc escalation pressure. @Rob Banga 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

## Decisions

- Prioritize building an SRE capability by rotating or hiring engineers with strong VAST product knowledge ('VAST DNA') and training them on cloud-provider nuances, rather than hiring cloud-only SREs who lack VAST debugging expertise.

- Move VAST Data toward a cloud/SaaS operating model with metrics-driven operations and cloud-grade incident management, including establishing developer on-call rotations.

- Prioritize building an SRE function by rotating or hiring engineers with strong VAST product knowledge and training them on cloud-provider specifics, rather than hiring cloud-only SREs without VAST debugging expertise.

- Move VAST Data's customer success model toward cloud operations maturity by instituting metrics-driven operations and cloud-grade incident management, including developer on-call rotations.

## Key Information

- Rob Banga has been at VAST Data for a little over three years.

- Rob Banga leads the customer organization responsible for support, professional services, account management, CSMs/TAMs, tools and automation, program managers, and a Network Operations Center (NOC).

- Under Rob Banga, the customer organization grew from roughly 20 people to roughly 130 people over three years, with an expectation to end the year around 140 to 150 people.

- VAST Data established a NOC with two people per shift to monitor alerts and respond quickly, including responding to Slack escalations.

- Rob Banga stated VAST Data is building toward operating at approximately 1,000-customer scale, and he estimated staffing might need to scale to roughly 180 to 200 people to support that level.

- Rob Banga has prior experience in OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure), Comcast, and EMC, and is trying to 'cloudify' VAST Data's support model based on that experience.

- Rob Banga stated VAST Data does not currently operate cloud-caliber incident management, including not having developers on an on-call rotation to support what they build.

- Rob Banga stated VAST Data needs more program management, change controls, and weekly metrics reviews, and that current prioritization can be driven by 'whoever screams loudest wins.'

- Jason Vallery spent 13 years on Azure Storage and left Microsoft as the product management lead for Microsoft's object storage platform.

- Jason Vallery's Azure experience included support model design, engineering engagement, SRE/live site operations, and capacity management for a hyperscale service.

- Jeff Denworth and Brandon (last name unknown) communicated a goal for VAST Data to become an 'ERA SaaS platform for storage,' implying VAST Data will own end-to-end operations for the service.

- Jason Vallery recommended staffing SRE roles with engineers who have strong VAST product knowledge ('VAST DNA') and training cloud-provider nuances, rather than hiring cloud-only SREs who lack VAST debugging expertise.

- Jason Vallery referenced alignment with Lior Genzel that cloud-provider fundamentals are similar and provider-specific nuances are trainable, while VAST product knowledge is harder to acquire quickly.
