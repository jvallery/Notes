# 1:1 with Rob Banga, maturing VAST support and customer success for SaaS/cloud operations

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**With**: Jason Vallery, Rob Banga, extraction_errors

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Rob Banga aligned on evolving VAST Data's support and customer success model to be cloud-caliber for an ERA SaaS storage platform. They discussed building proactive TAM/CSM capabilities, instituting cloud-grade incident management and developer on-call, defining premium support tiers with SLAs/SLOs and billing, and addressing data sovereignty and government-cleared support requirements.


## Action Items


- [?] Send Rob Banga candidate referrals for SRE and CSM roles, leveraging Jason Vallery's network (including Azure/OCI contacts) and focusing on profiles that can learn cloud nuances while having strong VAST debugging capability. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Draft a job description for a proactive TAM/CSM-like role focused on hands-on customer engagement, proactive adoption, and roadmap alignment (not only reactive ticket handling). @Rob Banga 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Define and propose a cloud-grade incident management process for VAST Data, including developer on-call rotations for services they build and clear escalation paths with upstream cloud providers. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Stand up weekly metrics reviews for support and operations (including NOC) and use data to drive prioritization rather than ad hoc escalation pressure. @Rob Banga 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Prioritize building an SRE function by rotating or hiring engineers with strong VAST product knowledge and training them on cloud-provider specifics, rather than hiring cloud-only SREs without VAST debugging expertise.

- Move VAST Data's customer success model toward cloud operations maturity by instituting metrics-driven operations and cloud-grade incident management, including developer on-call rotations.




## Key Information


- Rob Banga has been at VAST Data for a little over three years.

- Rob Banga leads a customer organization at VAST Data spanning support, professional services, account management, CSMs/TAMs, tools and automation, program managers, and a Network Operations Center (NOC).

- Under Rob Banga, the VAST Data customer organization grew from about 20 people to about 130 people over three years, with an expectation to end the year around 140 to 150 people.

- VAST Data established a NOC with two people per shift to monitor alerts and respond quickly, including responding in Slack.

- Rob Banga stated VAST Data is building toward 1,000-customer scale and estimated that could require roughly 180 to 200 people in the customer organization.

- Rob Banga has prior experience at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), Comcast, and EMC.

- Rob Banga believes VAST Data does not yet operate with cloud-caliber incident management and does not have developers on an on-call rotation for the code they write.

- Rob Banga is pushing VAST Data toward more program management, change controls, and weekly metrics reviews, and noted current prioritization can be driven by "whoever screams loudest."

- Jason Vallery spent 13 years working on Azure Storage and left Microsoft as the product management lead for Microsoft's object storage platform.

- Jason Vallery's Azure experience included support model design, engineering engagement, SRE and live-site operations, and capacity management for a hyperscale service.

- Jason Vallery stated Jeff Denworth and Brandon (last name not provided in transcript) communicated a goal for VAST Data to become an ERA SaaS platform for storage, with VAST owning end-to-end operations.

- Jason Vallery recommended staffing SRE roles with strong VAST product knowledge ("VAST DNA") and training cloud-provider nuances, rather than hiring cloud-only SREs who would be unfamiliar with debugging VAST issues.

- Jason Vallery referenced alignment with Lior Genzel on the importance of "VAST DNA" for SRE staffing and noted cloud-provider fundamentals are similar but have trainable nuances.
