## Key Facts

- Timo leads Corporate Finance (FP&A, planning, IR, corp dev) and joined VAST ~11 months ago under CFO Amy Shapiro.
- VAST is ~1100 people and Amy is the first CFO; finance bandwidth/coverage is constrained.
- Boston hub has ~40–45 employees including Marian Budnick (CMO), Jason Ainsworth (CAO), and Joe Stevens (data).
- Investor valuation lens for the next ~3 years is a growth-adjusted ARR multiple.
- Current pricing is primarily $/TB with $/compute added mid-Q2; discount discipline is poor with wide price dispersion.
- Unit-based pricing ('VAST units') is viewed as a way to normalize pricing across cohorts and across storage/compute and on-prem/cloud, while easing migration to a new model.
- Key risks include customer backlash/contraction from inconsistent pricing and deal-level discount leakage when cloud SKUs are undiscountable.
