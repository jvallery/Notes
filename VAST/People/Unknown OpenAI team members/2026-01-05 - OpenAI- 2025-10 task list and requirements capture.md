# OpenAI: 2025-10 task list and requirements capture

**Date**: 2026-01-05
**Account**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Jason Vallery, Unknown OpenAI team members

## Summary

Captured and completed three OpenAI-related action items: validate storage API requirements for GPU-adjacent access, gather global KV store performance requirements and assess VAST feasibility, and coordinate a potential in-person meeting in San Francisco on November 4-6, 2025.


## Action Items


- [?] Confirm with OpenAI teams whether S3 API is sufficient for GPU-adjacent storage access or whether Azure Blob API parity is required. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Capture OpenAI requirements for a global key-value store (TPS per PB, IO size <=64 KB) and assess feasibility on VAST Data. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Work with OpenAI on scheduling a possible in-person meeting in San Francisco during November 4-6, 2025. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- OpenAI teams are evaluating whether an S3-compatible API is sufficient for GPU-adjacent storage access, or whether Azure Blob API parity is required.

- OpenAI has requirements for a global key-value store including throughput expressed as TPS per PB and IO size of up to 64 KB.

- Jason Vallery coordinated with OpenAI on a possible in-person meeting in San Francisco during November 4-6, 2025.
