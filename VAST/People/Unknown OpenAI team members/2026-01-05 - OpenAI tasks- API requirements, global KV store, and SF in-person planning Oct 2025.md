# OpenAI tasks: API requirements, global KV store, and SF in-person planning (Oct 2025)

**Date**: 2026-01-05
**Account**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Jason Vallery, Unknown OpenAI team members

## Summary

Captured and completed three OpenAI-related action items: validate whether S3 API is sufficient vs needing Blob API parity for GPU-adjacent storage, gather global KV store requirements and assess VAST feasibility, and coordinate a potential in-person meeting in San Francisco on November 4-6, 2025.


## Action Items


- [?] Confirm with OpenAI teams whether S3 API is sufficient for GPU-adjacent storage access or whether Azure Blob API parity is required. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Capture OpenAI requirements for a global key-value store (including TPS per PB and <=64 KB IO) and assess feasibility on the VAST Data platform. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with OpenAI on a possible in-person meeting in San Francisco on November 4-6, 2025. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- OpenAI is evaluating GPU-adjacent storage access requirements and needs confirmation whether an S3 API is sufficient or whether Azure Blob API parity is required.

- OpenAI has requirements for a global key-value store, including throughput expressed as TPS per PB and IO sizes up to 64 KB, and asked VAST Data to assess feasibility on the VAST platform.

- OpenAI and VAST Data discussed a possible in-person meeting in San Francisco on November 4-6, 2025.
