## Key Facts

- Kurt is global pre-sales lead for AI Infra under Zia; his team scores constrained GPU allocations and must approve any allocation of constrained SKUs.
- Kurt’s proposal: GA Azure Extended Zones as network-only plus AKS NodeJoin (ACAS FlexNode) to connect neo/sovereign cloud training sites to Azure for global inference.
- VAST vs Azure Blob per 1 EB: ~1/10 racks, ~1/5 megawatts, >=5x performance, but ~2x capex.
- Azure Marketplace VAST offer on L-series VMs is not density/cost competitive for real workloads; positioned as a checkbox.
- Apollo ownership boundaries: Chi owns bare-metal control plane; Sky/Overlake owns security; Ronnie Booker’s org owns chassis/layout/storage placement decisions.
- Azure MAI/Falcon issues include lack of topology-aware scheduling; rack-level placement not expected until ~Feb; IB/telemetry improving.
- OpenAI infra leadership changed: Uday (ex-xAI) now runs infra at OpenAI and reports to Greg Brockman; may reduce Microsoft alignment; power is a major Azure constraint.
- Kurt expected A2N approval for Extended Zones/NodeJoin in ~3 weeks; target partners include sovereign/neo-clouds such as sakura.net in Japan.
- Targets reviewed included Thinking Machines, Reflection, Physical Intelligence, Midjourney, SSI (Safe Superintelligence Inc.), Perplexity, Cohere, Magic, Anthropic, and Apple.
- Reflection is reportedly discussing ~10,000 GB300s for an upcoming run.

## Background

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Pursue a BizDev-led path (Joe Vane/Harish) to secure executive sponsorship (John Tinter) and engage Ronnie Booker’s org, rather than focusing on Nidhi/Manish.
- ✅ Treat the Azure Marketplace VM-based VAST offer as a checkbox while pushing a hardware/OEM storage-dense path for real density wins.
- ✅ Reframe outreach to focus on concrete pipeline components (Kafka for RL, real-time vector DB) rather than platform narratives.
- ✅ Use an NVIDIA-customer event (via AI Circle) as the primary NVIDIA intro mechanism; direct 1:1 intros from NVIDIA reps are unlikely.
- ✅ Broaden persona targeting to include data/pipeline owners, not just CTO-level contacts.
- ✅ Defer direct Google/Microsoft-introduced paths where conflicts exist to reduce hyperscaler conflict risk.
