# Karl Vietmeier asks for guidance on ownership of GDC and Azure Local opportunities

**Date**: 2025-12-01
**With**: Karl Vietmeier, Jason Vallery

## Summary

Karl Vietmeier reports growing interest in whether VAST supports Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local, and notes that opportunities often shift from cloud to on-prem ownership once hardware is involved. He recommends cloud product management own these opportunities to avoid accountability confusion and to maintain alignment with hyperscaler-led acquisition and cloud consumption, and asks Jason Vallery how aggressively to assert ownership.

## Action Items

- [?] Provide guidance to Karl Vietmeier on how aggressively cloud product management should assert ownership of Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local opportunities versus allowing on-prem teams to take ownership when hardware is involved. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

## Key Information

- Karl Vietmeier is a Cloud Solutions Architect focused on VAST on Cloud at VAST Data.

- VAST Data is seeing growing interest from the market in whether VAST supports Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local.

- When GDC or Azure Local opportunities involve hardware, VAST Data on-prem teams tend to take ownership, which creates confusion over accountability and reduces cloud team visibility into progress and outcomes.

- Karl Vietmeier believes GDC and Azure Local opportunities should be managed through cloud product management because cloud PM has the strongest hyperscaler relationships and these solutions are expected to be acquired through hyperscalers and tied to cloud consumption.
