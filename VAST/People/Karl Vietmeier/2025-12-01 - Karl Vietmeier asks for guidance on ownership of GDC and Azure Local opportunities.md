# Karl Vietmeier asks for guidance on ownership of GDC and Azure Local opportunities

**Date**: 2025-12-01
**With**: Karl Vietmeier, Jason Vallery

## Summary

Karl Vietmeier reports growing interest in VAST support for Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local and notes confusion when on-prem teams take ownership once hardware is involved. He recommends cloud product management own these opportunities due to hyperscaler relationships and cloud-consumption acquisition, and asks Jason Vallery how aggressively to assert ownership and how much control to maintain.


## Action Items


- [?] Provide guidance to Karl Vietmeier on how aggressively VAST Data cloud product management should assert ownership of Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local opportunities and what level of control cloud PM should maintain versus on-prem teams. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Karl Vietmeier is a Cloud Solutions Architect for VAST on Cloud at VAST Data.

- Karl Vietmeier is seeing growing market interest in whether VAST Data supports Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local.

- Karl Vietmeier observes that GDC and Azure Local opportunities often start as cloud opportunities but shift to on-prem team ownership once hardware is involved, creating confusion over accountability and reducing cloud team's visibility into progress and outcomes.

- Karl Vietmeier believes GDC and Azure Local opportunities should be managed through VAST Data cloud product management because cloud PM has the strongest hyperscaler relationships and these solutions are expected to be acquired through hyperscalers and tied to cloud consumption.
