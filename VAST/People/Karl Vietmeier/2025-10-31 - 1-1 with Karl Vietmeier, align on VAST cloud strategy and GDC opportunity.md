# 1:1 with Karl Vietmeier, align on VAST cloud strategy and GDC opportunity

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**With**: Jason Vallery, Karl Vietmeier

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Karl Vietmeier held an introductory 1:1 to align on VAST Data's cloud strategy, including a long-term goal of a multi-tenant SaaS platform across hyperscalers and neo-clouds. They discussed Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP dynamics, the need for control-plane integrations (API, monitoring, billing), and the importance of cloud economics via capacity and performance decoupling using object/S3 offload.

- Karl Vietmeier previously worked at Microsoft for about 1.5 years as an Advanced Storage Global Black Belt (GBB), but the team was dissolved about a month after he joined and he was moved to Azure Virtual Desktop.

- Karl Vietmeier reported frustration at Microsoft that his NetApp experience and internal connections were not leveraged, and he described Microsoft as difficult to join mid or late career without an internal network to support role stability during annual reorgs.

- Karl Vietmeier returned to Intel after Microsoft and worked on Intel's telco team supporting Microsoft, including design-in and sell motions for Azure for Operators.
