# Karl Vietmeier asks for guidance on Cloud PM ownership for GDC and Azure Local opportunities

**Date**: 2025-12-01
**With**: Myself, Karl Vietmeier

## Summary

Karl Vietmeier flagged growing inbound interest in support for Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local and noted that ownership often shifts to on-prem teams once hardware is involved. He recommends Cloud Product Management own these opportunities to avoid accountability confusion and to align execution with hyperscaler relationships and cloud consumption motions.


## Action Items


- [?] Provide guidance to Karl Vietmeier on how aggressively Cloud Product Management should assert ownership for Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local opportunities, including what level of control Cloud PM should maintain vs on-prem teams when hardware is involved. @Myself 📅 2025-12-03 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Karl Vietmeier is seeing growing interest from the field in whether VAST Data supports Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local, and these often start as cloud opportunities.

- Karl Vietmeier observes that when GDC or Azure Local opportunities involve hardware, VAST Data on-prem teams tend to take ownership, which creates confusion over accountability and reduces visibility into progress and outcomes.

- Karl Vietmeier believes GDC and Azure Local opportunities should be managed through Cloud Product Management because Cloud PM has the strongest hyperscaler relationships and these solutions are expected to be acquired through hyperscalers and tied to cloud consumption.
