# Karl Vietmeier

## Profile

**Role**: Technical specialist / SE/TME (cloud/distributed systems) at VAST Data (Cloud (implied))
**Location**: Inland Empire (near Pomona/Diamond Bar), Los Angeles area
**Relationship**: Internal collaborator

**Background**:
- Maintains a capacity/overhead calculator sheet with explicit FS and SCM overhead terms (~8% FS + ~3% SCM) referenced as inputs to parameterize.
- Not directly discussed in transcript; included in known entities but not referenced in this note's narrative.
- Helped run Google demo/test case showing global namespace across Japan↔Ohio regions; part of TPU benchmark/demo effort.

## Open Tasks

- [ ] Parameterize Karl’s calculator with cloud/region, zones, FD count, per-zone/per-FD SKU counts, EC width, non-EC overheads, rebuild headroom, and rolling-update headroom; output “available capacity” and derived overhead % for pricing.
- [ ] Work with Karl and dev leads to wire calculator inputs into deployment tooling so customer-facing “available capacity” matches deployed striping for the chosen region/SKU.
