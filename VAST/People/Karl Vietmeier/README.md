## Topics

- VAST Data cloud strategy, long-term multi-tenant SaaS vision across hyperscalers and neo-clouds

- Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP via Cisco and required control-plane integrations (API, monitoring, billing)

- Cloud economics and architecture: decoupling capacity from performance using object/S3 offload

- Upstream ecosystem integrations to strengthen differentiation (Spark, Trino, Vertex AI, Bigtable)

- Microsoft career experience: Global Black Belt team dissolution, Azure Virtual Desktop reassignment, and Azure for Operators context

## Key Decisions

- P0 priority for VAST cloud viability is enabling capacity scaling independent of performance via object/S3 offload (cloud economics requirement).

- The VAST cloud team will spearhead GDC-style and neo-cloud single-tenant GPU-adjacent storage opportunities, coordinating required control-plane integrations (API, monitoring, billing).
