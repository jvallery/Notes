# Karl Vietmeier

## Key Facts

- Karl Vietmeier previously worked at Microsoft for about 1.5 years as a Global Black Belt (advanced storage), and the advanced storage GBB team was dissolved about a month after he joined, after which he was moved to Azure Virtual Desktop.

- Karl Vietmeier previously worked at NetApp for about four years and had strong familiarity and relationships with the Azure NetApp Files (ANF) ecosystem (SCE/CSE contacts).

- Karl Vietmeier returned to Intel after Microsoft and worked on Intel's telco team supporting Microsoft, including design-in and sell motions for Azure for Operators.

- Karl Vietmeier believes Microsoft can be difficult to join mid or late career without an internal network to support role stability during annual reorgs and 'musical chairs'.

- Karl Vietmeier was asked to provide the expected performance profile for an Azure VoC instance.

- Karl Vietmeier was told by Lior Genzel that he is optional on the follow-up call with Microsoft Azure regarding the Azure VoC request.

- Karl Vietmeier is a Cloud Solutions Architect focused on VAST on Cloud at VAST Data.

- Karl Vietmeier believes GDC and Azure Local opportunities should be managed through cloud product management because cloud PM has the strongest hyperscaler relationships and these solutions are expected to be acquired through hyperscalers and tied to cloud consumption.

- Karl Vietmeier was asked to define the expected performance profile for an Azure VoC instance.

- Lior Genzel told Karl Vietmeier that Karl is optional on the follow-up call with Microsoft Azure because Lior plans to block the Azure VoC request.

- Karl Vietmeier believes GDC and Azure Local opportunities should be managed through cloud product management because cloud product management has the strongest hyperscaler relationships and these solutions are expected to be acquired through hyperscalers and tied to cloud consumption.

- Karl Vietmeier is seeing growing interest from the field/market in whether VAST Data supports Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local.

- Karl Vietmeier observes that opportunities that start as cloud opportunities often shift to on-prem team ownership once hardware is involved, which creates confusion over accountability and reduces visibility into progress and outcomes.

- Karl Vietmeier believes Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local opportunities should be managed through cloud product management because cloud PM has the strongest hyperscaler relationships and these solutions are expected to be acquired through hyperscalers and tied to cloud consumption.

- Karl Vietmeier was asked by Ray Coetzee to provide the expected performance profile for an Azure VoC instance for Microsoft testing.

- Lior Genzel told Karl Vietmeier that Karl is optional on the follow-up call with Microsoft Azure because Lior plans to block the request.

## Key Decisions

- P0 priority for VAST cloud viability is enabling capacity scaling independent of performance via object/S3 offload (cloud economics requirement).

- The VAST cloud team will spearhead GDC-style and neo-cloud single-tenant GPU-adjacent storage opportunities, coordinating required control-plane integrations (API, monitoring, billing).
