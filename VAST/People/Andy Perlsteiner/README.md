## Key Facts

- A 1:1 with Andy Bernstein was set up to learn meeting rhythms and communication channels; task completed on 2025-10-27.
- VAST currently lacks OKR/KR rigor and end-to-end traceability from tasks to strategy.
- Engineering effort for cloud success depends heavily on core product changes; PM process must cover the whole stack.
- Jeff is cautious about structural change and prefers Jason to learn the org before proposing changes.
- Renan resists traditional PM authority/ownership.
- Shahar prefers ambiguity and resists strict structure and gating.
- Cloud and core teams have misaligned processes and limited workflow overlap.
- Poor ticket/epic structure reduces delivery visibility and makes it hard to answer customer/status questions (example: MD migrate release movement).
- Any PM framework must be top-down endorsed by Jeff and Sahar to succeed.
