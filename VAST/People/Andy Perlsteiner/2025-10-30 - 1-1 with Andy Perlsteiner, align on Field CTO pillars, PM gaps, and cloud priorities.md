# 1:1 with Andy Perlsteiner, align on Field CTO pillars, PM gaps, and cloud priorities

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**With**: Jason Vallery, Andy Perlsteiner, Blake (last name unknown), Josh (last name unknown), Phil Wagstrom, Ray Coetzee, Tomer Hagay, Timo Pervane, Aaron Zilber, Jeff Denworth, Yonce (last name unknown), Galit (last name unknown), Orly (last name unknown)

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Andy Perlsteiner aligned on Andy’s Field CTO team scope, major process gaps (docs, training ownership, PRDs vs FRDs, release visibility), and how PM and field should collaborate. Jason shared his initial charter to make VAST on Cloud sellable (marketplace objects, CSP VM shapes, multi-tenancy toward SaaS, and pricing/legal alignment). They identified an urgent product gap, Sync Engine lacks PM ownership and needs Azure Blob source support for wave.ai’s December 2025 migration timeline.

- Schedule a follow-up deep-dive focused on OpenAI architecture, workloads, and VAST fit.

## Key Information

- Andy Perlsteiner has been at VAST Data for almost eight years and operates beyond formal role boundaries due to deep internal history and relationships.

- Andy Perlsteiner’s Field CTO organization has four pillars: (1) pre-sales field escalation and POC support for SEs and sales, (2) lab management for demos, hosted POCs, benchmarks, and feature testing, (3) SE enablement and training for new releases and features plus technical augmentation for Product Management, and (4) marketing support (webinars, blog posts, videos).

- Andy Perlsteiner’s team develops SE training per release (example: VAST Data release 5.4) by assigning owners per major feature, engaging engineering during implementation, and attending implementation reviews to build consumable enablement content.

- Andy Perlsteiner believes Product Management at VAST Data is under-resourced and often cannot go deep enough technically to deploy and troubleshoot features in real customer POCs, so his team acts as technical augmentation to PM.

- Jason Vallery’s initial cloud charter is to make VAST on Cloud sellable by driving marketplace objects (partnering with Yonce), pushing CSPs starting with Microsoft Azure for better VM shapes, driving multi-tenancy backlog toward SaaS, and aligning cloud business models with Timo Pervane (pricing and legal).

- VAST Data’s OVA exists but is unsupported; it requires approximately 128 GB RAM on the host, client networking requires tunneling or proxies, and it is positioned as a one-VM multi-container demo rather than a production deployment.

- VAST Data SE Lab access is via VPN and octo.selab.fastdata.com using an AD account; client VMs are available and there are multiple clusters (including GA and 5.4), with some environments restricted to tenant-admin access.

- Access to VAST Data GitLab (get.vastdata.com) is restricted and requires an IT ticket for a licensed account.

- Release process hygiene includes attending phase gates and implementation reviews (run by Galit and Orly) and reviewing Confluence release pages (example: 5.4 dev) and FRDs.

- Phil Wagstrom is the primary subject matter expert for VAST Data multi-tenancy, with Ray Coetzee as another multi-tenancy SME (UK).

- A biweekly Tomer Hagay to Octo and field sync exists, and Jason Vallery was added to an OctoPM Monday sync.

- Sync Engine has no formal Product Manager; Andy Perlsteiner and Blake (last name unknown) are acting PMs to fill the gap.

- wave.ai has approximately 100 PB in Azure Blob Storage in Sweden and plans to migrate about 50 PB to CoreWeave while syncing checkpoints back to Azure; this requires Sync Engine to read from Azure Blob as a source for migration.

- Aaron Zilber is investigating Azure Blob APIs for both implementation and migration-read use cases, and he is out of office for approximately 2.5 weeks during a period when wave.ai needs an early December migration start.

- OpenAI’s described architecture pattern includes multi-exabyte data lakes in three Azure regions for CPU and Spark/Databricks workloads, GPUs in 50+ regions plus CoreWeave and Oracle, and a GPU-adjacent cache with checkpoints written back to a central store.

- Jason Vallery and Andy Perlsteiner discussed skepticism that VAST on Cloud is currently economically competitive versus first-party cloud capacity storage, and that VAST’s differentiated value may be higher-level compute integration plus a global data plane and namespace across providers ("data spaces").

- Andy Perlsteiner has been at VAST Data for almost eight years and his role has evolved based on deep internal history and relationships.

- Andy Perlsteiner’s Field CTO team operates across four pillars: (1) pre-sales field escalation and POC support for SEs and sales, (2) lab management for demos, hosted POCs, benchmarks, and feature testing, (3) SE enablement and training for new releases and features, plus technical augmentation for Product Management, and (4) marketing support (webinars, blog posts, videos).

- VAST documentation is perceived as overly technical and not scenario-driven, described as reading like a 'car stereo manual'; scenario guides are ad hoc and arrive late.

- There are Product Management process gaps at VAST Data including unclear training ownership, engineering writing FRDs instead of PM-owned PRDs, limited release visibility, and limited access to builds and documentation for PMs.

- Jason Vallery’s stated charter is to make VAST on Cloud sellable by driving marketplace objects (partnering with Yonce), pushing CSPs starting with Microsoft Azure for better VM shapes, driving multi-tenancy backlog toward SaaS, and aligning cloud pricing and legal models with Timo Pervane.

- The current VAST on Cloud fit is viewed as economically weak versus first-party cloud capacity storage; the likely differentiated value is higher-level compute-adjacent workflows and a global data plane.

- OpenAI’s described pattern is multi-exabyte data lakes in three Microsoft Azure regions for CPU and analytics (Spark and Databricks), with GPUs distributed across 50+ regions plus CoreWeave and Oracle; they use GPU-adjacent cache and checkpoint back to central storage.

- VAST Data’s opportunity discussed is to provide a common global data plane and global namespace across cloud providers, described as 'data spaces'.

- VAST’s OVA exists but is unsupported; it requires approximately 128 GB RAM on the host, client networking requires tunneling or proxies, and it is a single-VM multi-container demo deployment.

- SE Lab access is via VPN and octo.selab.fastdata.com using an AD account; client VMs are available; there are multiple clusters including GA and 5.4, and some environments are tenant-admin only.

- GitLab access at get.vastdata.com is restricted and requires an IT ticket for a licensed account.

- Release hygiene guidance: attend phase gates and implementation reviews run by Galit and Orly, and review Confluence release pages (example: 5.4 dev) and FRDs.

- Multi-tenancy subject matter experts identified: Phil Wagstrom as primary and Ray Coetzee (UK) as another SME.

- A biweekly Tomer Hagay to Octo and field sync exists, and Jason Vallery was added to the OctoPM Monday sync.

- Sync Engine has no formal Product Manager; Andy Perlsteiner and an individual named Blake (last name not provided) are acting PMs.

- wave.ai has approximately 100 PB in Azure Blob Storage in Sweden and plans to migrate about 50 PB to CoreWeave while syncing checkpoints back to Azure; this requires Sync Engine to read from Azure Blob as a migration source.

- Aaron Zilber is investigating Azure Blob APIs for both implementation and migration-read use cases, and he is out of office for approximately 2.5 weeks during a period when early December 2025 migration start is needed.
