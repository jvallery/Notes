## Open Tasks
```tasks
path includes Alon Horev
not done
```

## Topics

- Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) org context, including Kushal's role and relationship to Mustafa

- Falcon rollout plan: Phoenix, Dallas, Richmond, AI WAN interconnect, and storage sizing assumptions

- MAI operational blockers: control plane fragility and GPU issues limiting Falcon utilization

- Implications of OpenAI GPT-4.5 training experience on cluster scaling philosophy

- Project Apollo architecture: AKS-led slim control plane for single-tenant GPU sites and VAST integration opportunity

## Key Decisions

- Alon Horev will wait until after Jason Vallery's Friday meeting with Kushal before following up with Vipin to avoid misalignment and to incorporate the latest MAI direction.

- VAST Data will prioritize Project Apollo (AKS-led slim control plane for single-tenant GPU sites) as the primary entry path into Microsoft MAI and Azure-adjacent deployments, rather than relying on Azure Marketplace VM offers (LSv4/LSv5).

- VAST Data will use success in Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) as a wedge to influence broader Azure storage strategy and to justify a longer-term Azure hardware qualification path.

- Blob API compatibility will be treated as exploratory; near-term focus remains on performance outcomes that keep GPUs utilized in MAI environments.
