# Google Distributed Cloud RFP debrief and federal coordination (air-gapped storage replacement for NetApp)

**Date**: 2025-11-14
**Project**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Jason Vallery, Alon Horev, Jennifer Azzolina, Jeremiah Hinrichs, Greg Castellucci, Randy Hayes

## Summary

VAST cloud and federal teams aligned on responding to Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP to replace NetApp storage, with a strong focus on air-gapped deployments, compliance evidence, and operational readiness. The team agreed on clear owners for Google Federal engagement, RFP content assembly, and a 1:1 with new GDC leader Muninder Singh Sambi, and plans to use the Fort Meade "Gemini as a service" on-prem effort as a near-term joint validation path.


## Action Items


- [?] Send an intro email connecting Greg Castellucci to Google GDC corporate and Google Federal stakeholders and share the GDC RFP package. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Assemble GDC RFP supplemental materials covering compliance and attestations (including DISA STIG expectations if required), encryption and certifications, multi-tenancy, quotas, tagging integration, and troubleshooting and operations model for air-gapped deployments. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Own and submit the formal end-to-end Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP response, coordinating inputs across VAST teams (confirm whether owner is Leo or Lior Genzel). @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Run point with Google Federal and Google corporate GDC teams, coordinate near-term meetings, and drive the joint validation path for the GDC RFP pursuit. @Greg Castellucci #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule and conduct a 1:1 with Muninder Singh Sambi to review AI approach, preferred VM shapes, RDMA requirements, and hardware tradeoffs for Google Distributed Cloud deployments. @Alon Horev #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide a list of federal air-gapped customers and obfuscated past performance references that can be used in the GDC RFP response. @Jennifer Azzolina #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide federal compliance and ATO summaries and links to public artifacts suitable for inclusion in the GDC RFP response. @Jeremiah Hinrichs #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Google and Cisco on Fort Meade rack-and-stack progress and confirm validation scope for Q4 2025. @Greg Castellucci #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Prepare an EBC-style briefing for Google on AI workloads, storage patterns, and air-gapped operations relevant to Google Distributed Cloud. @Randy Hayes #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Draft recommended Dell and HPE hardware SKUs and deployment patterns for Google Distributed Cloud air-gapped deployments. @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Set a near-term meeting with Google GDC team to review RFP Q&A and air-gapped operations posture. @Greg Castellucci #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule an internal architecture review to decide on Dell, HPE, Cisco hardware vs commodity VM deployment approach for Google Distributed Cloud. @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Link VAST Federal sellers with Google Federal for FBI, State, and Army opportunities related to Google Distributed Cloud. @Greg Castellucci 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm whether Fort Meade status can be cited in the GDC RFP response as active validation or past performance reference. @Jennifer Azzolina 🔽 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Greg Castellucci will run point for engagement with Google Federal and coordinate with Google’s corporate Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) team for the RFP pursuit over the next few weeks.

- Jason Vallery will coordinate assembly of the Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP response content and connect Greg Castellucci with the relevant Google stakeholders.

- Alon Horev will schedule and conduct a 1:1 with Muninder Singh Sambi to discuss AI approach, preferred VM shapes, RDMA requirements, and hardware tradeoffs for GDC deployments.

- A person referred to as "Leo" will own the end-to-end formal GDC RFP response and submission, coordinating inputs across VAST teams (owner identity needs confirmation).

- VAST will use the Fort Meade "Gemini as a service" on-prem initiative as the primary near-term joint validation path and reference for the GDC RFP response.

- The RFP response will include recommended Dell and HPE hardware SKUs and will consider Cisco hardware and commodity VM deployment options.




## Key Information


- Jason Vallery started at VAST Data around late October 2025 (about three weeks before 2025-11-14) and reports to Jeff Denworth, leading product management for cloud and hyperscaler partnerships.

- Jason Vallery previously spent 13 years at Microsoft running product management for Azure Blob Storage (Azure Storage).

- Randy Hayes is Vice President of Public Sector at VAST Data and owns federal business; he previously worked at Avere and spent about 45 days at Microsoft after the Avere acquisition before joining VAST Data about 7.5 years prior to 2025-11-14.

- Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) has connected and air-gapped variants; Google’s current storage partner for GDC is NetApp, and Google issued a US-based RFP seeking a storage replacement for GDC.

- Google’s GDC RFP evaluation emphasizes air-gapped support, compliance and attestations, operational model (updates, staffing, troubleshooting), multi-tenancy, quotas, encryption, and tagging.

- Muninder Singh Sambi is a new leader for Google Distributed Cloud and is focused on dark-site readiness, compliance, operational posture, and rapid joint validation.

- Fort Meade "Gemini as a service" on-prem initiative is described as an in-flight Q4 commitment and is intended to be used as a near-term joint validation path for the GDC RFP response.

- GDC deployments commonly run on Dell hardware, and have also involved HPE and Cisco gear; the team plans to include recommended Dell and HPE SKUs and consider Cisco or commodity VM options.

- VAST Data recently launched Google Marketplace offers, but the broader VAST Data and Google partnership is still early-stage.

- VAST Federal has active relationships with Google’s DoD/IC organization led by Jan Niemus and is also coordinating with Cisco for a proof of concept.

- Greg Castellucci was designated to run point with Google Federal and coordinate with Google’s corporate GDC team for the RFP pursuit.

- Jason Vallery was designated to coordinate RFP content assembly and connect Greg Castellucci with Google stakeholders for the GDC RFP pursuit.

- Alon Horev was designated to pursue a 1:1 with Muninder Singh Sambi to cover AI approach, VM shapes, RDMA, and hardware tradeoffs for GDC deployments.

- A person referred to as "Leo" was stated to own the formal end-to-end GDC RFP response and submission, but the transcript notes ambiguity about whether "Leo" is the same person as Lior Genzel.
