# Walmart big data DR requirements ambiguity, hybrid cloud roadmap narrative, and Mingming call setup

**Date**: 2025-11-14
**Account**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Jason Vallery, Mikey, Brad, Paul

## Summary

Internal VAST sync to align on Walmart's big data initiative and unblock customer engagement. The team agreed not to schedule an architecture or whiteboarding session until Walmart clarifies disaster recovery requirements, specifically whether they need full VAST namespace access in cloud or only a data copy. Jason Vallery will lead a 30-minute expectations and vision call with Mingming on 2025-11-14 after 2 pm PT, positioning current capabilities and the forward hybrid roadmap, including more native Google Cloud Storage integration.


## Action Items


- [?] Schedule and send invite for a 30-minute call with Walmart contact Mingming on 2025-11-14 after 2 pm PT. @Mikey 📅 2025-11-14 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Collect Walmart's answers to the requirements questions (including DR requirement details) and share them in Slack before the Mingming call. @Mikey 📅 2025-11-14 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Lead the 30-minute customer call with Mingming on 2025-11-14 after 2 pm PT, positioning current VAST capabilities and the hybrid cloud roadmap narrative for Walmart's big data initiative. @Myself 📅 2025-11-14 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Join the Mingming call on 2025-11-14 after 2 pm PT to support with context and Q&A for Walmart's big data initiative. @Brad 📅 2025-11-14 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Join the Mingming call on 2025-11-14 after 2 pm PT to support with context and Q&A for Walmart's big data initiative. @Paul 📅 2025-11-14 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Notify Alon Horev about the 2025-11-14 after 2 pm PT discussion with Walmart (Mingming) and share context in case he can join. @Myself 📅 2025-11-14 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate Tel Aviv engineering sessions (week after 2025-11-14) to define requirements and roadmap for more native Google Cloud Storage integration driven by Walmart hybrid big data needs. @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] After Walmart clarifies requirements, schedule an architecture or whiteboarding session with the appropriate VAST SMEs for the Walmart big data DR and hybrid design. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Reconfirm Walmart's timeline and decision process for selecting between the minimum configuration and the larger phase-one configuration. @Mikey #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Do not schedule a Walmart architecture or whiteboarding session until Walmart provides definitive requirements, especially around disaster recovery (full VAST namespace access in cloud versus data copy).

- Hold off on providing detailed technical answers in Slack until after a customer expectations and vision call with Mingming sets context and direction.

- Lead with current VAST capabilities plus a forward-looking hybrid cloud roadmap narrative in the initial customer call, then escalate to a deeper technical session with additional SMEs after requirements are confirmed.




## Key Information


- Walmart's big data initiative has an unclear disaster recovery requirement, specifically whether Walmart needs full VAST namespace access in a public cloud for DR or only a copy of the data.

- VAST's current approach of running VAST on public cloud VMs is not viable for Walmart's anticipated scale for DR and hybrid big data use cases.

- VAST is driving a hybrid cloud roadmap that includes deeper, more native integration with Google Cloud Storage, which VAST cannot do today.

- Jason Vallery plans to meet with VAST engineering in Tel Aviv the week after 2025-11-14 to specify the roadmap shape for hybrid cloud capabilities, using Walmart as a marquee design partner for hybrid cloud big data projects.

- Walmart is evaluating two VAST proposals for the big data initiative, a minimum configuration versus a larger phase-one configuration, with the primary difference being D-boxes and capacity.

- Walmart's decision timeline for selecting between the minimum configuration and the larger phase-one proposal is approximately 1 to 1.5 months from 2025-11-14.

- The Walmart big data opportunity was discussed as potentially scaling to approximately 500 PB and framed as up to a $300M deal if successful.
