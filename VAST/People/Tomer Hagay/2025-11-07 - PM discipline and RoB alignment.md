# PM discipline and RoB alignment

**Date**: 2025-11-07
**With**: Jason Vallery, Tomer Hagay

## Summary

Jason and Tomer aligned that VAST needs clearer product management discipline (OKRs/KRs, traceability from epics to tasks, and a defined rhythm of business) to improve delivery visibility and customer responsiveness. They discussed leadership resistance to formal PM structure (Jeff prioritizing revenue/flexibility, Renan resisting PM authority, and Shahar preferring ambiguity) and agreed any change must be top-down and org-wide across cloud and core. They agreed to defer drafting a proposal until after the Tel Aviv onsite next week, then jointly prepare a concise skunkworks proposal to present to Jeff (and likely Sahar).
## Action Items
- [ ?] Draft an outline for a PM framework (scope, accountability gates, RoB cadence, OKR/KR mapping) to socialize with Jeff/Sahar. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ?] Map current cloud–core workflow interfaces and handoffs to ensure any PM process spans the full stack. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed
- [ ?] Schedule a joint review with Jeff (and invite Sahar) to discuss the proposal after the Tel Aviv onsite. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ?] Meet in person in Tel Aviv to observe processes and align on proposal approach. @Myself 📅 2025-11-10 #task #proposed
- [ ?] Compile concrete pain points and examples (e.g., epic/ticket gaps, release slippage like MD migrate) to inform the proposal. @Tomer Hagay 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed
- [ ?] Reconnect post–Tel Aviv to finalize proposal scope and presentation plan for leadership. @Tomer Hagay 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed

## Decisions
- Defer proposal drafting until after the Tel Aviv onsite next week.
- Do not implement PM structure only for cloud; changes must span the entire product stack.
- Pursue a skunkworks proposal to socialize with Jeff (and likely Sahar) first, presented jointly.

## Key Information
- Current PM practice lacks OKR/KR rigor and end-to-end traceability from tasks to strategy, making status checks and customer responses largely manual.
- Engineering work needed for cloud success depends heavily on core product changes; cloud and core teams have misaligned processes and limited workflow overlap.
- Leadership resistance is a key constraint: Jeff values revenue/flexibility over PM mechanics; Renan is resistant to traditional PM authority; Shahar prefers ambiguity that enables shifting priorities.
- Poor ticket/epic structure and shifting release commitments (example: MD migrate moving across releases) undermine accountability and delivery predictability.
- Jason reports limited traction with Jeff so far; Jeff prefers Jason to wait before proposing structural changes.
