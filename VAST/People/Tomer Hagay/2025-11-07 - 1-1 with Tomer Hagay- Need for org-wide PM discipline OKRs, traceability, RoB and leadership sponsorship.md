# 1:1 with Tomer Hagay: Need for org-wide PM discipline (OKRs, traceability, RoB) and leadership sponsorship

**Date**: 2025-11-07
**With**: Jason Vallery, Tomer Hagay

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Tomer Hagay aligned that VAST Data needs clearer product management discipline, including OKR/KR rigor, traceability from epics to tasks, and a defined rhythm of business for reporting. Tomer described leadership and cultural constraints that block adoption without top-down sponsorship, and both agreed to wait until the Tel Aviv onsite before drafting a concise proposal to socialize jointly with Jeff Denworth and likely Sahar.


## Action Items


- [?] Draft an outline for a VAST Data product management framework (scope, accountability gates, rhythm of business cadence, OKR/KR mapping) to socialize with Jeff Denworth and Sahar after the Tel Aviv onsite. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Map current cloud-to-core workflow interfaces and handoffs so any product management process spans the full product stack (cloud and core). @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule a joint review with Jeff Denworth and invite Sahar to discuss the proposed product management discipline after the Tel Aviv onsite. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Compile concrete examples of pain caused by missing epic and ticket structure (for example, inability to answer field questions on feature status) to support the proposal for product management discipline. @Tomer Hagay 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Meet in person in Tel Aviv to observe current processes and align on the approach for a product management discipline proposal. @Myself 📅 2025-11-10 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Reconnect after the Tel Aviv onsite to finalize proposal scope and the leadership presentation plan for Jeff Denworth and Sahar. @Tomer Hagay 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Defer drafting and socializing a product management discipline proposal until after the Tel Aviv onsite the following week, to gather context and align in person.

- Any product management operating model changes (OKRs, traceability, cadence) should be applied across the full product stack, not only the cloud area, because cloud delivery depends on core product engineering.




## Key Information


- Jason Vallery observed that product management at VAST Data is run very differently than at Microsoft, and he is still determining how much to insert himself into changing PM practices.

- Jason Vallery described a Microsoft-style PM operating model: durable objectives, measurable key results, monthly rhythm of business reviews, and hierarchical traceability from dev tasks to features to epics/user stories to KRs to objectives.

- Tomer Hagay said he had a vision for more structured PM at VAST Data (hierarchy of tasks and goals with measurable outcomes) but believes the organization is not currently capable of operating in that mode without leadership prioritization.

- Tomer Hagay stated that Renan is resistant to traditional product management authority and does not want sales to say they will prioritize with product management, asserting that customers are the product management function.

- Tomer Hagay reported that VAST Data lacks structured visibility into feature delivery status (epics and tickets), forcing manual status gathering by contacting engineers, which slows responses to field and customer questions.

- Jason Vallery asserted that implementing PM rigor requires top-down alignment and a two-in-a-box model with engineering leadership and product strategy leadership aligned, and cannot be driven bottom-up by Tomer Hagay alone.
