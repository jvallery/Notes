## Key Facts

- MVP launch on GCP uses private offers with fixed capacity pricing ($0.07/GB) via GCP Marketplace.
- Tackle.io is the middleware to generate private offers and sync them with Salesforce opportunities.
- Polaris is the source of truth for entitlements and metering; clusters call home to Polaris and enforce entitlements via tokens (no license keys).
- No BYOL for MVP; all transactions go through marketplaces to support hyperscaler partner status and MDF/marketing benefits.
- Considering ~10% overage allowance; goal is to charge overage at list PAYGO, but GCP Marketplace may not support this natively.
- Internal CS/sales alerting for entitlement usage/overage is not yet in place; customer alert exists.
- First GCP transactions targeted for Nov–Dec 2025; plan to replicate approach to AWS/Azure afterward.
- Finance will not have a separate cloud P&L; cloud metrics will be reported within overall P&L; SaaS/consumption metrics and forecasting model must be defined before full SaaS launch.
- Andy’s team operates across four pillars: field escalation/POC support, lab management/benchmarks, SE enablement/training plus PM augmentation, and marketing support.
- Documentation is currently feature/button-oriented and not scenario-driven; scenario guides are ad hoc and late.

GCP Marketplace MVP launch scope (private offers, fixed capacity, no BYOL), Tackle.io integration with Salesforce for private offers, Polaris entitlements, metering, call-home, and Uplink registration automation, Overage policy and GCP marketplace limitations; PAYGO overage workaround, EULA language requirements for overage billing, Finance processes: billing, payout cadence, reconciliation, reporting controls, rev rec, Future pricing model: VAST units of measurement for compute/capacity, Hybrid on-prem/cloud conversion and revenue recognition complexity, Multi-cloud pooling feasibility and hyperscaler positioning concerns, Need for cloud customer success coverage and internal usage alerting, Roles and responsibilities between PM and Field CTO org, Documentation and field training ownership gaps, Release process: phase gates, implementation reviews, FRDs/Confluence, Hands-on enablement: OVA, SE Lab, GitLab access, VAST on Cloud viability and cloud economics

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Transact exclusively through cloud marketplaces for MVP (no BYOL).
- ✅ Use Tackle.io to generate and manage private offers integrated with Salesforce.
- ✅ MVP pricing based on fixed capacity at $0.07/GB.
- ✅ Polaris will manage entitlement, call-home registration, and usage reporting.
- ✅ Use Phil Wagstrom as primary multi-tenancy SME contact.
- ✅ Proceed with OVA and SE Lab access for Jason’s learning.
- ✅ Schedule a follow-up focused on OpenAI architecture and needs.
- ✅ Carl will move to ProServe under Rob rather than supporting customer-facing PM work.
- ✅ Set a monthly touchpoint with Brandon to align on cloud platform priorities.
- ✅ Customer requirement docs and FRDs will be authored and maintained in Confluence.
