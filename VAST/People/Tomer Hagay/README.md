## Profile

**Role**: Product leader / PM (implied; counterpart in 1:1) at VAST (Tel Aviv team)
**Location**: Tel Aviv
**Relationship**: Engineering collaborator for 5.5 design alignment

**Background**:
- Involved in aligning on write-lease design and read redirection behaviors for the 5.5 release.
- Discussed constraints and leadership dynamics impacting adoption of formal product management discipline; provided concrete pain points/examples to support a proposal.

## Key Facts

- VAST currently lacks OKR/KR rigor and end-to-end traceability from tasks to strategy.
- Engineering effort for cloud success depends heavily on core product changes; PM process must cover the whole stack.
- Jeff is cautious about structural change and prefers Jason to learn the org before proposing changes.
- Renan resists traditional PM authority/ownership.
- Shahar prefers ambiguity and resists strict structure and gating.
- Cloud and core teams have misaligned processes and limited workflow overlap.
- Poor ticket/epic structure reduces delivery visibility and makes it hard to answer customer/status questions (example: MD migrate release movement).
- Any PM framework must be top-down endorsed by Jeff and Sahar to succeed.
- Tomer Hagey needed FRD templates/examples shared for Jason’s review.
- Tomer Hagey needed access to PM SFDC RFE/Feature dashboards and Jira links.
