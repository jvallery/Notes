# Tomer Hagay

## Key Facts

- Tomer Hagay's team triages Sales Engineering feature requests submitted in Salesforce and runs bi-weekly reviews of top requests with Jonathan Hayes.

- Tomer Hagay owned the action to ask Shachar Feinblit to confirm VAST's AI-first development mandate, training cadence, and measurable adoption targets.

- Tomer Hagay led the internal working session on aligning VAST cloud pricing with the new on-prem pricing model and shared the pricing spreadsheet previously reviewed on Thursday of the prior week.

- Tomer Hagay investigated Azure Compute Unit and other cross-generation normalization metrics for potential future use in cloud pricing normalization.

- Tomer Hagay owns measuring TPS per node to metadata and blob services and extrapolating scalability to 10,000 to 100,000 node clusters.

- A biweekly Tomer Hagay to Octo and field sync exists, and Jason Vallery was added to the OctoPM Monday sync.

- Field feature requests are triaged by Tomer Hagay’s team; Jonathan Hayes was assigned to review requests, and they run bi-weekly reviews of the top requests.

- Vishnu Charan TJ planned to sync with Tomer Hagay to learn outcomes of the prior week’s distributed caching meeting.

- VAST Data RFE triage is led by Jonathan Hayes, and Salesforce 'features' aggregate multiple RFEs and sync to Jira using a fixed-version linkage.

- Tomer Hagay observed that a subset of highly capable VAST Data engineers adopted AI coding tools quickly, while most engineers had not adopted them as of roughly two months prior to 2025-10-24; there was no clear adoption target metric communicated.

- An engineering leader named Albert (last name unknown) leads platform management plus UI/UX and API components at VAST Data, and described a group of 'go-to' engineers who know the stack broadly and became more efficient with AI tools.

- Tomer Hagay was cited as an example of product management sourcing customer needs and maintaining a list of desired features for upcoming VAST Data releases (example discussed: 5.6 content planning).

- A prior attempt to run a classic PM-led model at VAST Data (led by a predecessor named David, now a VP at Dell) was ineffective due to founder-driven decision changes and frequent last-minute reversals.

- Tomer Hagay believes cloud is a new area of serious investment at VAST Data and represents an opportunity to implement a more standard PM-led model that reduces friction between PM and architecture/engineering.

- Tomer Hagay previously envisioned a more structured product management model at VAST Data with hierarchy of tasks and goals and measurable outcomes, but believes the organization is not currently capable of operating in that mode without top-down prioritization.

- Tomer Hagay stated that Renan is resistant to traditional product management authority and does not want sales to say they will prioritize with product management, expressing a view that customers are the product management function.

- Tomer Hagay reported that answering basic field questions about feature status is largely manual at VAST Data because there is no consistent structure linking epics and tickets to delivery status, requiring direct outreach to engineers to assemble updates.

- Tomer Hagay provided Jason Vallery with FRD templates/examples for review.

- Tomer Hagay provided Jason Vallery access to PM Salesforce RFE/feature dashboards and shared related Jira links.

- Jason Vallery planned to establish a weekly or monthly 1:1 cadence with Tomer Hagay for coordination on cloud-related work.

- Tomer Hagay was identified as a coordination point for making Confluence the canonical home for FRDs and customer requirements.

- Tomer Hagay owns defining the overage policy (thresholds, grace, pricing) for the GCP Marketplace MVP and defining VAST units of measurement for compute and capacity for future pricing models.

## Topics

- Codifying AI-first software development workflows at VAST Data (training cadence, PR and review practices, measurable adoption targets)

- Release discipline and accountability improvements to reduce chronic schedule slips (example: VAST 5.4 slip June 2025 to October 2025)

- RFE intake and prioritization flow from Salesforce to Features to Jira, and inconsistent use of Epics

- Customer support operating model (Tier-3 co-pilots, per-customer Slack channels, vForce hotfix process)

- Global Namespace architecture (strict consistency, read leases, planned write leases, multi-protocol satellites, caching/prefetch)

- AI-enabled software development workflows and training programs (PR standards, audits, agent usage)

- VAST Data engineering process maturity, release slippage, and accountability

- Salesforce RFE to Jira to release lifecycle and prioritization mechanics

- Customer support model (Tier-3 Co-Pilots, customer Slack channels) and SaaS operations requirements

- Global Namespace architecture (strict consistency, lease-based caching, read leases and planned write leases)

- Shifting VAST cloud work to a PM-led operating model (definitions, architecture alignment, release planning)

- Current decision flow for roadmap and releases (Noah/Eyal funneling to Shahar)

- PM team capacity constraints (4 PMs for ~400 engineers) and impact on FRD ownership

- FRDs being solution-oriented vs problem-oriented and resulting friction

- Cloud design qualifiers checklist for FRDs (multi-tenancy, call-home/instrumentation, GUI analytics)

- Need for OKR/KR rigor and measurable outcomes in VAST Data product management

- Traceability from strategy objectives to KRs to epics/features/tasks for delivery accountability

- Rhythm of business (monthly business reviews) and reporting cadence for product execution

- Leadership resistance and cultural constraints to formal product management at VAST Data

- Manual status tracking and inability to answer field questions due to lack of structured epics/tickets

- FRD templates and examples for product requirements documentation

- Access to PM Salesforce RFE/feature request dashboards

- Jira linkage for feature request tracking
## Key Decisions

- Proceed with onboarding Jason Vallery to VAST Data OVA and Sales Engineering lab access so he can evaluate Global Namespace capabilities and development workflows firsthand.

- Hold a follow-up 1:1 meeting the following week to continue alignment on cloud prioritization and engineering process improvements.

- Schedule a Friday follow-up meeting to cover the cloud pricing model discussion and a Salesforce demo/walkthrough for feature and request tracking.

- Any product management discipline changes (OKRs/KRs, traceability, and rhythm of business) must be implemented org-wide across the full product stack, not only within the cloud organization, because cloud delivery depends on core product changes.

- Product management discipline will require explicit top-down sponsorship and enforcement from senior leadership (Jeff Denworth and Sahar, and alignment with engineering leadership including Renan) rather than being driven solely by Tomer Hagay or the PM team.
