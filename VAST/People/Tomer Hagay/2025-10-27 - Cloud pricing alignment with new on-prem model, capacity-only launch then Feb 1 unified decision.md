# Cloud pricing alignment with new on-prem model, capacity-only launch then Feb 1 unified decision

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Project**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Tomer Hagay, Jason Vallery, Yancey, Eric Wolfie, Lior Genzel, Eirikur Hrafnsson, Eric, Timo Pervane, Unknown Remote Speaker, Helen (Unknown)

## Summary

Internal team discussion on how to align VAST cloud pricing with a new on-prem core-plus-capacity model given hyperscaler instance core-density variance. The team agreed to launch cloud private offers with capacity-only pricing and tighter discount guidance, then decide by 2026-02-01 whether to introduce a commercial normalization (fixed cores per PB) or other tiering to keep cross-cloud parity.


## Action Items


- [?] Propose a cloud private-offer pricing structure and discount guidance using capacity-only pricing for immediate field use. @Tomer Hagay 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Forward the NBCU TCO working session invite to the core group (Jason Vallery, Lior Genzel, Eirikur Hrafnsson, Tomer Hagay, Eric Wolfie, Eric). @Yancey 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Join and support the NBCU TCO working session and align on inputs (reserved pricing, egress assumptions, and infrastructure COGS). @Eric 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Join the NBCU TCO working session and validate the pricing approach and competitive posture for VAST cloud private offers. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Add core stakeholders to the NBCU TCO sync invite. @Tomer Hagay 📅 2025-10-27 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Define and publish a cloud-specific discount policy for private offers to avoid extreme discounts and margin erosion. @TBD 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Complete the NBCU TCO analysis and share it with NBCU by Wednesday, 2025-10-29. @Eric 📅 2025-10-29 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Decide whether to introduce fixed cores-per-PB normalization for cloud pricing starting 2026-02-01 and document the chosen model. @TBD 📅 2026-02-01 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Define marketplace entitlements and pricing schema for a Google Cloud private offer and begin the approval process to avoid entitlement-change delays. @Yancey 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Plan and document a unified pricing rollout for 2026-02-01 that keeps on-prem and cloud pricing consistent, including how list price and discount guidance will be applied. @Tomer Hagay 📅 2026-02-01 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Develop a public PAYGO marketplace offer within approximately 6 months, including consumption metering and billing requirements for customer-tenant deployments. @TBD 📅 2026-04-27 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Plan a full multi-tenant SaaS offering (VAST-managed account model) and align pricing and COGS assumptions for a likely FY2028 timeframe. @TBD 📅 2028-06-30 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Deepen competitive cloud pricing analysis versus Pure, NetApp, Isilon, WEKA, and Hammerspace, including pricing models and reference price points. @TBD 📅 2025-11-10 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Evaluate feasibility and policy for an optional 'unlock all cores' add-on price in cloud while keeping the product behavior unchanged (no core disabling). @TBD 📅 2025-11-24 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Assess using performance tiers (instance class or throughput per PB) to simplify cloud pricing communication without synthetic core units. @TBD 📅 2025-11-24 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Investigate Azure Compute Unit or other cross-generation normalization metrics as potential future inputs to cloud pricing normalization. @Tomer Hagay 📅 2025-11-24 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Define hybrid ELA conversion and deployment tracking across on-prem and cloud in Polaris/Uplink to support marketplace burn-down and entitlement management. @TBD 📅 2025-12-15 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Launch VAST cloud private offers using capacity-only pricing (no core-based charge) as the near-term model.

- Do not implement engineering changes to disable or rate-limit excess vCPUs in cloud instances; any core normalization must be commercial, not technical.

- Target 2026-02-01 as the decision point for a broader unified pricing rollout aligning on-prem and cloud (including deciding whether to adopt fixed cores-per-PB normalization or another approach).

- Proceed with marketplace private offers across AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI before launching public offers.




## Key Information


- Jason Vallery stated his first day at VAST Data was Monday, 2025-10-20, and he is based in the Boston area.

- Tomer Hagay explained that VAST Data is changing the on-prem price list by lowering capacity list price, lowering core list price, and reducing discount levels, and that the model was validated against historical opportunity/deal data for the broader VAST business.

- Tomer Hagay highlighted that hyperscaler instance core density (vCPU-to-core normalized) varies widely, which makes a core-based cloud pricing model produce materially different $/TB across clouds (example range cited roughly $41/TB to $80/TB depending on instance family such as Azure LSv4 vs AWS i3en).

- Tomer Hagay and Eric Wolfie discussed a commercial normalization approach for cloud pricing: charge a fixed, normalized number of cores per petabyte (example used 200 cores/PB) regardless of the actual instance vCPU count, to preserve cross-cloud parity and align with the on-prem core-plus-capacity model.

- The meeting summary states the team agreed to launch cloud with capacity-only pricing for private offers, provide stricter cloud discount guidance to the field, and target a unified pricing model decision by 2026-02-01.

- The meeting summary states the team rejected implementing technical controls to disable or rate-limit excess vCPUs, preferring any normalization to be commercial rather than engineering-enforced.

- The meeting summary states a three-phase cloud GTM was reaffirmed: marketplace private offers in customer tenants first, public PAYGO offers targeted in approximately 6 months, and a full multi-tenant SaaS offering likely in FY2028.

- The meeting summary states cloud infrastructure COGS for NVMe-based VMs is high (approximately $0.15 to $0.30 per GB per month), implying early cloud use cases are primarily burst-oriented.

- The meeting summary states an initial market reference list price for cloud capacity is approximately $0.07 per GB per month, and the on-prem list rework target is approximately $13 per TB with a core component.
