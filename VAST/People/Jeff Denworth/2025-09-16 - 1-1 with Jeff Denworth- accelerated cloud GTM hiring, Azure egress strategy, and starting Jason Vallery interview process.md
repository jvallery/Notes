## Decisions


- Jeff Denworth and Jason Vallery agreed to start VAST Data's interview and recruiting process for Jason Vallery.

- Jeff Denworth and Jason Vallery aligned that the initial role focus should be Azure go-to-market leadership that is business-facing and paired with a highly technical counterpart.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth is ramping VAST Data's cloud go-to-market team from a single-person effort to a 10 to 15 person team because VAST Data has decided to make cloud a top priority and believes product-market feasibility is proven.

- Jeff Denworth described a target operating model of a 3-person core team per cloud consisting of a sales specialist, a business development lead, and a technical lead.

- Jason Vallery has approximately 13 years at Microsoft Azure and previously spent about 10 years as a software developer before moving into customer-facing roles.

- Jason Vallery worked in Azure Storage across capacity planning, feature roadmap, development priorities, go-to-market strategy, and sales pursuits, and he stated Azure Storage has roughly 1,600 people across PM and engineering (excluding field and ancillary roles).

- Jason Vallery stated Microsoft culture is slow to execute and cited writing an AI storage at scale technical strategy paper about three years prior that did not move quickly through execution.

- Jason Vallery first met OpenAI in 2018 and said he led the Azure engagement with OpenAI full-time until recently, with multiple team members also dedicated full-time to OpenAI, and additionally supported Microsoft AI and other smaller AI labs.

- Jason Vallery stated the Microsoft and OpenAI relationship shifted from an engineering-to-engineering model to a more complex enterprise relationship as OpenAI scaled from about 30 employees to roughly 5,000 employees, creating more challenges between the companies.

- Jeff Denworth observed that product messaging can reduce sales confidence when product leaders discuss advanced cloud integrations that are not yet delivered, and he intervened on an internal call to keep messaging aligned to current integration maturity.
