# Jeff Denworth escalation on MAI supply chain risk and need for immediate plan

**Date**: 2025-12-21
**With**: Jeff Denworth, Jason Vallery, Lior Genzel, Renen Hallak, Alon Horev, Shachar Feinblit, Jonsi Stefansson, Rick Scurfield, Avery Pham, Manish Sah, Kushal Datta, Kanchan Mehrotra, Qingying Zhang

## Summary

Jeff Denworth escalated concerns that VAST supply chain capacity is selling out quickly and lead times are rising, with nothing reserved for Microsoft. He asked whether Microsoft expects to use VAST's supply chain and emphasized that if Microsoft wants an April to June 2026 deployment window, VAST needs a concrete plan immediately.


## Action Items


- [?] Provide Jeff Denworth a clear plan for whether Microsoft MAI is expected to use VAST Data supply chain and what actions are required now to support a potential April to June 2026 deployment window given no inventory is reserved for Microsoft. @Myself 📅 2025-12-22 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Send Jeff Denworth the most recent analysis referenced in the thread ("Jason, please DM me your most recent analysis"). @Myself 📅 2025-12-12 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Obtain introductions and establish communication with Microsoft MAI stakeholders Majid Mohammed (Mustafa chief of staff), Yunchao Gong (Kushal Datta's manager), and Karén Simonyan (chief scientist, Mustafa direct report). @Lior Genzel 📅 2025-12-31 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Alon Horev to identify the most strategic environment to run Anson (Qi) VAST proof of concept for 1,000 to 2,000 GPU scale testing (MAI/Vipin environment vs Nscale vs CoreWeave). @Lior Genzel 📅 2025-12-19 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Meet with Alon Horev next week (relative to 2025-12-08/2025-12-09 update) to discuss MAI solution design, per Kushal Datta request. @Kushal Datta 📅 2025-12-19 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Prepare analysis of working capital and opportunity cost for VAST Data versus Microsoft if Microsoft is buying 100 EB, as requested by Jeff Denworth. @Jeff Denworth 📅 2025-12-19 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Lior Genzel will take the lead on obtaining introductions to key Microsoft MAI stakeholders Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, and Karén Simonyan to improve alignment beyond Kushal Datta.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated that VAST Data is quickly selling out of supply chain capacity and that lead times are skyrocketing, with nothing reserved for Microsoft.

- Jeff Denworth stated that if Microsoft wants to deploy in April, May, or June 2026, VAST Data needs a plan immediately due to supply chain constraints.

- Jason Vallery reported hearing from multiple Azure stakeholders that the final decision for the MAI storage choice is Mustafa's.

- Jason Vallery reported hearing from multiple Azure stakeholders that Kushal Datta cannot be trusted in the MAI decision process.

- Jason Vallery stated he has no current relationship with Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, or Karén Simonyan and that VAST needs to establish communication and trust with them for MAI alignment.

- Jason Vallery stated that Lior Genzel will take the lead on getting introductions to Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, and Karén Simonyan at Microsoft.

- Lior Genzel reported that Anson (Qi) requested moving a VAST proof of concept into either the MAI/Vipin environment or other large GPU clusters (Nscale or CoreWeave) because their lab cluster lacks 1,000 to 2,000 GPUs needed for performance scale testing.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal Datta said MAI's initial GPU drop will arrive in February 2026 and that MAI needs a storage solution ready for a May to June 2026 timeframe, with January no longer a hard date.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal Datta stated MAI will decide on the storage deployment and told Manish Sah that Azure Blob does not make sense versus VAST for MAI requirements.

- Lior Genzel reported that Vamshi (Azure Blob product leader) communicated that Microsoft's decision is internal and expressed frustration with VAST's aggressive approach in highlighting Azure Blob deficiencies.

- Jeff Denworth stated that supply chain for the upcoming year is a complete disaster and asked whether VAST knows how to source Microsoft's stated requirement of 2 exabytes and when and from whom it needs to be ordered.

- Renen Hallak stated that Microsoft should have its own flash allocation with NAND manufacturers and that VAST efficiencies could reduce Microsoft's NAND needs and potentially allow use of Microsoft's excess allocation for other customers.

- Jeff Denworth stated that VAST should consider taking the whole Microsoft deal down in one shot with partial delivery milestones due to constrained inventory through 2026.
