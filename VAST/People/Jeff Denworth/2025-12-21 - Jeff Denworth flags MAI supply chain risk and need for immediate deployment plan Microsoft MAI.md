# Jeff Denworth flags MAI supply chain risk and need for immediate deployment plan (Microsoft MAI)

**Date**: 2025-12-21
**With**: Jeff Denworth, Jason Vallery, Lior Genzel, Renen Hallak, Alon Horev, Shachar Feinblit, Jonsi Stefansson, Rick Scurfield, Avery Pham, Manish Sah, Kushal Datta

## Summary

Jeff Denworth escalated that VAST is selling out of supply, lead times are increasing, and nothing is reserved for Microsoft MAI. He asked whether Microsoft expects to use VAST's supply chain and stressed that if Microsoft wants an April to June 2026 deployment window, VAST needs a concrete plan immediately.


## Action Items


- [?] Provide Jeff Denworth with Jason Vallery's most recent analysis related to the Microsoft MAI deal (requested via DM) to support working capital and opportunity cost evaluation for a potential 100 EB purchase. @Myself 📅 2025-12-22 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm whether Microsoft MAI expects to use VAST Data's supply chain for the deployment and communicate the answer to Jeff Denworth, including implications of no inventory reserved for Microsoft. @Myself 📅 2025-12-22 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Work with VAST Operations to track Microsoft MAI capacity requirements (referenced as 2 EB and potentially 100 EB) and determine ordering lead times and sourcing plan given 2026 supply constraints. @TBD 📅 2025-12-29 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule and prepare a meeting between Alon Horev and Microsoft MAI contact Kushal Datta to discuss solution design, as requested by Kushal Datta for the following week (relative to 2025-12-08/2025-12-09 updates). @Alon Horev 📅 2025-12-19 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Obtain introductions to Microsoft MAI stakeholders Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, and Karén Simonyan to build direct relationships beyond Kushal Datta. @Lior Genzel 📅 2025-12-31 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Decide the target environment for Anson (Qi)'s VAST proof of concept (MAI/Vipin environment vs Nscale vs CoreWeave) to enable 1,000 to 2,000 GPU scale testing and maintain momentum. @TBD 📅 2025-12-26 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Lior Genzel will take the lead on obtaining introductions to key Microsoft MAI stakeholders (Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, and Karén Simonyan) to reduce reliance on Kushal Datta as the sole conduit.

- VAST should prioritize selecting the most strategic environment for Anson (Qi)'s VAST proof of concept, potentially aligning it with the Microsoft MAI/Vipin environment or large GPU clusters such as Nscale or CoreWeave to enable 1,000 to 2,000 GPU scale testing.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated that VAST Data is quickly selling out of supply and lead times are increasing significantly, so VAST cannot assume it can fulfill large near-term deployments without immediate planning.

- Jeff Denworth stated that there is currently no inventory reserved for Microsoft for the MAI initiative, and any April to June 2026 deployment expectation requires a plan immediately.

- Lior Genzel reported that Microsoft MAI contact Kushal Datta said the initial GPU drop will arrive in February 2026 and MAI needs a storage solution ready for a May to June 2026 timeframe, and that January 2026 is no longer a hard date.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal Datta said MAI will decide on the storage deployment and told Manish Sah that Azure Blob does not make sense versus VAST for MAI requirements.

- Jason Vallery reported hearing from multiple Azure contacts that the final decision for MAI storage is Mustafa's and that Kushal Datta is not trusted by some stakeholders.

- Jason Vallery stated that VAST currently lacks relationships with key MAI stakeholders Majid Mohammed (Mustafa's chief of staff), Yunchao Gong (Kushal Datta's manager), and Karén Simonyan (Yunchao Gong's manager, chief scientist, direct report to Mustafa), and that Lior Genzel will lead getting introductions.

- Lior Genzel reported that Anson (Qi) requested moving his VAST proof of concept into either the MAI/Vipin environment or other large GPU clusters (Nscale or CoreWeave) because their lab cluster lacks the 1,000 to 2,000 GPUs needed for scale performance testing.

- Jeff Denworth stated that supply chain constraints are expected to be a major issue through 2026 and asked whether VAST knows how to source Microsoft's stated requirement (including references to 2 EB and potentially 100 EB) and when orders must be placed.

- Renen Hallak stated that Microsoft should have its own flash allocation with NAND manufacturers and that VAST efficiencies could reduce Microsoft's NAND needs and potentially allow use of Microsoft's excess allocation for other customers.

- Jeff Denworth requested that VAST track Microsoft's MAI requirement with VAST Operations and suggested taking the whole deal down in one transaction with partial delivery milestones due to constrained inventory.
