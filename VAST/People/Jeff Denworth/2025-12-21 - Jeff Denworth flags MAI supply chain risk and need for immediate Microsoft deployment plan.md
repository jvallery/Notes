# Jeff Denworth flags MAI supply chain risk and need for immediate Microsoft deployment plan

**Date**: 2025-12-21
**With**: Jeff Denworth, Jason Vallery, Lior Genzel, Renen Hallak, Alon Horev, Shachar Feinblit, Jonsi Stefansson, Rick Scurfield, Avery Pham, Kushal Datta, Maneesh Sah, Kanchan Mehrotra, Qingying Zhang

## Summary

Jeff Denworth raised urgent concerns about whether Microsoft MAI expects to use VAST's supply chain, noting VAST is selling out inventory and lead times are increasing. He emphasized that if Microsoft wants deployments in April through June 2026, VAST needs a plan immediately because nothing is reserved for Microsoft.


## Action Items


- [?] Provide Jeff Denworth a clear plan for how VAST Data will support Microsoft MAI deployments targeted for April 2026 through June 2026, including whether Microsoft would use VAST's supply chain and what inventory can be allocated. @Myself 📅 2025-12-22 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] DM Jeff Denworth the most recent analysis Jason Vallery has on the Microsoft MAI deal (context: working capital, opportunity cost, and/or supply chain implications). @Myself 📅 2025-12-12 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Obtain introductions and establish communication with Microsoft MAI stakeholders Majid Mohammed (Mustafa chief of staff), Yunchao Gong (Kushal Datta's manager), and Karén Simonyan (chief scientist reporting to Mustafa). @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-10 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Identify the most strategic environment to run Anson (Qi)'s VAST PoC for 1,000 to 2,000 GPU scale testing, choosing between Microsoft MAI/Vipin environment and third-party clusters (Nscale or CoreWeave). @Lior Genzel 📅 2025-12-19 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Alon Horev to evaluate options for Anson (Qi)'s PoC environment and to potentially merge Kushal Datta's MAI plans with Qi's PoC plans. @Lior Genzel 📅 2025-12-19 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Lior Genzel will take the lead on obtaining introductions to key Microsoft MAI stakeholders (Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, and Karén Simonyan) to build trust beyond Kushal Datta.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated VAST Data is quickly selling out of inventory and lead times are increasing, so there is no hardware reserved for Microsoft MAI unless a plan is made immediately.

- Jeff Denworth asked whether Microsoft MAI expects to use VAST Data's supply chain for the deployment, given constrained inventory and rising lead times.

- Jeff Denworth indicated that if Microsoft MAI wants to deploy in April 2026, May 2026, or June 2026, VAST Data needs a supply and execution plan immediately.

- Jason Vallery reported hearing from multiple Azure stakeholders that the final Microsoft MAI storage decision is made by a person named Mustafa (last name not provided in the email).

- Jason Vallery reported hearing from multiple Azure stakeholders that Kushal Datta cannot be trusted, and Jason is concerned Kushal may be misrepresenting VAST Data's status as the preferred solution.

- Jason Vallery stated he has no existing relationship with Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, or Karén Simonyan (Microsoft MAI stakeholders) and that Lior Genzel will lead efforts to get introductions.

- Lior Genzel stated there is no waiting time in the current MAI plan and VAST Data is positioned to accelerate the process.

- Lior Genzel reported that Anson (Qi) requested moving a VAST PoC into either the Microsoft MAI/Vipin environment or other clusters (Nscale or CoreWeave) because their lab cluster lacks 1,000 to 2,000 GPUs needed for scale performance testing.

- Jeff Denworth stated supply chain constraints are expected to be a major issue for the upcoming year and asked how VAST Data would source a 2 EB requirement for Microsoft MAI and when it must be ordered.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal Datta said Microsoft MAI's initial GPU drop will arrive in February 2026 and they need a storage solution ready for the May 2026 to June 2026 timeframe, and that January 2026 is no longer a hard date.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal Datta stated Microsoft MAI will decide on the storage deployment and told Maneesh Sah that Azure Blob does not make sense versus VAST Data for MAI requirements.

- Lior Genzel reported that Vamshi (Azure Blob product leader, last name not provided) communicated that Microsoft's decision is internal and expressed frustration with VAST Data's aggressive approach in highlighting Azure Blob deficiencies.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal Datta requested a meeting with Alon Horev the following week (relative to 2025-12-09) to discuss Microsoft MAI solution design.

- Jeff Denworth requested a summary of status by end of week (relative to 2025-12-12) and asked for analysis of working capital and opportunity cost if Microsoft is buying 100 EB.

- Jeff Denworth asked Jason Vallery to DM his most recent analysis related to the Microsoft MAI deal.

- Renen Hallak stated Microsoft should have its own flash allocation with NAND manufacturers and that VAST Data efficiencies could reduce Microsoft's NAND needs and potentially allow use of Microsoft's excess allocation for other customers.
