# Jeff Denworth update: Walmart hybrid requirements unsettled, need analysis and product plan input

**Date**: 2025-12-23
**With**: Jeff Denworth, Myself, Mikey

## Summary

Jeff Denworth shared that Walmart restated requirements after an internal meeting, emphasizing a long-term hybrid solution and rejection of two disjoint namespaces. Walmart plans an on-prem-only big data POC and requires integration with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), which may put Alluxio back in a leading position. Jeff asked PM management to analyze requirements with Mikey and team and drive a product plan path toward full estate takeover.


## Action Items


- [?] Analyze Walmart's restated requirements from their internal requirements meeting (hybrid long-term, unified namespace, on-prem-only POC, GCS integration requirement) and summarize gaps versus current VAST capabilities. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Mikey and the Walmart account team to determine which Walmart requirements should be incorporated into the VAST product plan and what near-term actions reduce Alluxio competitive risk. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Propose a concrete path and milestones (non-date commitments) toward 'total estate takeover' at Walmart, including how VAST would address unified namespace and GCS integration constraints. @Myself #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Walmart held an internal requirements meeting during the week of 2025-12-22 and restated that they need a long-term hybrid solution for their data team.

- Walmart was not successful in getting the business to accept two disjoint namespaces, indicating a requirement for a unified namespace approach.

- Walmart plans to start an internal big data proof of concept (POC) sometime in 2025, limited to workloads that can run exclusively on premises.

- Walmart requires any forward solution to integrate with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), or else requires significant database-layer lobbying including potentially a hybrid cloud database.

- Jeff Denworth warned that Walmart's requirements may put Alluxio back in the driver seat, creating competitive risk for VAST Data.

- Jeff Denworth delegated to VAST Data product management leadership to work with Mikey and team to analyze Walmart's restated requirements and determine what should enter the VAST product plan.
