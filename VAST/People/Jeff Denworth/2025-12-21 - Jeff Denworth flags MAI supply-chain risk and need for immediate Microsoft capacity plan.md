# Jeff Denworth flags MAI supply-chain risk and need for immediate Microsoft capacity plan

**Date**: 2025-12-21
**With**: Jeff Denworth, Jason Vallery, Lior Genzel, Renen Hallak, Alon Horev, Shachar Feinblit, Jonsi Stefansson, Rick Scurfield, Avery Pham, Manish Sah, Kushal Datta, Kanchan Mehrotra, Qingying Zhang

## Summary

Jeff Denworth asked whether Microsoft MAI expects to use VAST's supply chain and warned VAST is selling out with lead times rising, with nothing reserved for Microsoft. He emphasized that if Microsoft wants deployments in April to June 2026, VAST needs a concrete plan immediately and will discuss this with Jason Vallery the next day.


## Action Items


- [?] Provide Jeff Denworth with Jason Vallery's most recent analysis related to the Microsoft MAI opportunity (requested by Jeff on 2025-12-12). @Myself 📅 2025-12-22 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Work with VAST Operations to confirm whether any inventory or supply-chain capacity is reserved for Microsoft MAI and, if not, define a procurement and delivery plan that can support potential April-June 2026 deployments. @Myself 📅 2025-12-22 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Obtain introductions and establish direct communication with Microsoft MAI stakeholders Majid Mohammed (Mustafa's chief of staff), Yunchao Gong (Kushal Datta's manager), and Karén Simonyan (chief scientist) to reduce reliance on Kushal Datta as the sole conduit. @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-10 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Determine the most strategic environment to run Anson (Qi)'s VAST proof of concept at 1,000 to 2,000 GPU scale, evaluating Microsoft MAI/Vipin environment versus Nscale or CoreWeave clusters, and align this with Kushal Datta's MAI plan. @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-10 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Lior Genzel will lead efforts to obtain introductions to key Microsoft MAI stakeholders (Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, Karén Simonyan) to build trust beyond Kushal Datta.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated VAST Data is quickly selling out of inventory, lead times are skyrocketing, and there is currently nothing reserved for Microsoft for the MAI effort.

- Jeff Denworth asked whether Microsoft MAI expects to use VAST Data's supply chain for the MAI storage deployment.

- Jeff Denworth emphasized that if Microsoft MAI wants to deploy in April 2026, May 2026, or June 2026, VAST Data needs a plan immediately due to supply-chain constraints.

- Jason Vallery reported hearing from multiple Azure contacts that the final MAI storage decision is made by a person named Mustafa (Microsoft), and that Kushal Datta cannot be trusted.

- Jason Vallery stated he has no current relationship with Majid Mohammed (Mustafa's chief of staff at Microsoft), Yunchao Gong (Kushal Datta's manager at Microsoft), or Karén Simonyan (Yunchao Gong's manager and Microsoft MAI chief scientist).

- Jason Vallery stated Lior Genzel will take the lead on obtaining introductions to Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, and Karén Simonyan to build trust with additional Microsoft MAI stakeholders.

- Lior Genzel reported that a Microsoft contact named Anson (Qi) requested moving a VAST proof of concept into either the Microsoft MAI or Vipin environment, or into Nscale or CoreWeave clusters, because their lab cluster lacks 1,000 to 2,000 GPUs needed for scale performance testing.

- Lior Genzel stated he messaged Alon Horev to strategize options for the best environment to run Anson (Qi)'s VAST proof of concept and to potentially merge Kushal Datta's MAI plan with Qi's proof of concept plan.

- In a December 8, 2025 end-of-day update, Lior Genzel reported Kushal Datta said Microsoft MAI's initial GPU drop will arrive in February 2026 and they need a storage solution ready for the May 2026 to June 2026 timeframe, meaning January 2026 is no longer a hard date.

- Lior Genzel reported Kushal Datta stated Microsoft MAI will decide on the storage deployment and told Manish Sah that Azure Blob does not make sense compared to VAST for MAI requirements.

- Lior Genzel reported Vamshi (leader of the Azure Blob product at Microsoft) communicated that Microsoft's decision is internal and expressed frustration with VAST's aggressive approach in highlighting Azure Blob deficiencies.

- Lior Genzel reported Kushal Datta requested a meeting with Alon Horev the following week (week of December 15, 2025) to discuss MAI solution design.

- Jeff Denworth stated supply chain for storage is a disaster for the upcoming year and asked whether VAST knows how to source Microsoft's stated 2 exabytes requirement, when it must be ordered, and which supplier VAST would order from.

- Renen Hallak stated Microsoft should have its own flash allocation with NAND manufacturers and that VAST efficiencies could reduce Microsoft's NAND needs and potentially allow VAST to use Microsoft's excess allocation for other customers.
