# Walmart requirements reset: hybrid namespace and GCS integration risk

**Date**: 2025-12-23
**With**: Jeff Denworth, Myself, Mikey

## Summary

Jeff Denworth relayed that Walmart restated requirements after an internal meeting, emphasizing a long-term hybrid solution and rejection of two disjoint namespaces. Walmart plans an on-prem-only big data POC and requires integration with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), which may increase competitive risk from Alluxio; Jeff asked PM management to analyze requirements and feed product planning with Mikey and team.


## Action Items


- [?] Analyze Walmart's restated requirements from their internal requirements meeting and identify which requirements should be incorporated into the VAST product plan, coordinating with Mikey and team. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Create an account-level plan for Walmart that defines a clear path to "total estate takeover" (end-to-end platform adoption), including how VAST will address unified namespace and GCS integration requirements. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Walmart held an internal requirements meeting during the week of 2025-12-22 and restated that they need a long-term hybrid solution for their data team.

- Walmart was not successful in getting the business to accept two disjoint namespaces, implying a requirement for a unified namespace across environments.

- Walmart plans to start an internal big data proof of concept (POC) sometime in 2025, limited to workloads that can run exclusively on premises.

- Walmart requires integration with Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for any solution they move forward with, or would need significant lobbying at the database layer including a hybrid cloud database.

- Jeff Denworth warned that Walmart's GCS integration requirement could put Alluxio back in a leading position for the account and advised VAST to be careful.

- Jeff Denworth asked PM management to analyze Walmart's restated requirements and determine what should be included in the VAST product plan, working with Mikey and team.
