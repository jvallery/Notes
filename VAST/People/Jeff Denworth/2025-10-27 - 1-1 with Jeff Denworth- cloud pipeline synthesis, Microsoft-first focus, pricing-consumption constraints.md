# 1:1 with Jeff Denworth: cloud pipeline synthesis, Microsoft-first focus, pricing/consumption constraints

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jeff Denworth

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Jeff Denworth aligned on near-term priorities: build a synthesized cloud pipeline and requirements view across major hyperscalers, prioritize Microsoft, and develop a Google TPU strategy in parallel. They agreed not to run an OpenAI alignment session until OpenAI actively engages, and they surfaced key risks around broad consumption pricing, especially for on-prem where utilization is low and prepaid revenue is at risk.


## Action Items


- [?] Draft a pricing and consumption model write-up capturing constraints (unit of billing vs customer commitment, PAYGO vs reserved commit, and on-prem prepaid risk) and share first with Jeff Denworth and Yancey. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule a cloud alignment working session (whiteboard day) with Jeff Denworth and Yancey to align on cloud product strategy, workload characteristics, cloud primitives, and sales constraints. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Do not run an OpenAI alignment session until OpenAI actively engages and commits to the work.

- Run a cloud alignment working session focused on product strategy against cloud primitives, workload characteristics, and sales constraints, led by Jason Vallery, Jeff Denworth, and Yancey (with others optional).

- Pricing/consumption model discussion should separate the unit of billing (metering) from the customer commitment model (reserved commit vs PAYGO), and should avoid broad on-prem consumption that would undermine prepaid revenue.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated that an OpenAI alignment session is not useful until OpenAI actively engages and commits, because VAST will not do meaningful work until the customer engages.

- Jeff Denworth stated that Lior Genzel has limited influence on product strategy because Lior is primarily a seller responsible for setting meetings and driving conversations, while product strategy should be driven by Jason Vallery and Yancey.

- Jeff Denworth stated that broad consumption pricing across both cloud and on-prem could significantly harm VAST's business because on-prem clusters are approximately 30% utilized on average, which would reduce prepaid revenue and force difficult customer conversations about on-prem deployments.

- Jeff Denworth stated that a uniform pricing model across cloud and on-prem has advantages because it allows customers to commit to VAST regardless of deployment location, improving commercial simplicity.

- Jason Vallery proposed a full-day cloud alignment working session (whiteboard day) with Jeff Denworth and Yancey to align on cloud product strategy, workload characteristics, cloud primitives, and sales constraints, and to avoid stepping on historical context and existing conversations.

- Jason Vallery committed to writing up thoughts from a prior pricing conversation and sharing the write-up with Jeff Denworth and Yancey first, then broadening distribution if appropriate.
