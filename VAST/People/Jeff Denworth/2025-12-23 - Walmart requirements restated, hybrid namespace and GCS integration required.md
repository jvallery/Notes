# Walmart requirements restated, hybrid namespace and GCS integration required

**Date**: 2025-12-23
**With**: Jeff Denworth, Myself, Mikey

## Summary

Jeff Denworth relayed outcomes from Walmart's internal requirements meeting: Walmart still needs a long-term hybrid solution and the business rejected operating with two disjoint namespaces. Walmart plans an internal big data POC limited to on-prem-only workloads, and any forward path requires integration with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), which may increase Alluxio's competitiveness.


## Action Items


- [?] Analyze Walmart's restated requirements from their internal requirements meeting (hybrid solution, unified namespace, GCS integration) and propose what changes should be incorporated into the VAST product plan. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Mikey and relevant team members to validate Walmart's requirements (unified namespace and GCS integration) and define a path to win the full Walmart data estate. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Assess competitive positioning and risk from Alluxio given Walmart's hybrid namespace and GCS integration requirements, and recommend mitigation actions for VAST. @Myself #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Walmart held an internal requirements meeting during the week of 2025-12-22 and restated that they need a long-term hybrid solution for their data team.

- Walmart was not successful in getting the business to accept operating with two disjoint namespaces, indicating a requirement for a unified namespace across environments.

- Walmart plans to start an internal big data proof of concept (POC) sometime in 2026, limited to workloads that can run exclusively on premises.

- Walmart requires integration with Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for any solution they move forward with, or alternatively would need significant lobbying at the database layer including a hybrid cloud database.

- Jeff Denworth warned that Walmart's requirements could put Alluxio back in the driver seat competitively, and VAST should be careful.

- Jeff Denworth asked VAST product management leadership to analyze Walmart's restated requirements and determine what should be incorporated into the VAST product plan, working with Mikey and team.
