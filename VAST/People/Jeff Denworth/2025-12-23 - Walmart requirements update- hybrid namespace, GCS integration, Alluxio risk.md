# Walmart requirements update: hybrid namespace, GCS integration, Alluxio risk

**Date**: 2025-12-23
**With**: Jeff Denworth, Myself, Mikey

## Summary

Jeff Denworth relayed that Walmart re-stated requirements for a long-term hybrid data solution and rejected operating with two disjoint namespaces. Walmart plans an internal big data POC limited to on-prem-only workloads and requires integration with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), which may put Alluxio back in a leading position. Jeff asked PM management to analyze the requirements and determine what should enter the VAST product plan, with a goal of a clear path to full estate takeover.


## Action Items


- [?] Analyze Walmart's re-stated requirements (hybrid solution, unified namespace, GCS integration) and propose what should be added to the VAST cloud and hybrid product plan. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Mikey and relevant team members to validate Walmart POC scope (on-prem-only workloads) and identify a path for VAST to win the full Walmart data estate over time. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Assess Alluxio competitive positioning for Walmart's hybrid + GCS integration requirements and identify mitigation actions for VAST (product gaps, messaging, partner strategy). @Myself #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- PM management will own analyzing Walmart's re-stated requirements and determining what should be incorporated into the VAST product plan, working with Mikey and team.




## Key Information


- Walmart stated they still need to build a long-term hybrid solution for their data team.

- Walmart was not successful in getting the business to accept operating with two disjoint namespaces.

- Walmart plans to start an internal big data proof of concept (POC) sometime in 2025, limited to workloads that can exclusively run on premises.

- Walmart indicated any solution they move forward with will require integration with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), or significant lobbying at the database layer including potentially a hybrid cloud database.

- Jeff Denworth warned that Walmart's requirements may put Alluxio back in the driver seat and that VAST should be careful.
