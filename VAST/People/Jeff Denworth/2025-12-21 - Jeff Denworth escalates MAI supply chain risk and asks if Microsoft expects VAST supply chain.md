# Jeff Denworth escalates MAI supply chain risk and asks if Microsoft expects VAST supply chain

**Date**: 2025-12-21
**With**: Jeff Denworth, Jason Vallery, Lior Genzel, Renen Hallak, Alon Horev, Shachar Feinblit, Jonsi Stefansson, Rick Scurfield, Maneesh Sah, Kushal Datta

## Summary

Jeff Denworth raised a critical concern that VAST is selling out of inventory, lead times are increasing, and nothing is reserved for Microsoft. He asked whether Microsoft MAI expects to use VAST's supply chain and emphasized that if Microsoft wants an April to June 2026 deployment, VAST needs a plan immediately.


## Action Items


- [?] Answer Jeff Denworth's question on whether Microsoft MAI expects to use VAST Data's supply chain for the MAI storage deployment, and propose an immediate plan to address April 2026 to June 2026 deployment timing given no inventory is reserved for Microsoft. @Myself 📅 2025-12-22 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Send Jeff Denworth the most recent analysis Jason Vallery has on the Microsoft MAI deal, including any assumptions around 100 EB and 2 EB sourcing implications. @Myself 📅 2025-12-22 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Work with Lior Genzel to secure introductions to Microsoft MAI stakeholders Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, and Karén Simonyan to reduce reliance on Kushal Datta as the sole channel to the decision maker Mustafa. @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-10 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Alon Horev and Lior Genzel to decide the most strategic environment to run Anson (Qi)'s VAST proof of concept that requires 1,000 to 2,000 GPUs, evaluating MAI and Vipin environment versus Nscale or CoreWeave clusters. @Alon Horev 📅 2025-12-19 #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated that VAST Data is quickly selling out of inventory and lead times are skyrocketing, so there is currently nothing reserved for Microsoft MAI.

- Jeff Denworth asked whether Microsoft MAI expects to use VAST Data's supply chain for the MAI storage deployment.

- Jeff Denworth emphasized that if Microsoft MAI wants to deploy in April 2026, May 2026, or June 2026, VAST Data needs a supply and execution plan immediately due to supply chain constraints.

- Jason Vallery reported hearing from multiple Azure contacts that the final MAI storage decision is Mustafa's and that Kushal Datta cannot be trusted.

- Jason Vallery stated that Kushal Datta told VAST in a face-to-face meeting that he would influence Mustafa's decision and that VAST is the preferred solution, but Jason Vallery is concerned Kushal Datta may not be honest and may be 'playing' VAST.

- Jason Vallery identified key Microsoft MAI stakeholders VAST needs relationships with: Majid Mohammed (Mustafa's chief of staff), Yunchao Gong (Kushal Datta's boss), and Karén Simonyan (Yunchao Gong's boss, chief scientist, direct report of Mustafa).

- Jason Vallery stated he has no current relationship with Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, or Karén Simonyan, and that Lior Genzel will take the lead on getting introductions.

- Lior Genzel reported that Anson (Qi) requested moving his VAST proof of concept into either the MAI and Vipin environment or other Nscale or CoreWeave clusters because their lab cluster lacks 1,000 to 2,000 GPUs needed for performance scale testing.

- Lior Genzel said he messaged Alon Horev to strategize options for the most strategic environment to run Anson (Qi)'s VAST proof of concept and suggested meshing Kushal Datta's MAI plans with Qi's proof of concept plans.

- Lior Genzel stated there is no waiting time in the current plan and VAST is positioned to accelerate the MAI engagement process.

- Jeff Denworth stated that supply chain for the upcoming year is a complete disaster and asked whether VAST knows how to source Microsoft's stated 2 EB requirement, when it needs to be ordered, and who VAST would order it from.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal Datta said January is no longer a hard date, that MAI's initial GPU drop will arrive in February, and that MAI needs a storage solution ready for the May 2026 to June 2026 timeframe.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal Datta said MAI will decide on the storage deployment and told Maneesh Sah that Azure Blob does not make sense compared to VAST for MAI requirements.

- Lior Genzel reported that Vamshi (Azure Blob product leader) communicated that Microsoft's decision is internal and expressed frustration with VAST's aggressive approach in highlighting Azure Blob deficiencies.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal Datta wanted to meet with Alon Horev the following week to discuss MAI solution design.

- Jeff Denworth requested that Jason Vallery send him Jason's most recent analysis via direct message related to the MAI deal and potential 100 EB purchase.

- Jeff Denworth stated that if Microsoft is really buying 100 EB, he wants to analyze working capital and opportunity cost for VAST Data versus Microsoft.
