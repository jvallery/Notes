# Jeff Denworth escalation on MAI supply chain risk and need for immediate deployment plan

**Date**: 2025-12-21
**With**: Jeff Denworth, Jason Vallery, Lior Genzel, Renen Hallak, Alon Horev, Shachar Fienblit, Avery Pham, Jonsi Stephenson, Rick Scurfield, Anson (Qi), Kushal (last name unknown), Mustafa (last name unknown), Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, Karén Simonyan, Vamshi (last name unknown), Manish (likely Maneesh Sah), Sagar (last name unknown), Nidhi (last name unknown), Vipin (last name unknown)

## Summary

Jeff Denworth escalated that VAST is selling out of supply and lead times are rising, so any Microsoft MAI deployment in April to June 2026 requires an immediate sourcing and execution plan with nothing currently reserved for Microsoft. The thread also captures internal MAI decision dynamics, including that Mustafa is the final decision maker and that VAST needs trusted relationships with additional MAI stakeholders beyond Kushal.


## Action Items


- [?] Send Jeff Denworth the most recent analysis requested in the thread (context: Microsoft MAI deal and supply chain/working capital implications). @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Work with VAST Operations to confirm whether Microsoft MAI requirements are being tracked and to determine sourcing and ordering plan for the stated 2 EB near-term requirement and potential 100 EB total deal size. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Lior Genzel to ensure introductions are pursued to Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, and Karén Simonyan (Microsoft MAI) to reduce reliance on Kushal as the sole conduit to Mustafa. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Decide the most strategic environment to run Anson (Qi)'s VAST PoC for 1,000 to 2,000 GPU scale testing (MAI and Vipin environment vs Nscale vs CoreWeave) and align with Alon Horev and Lior Genzel. @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Prepare analysis of working capital and opportunity cost for VAST vs Microsoft if Microsoft is buying 100 EB, as requested by Jeff Denworth. @TBD #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Lior Genzel to share an end-of-day summary of status and next steps for the Microsoft MAI engagement (including Jason Vallery feedback). @Lior Genzel #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Lior Genzel will take the lead on obtaining introductions to key Microsoft MAI stakeholders Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, and Karén Simonyan to build trust beyond Kushal.

- VAST should not assume any Microsoft MAI inventory is reserved and must create an immediate supply chain and ordering plan if Microsoft targets April 2026 to June 2026 deployment.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated that VAST Data is quickly selling out of supply and lead times are skyrocketing, so VAST cannot assume it can deliver a Microsoft MAI deployment without an immediate sourcing plan and without any inventory reserved for Microsoft.

- Jeff Denworth stated that if Microsoft MAI wants to deploy in April 2026, May 2026, or June 2026, VAST needs a plan immediately because nothing is reserved for Microsoft.

- Jason Vallery reported hearing from multiple Azure contacts that the final decision for the MAI storage direction is made by Mustafa (last name unknown).

- Jason Vallery reported hearing from multiple Azure contacts that Kushal (last name unknown) cannot be trusted, and Jason is concerned Kushal may be misrepresenting VAST's preferred status to influence Mustafa.

- Jason Vallery stated he has no current relationship with Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, or Karén Simonyan, and that Lior Genzel will lead getting introductions to them to build trust with MAI stakeholders.

- Lior Genzel stated that Anson (Qi) requested moving his VAST proof of concept into either the MAI and Vipin environment or other Nscale or CoreWeave clusters because their lab cluster lacks 1,000 to 2,000 GPUs needed for performance scale testing.

- Lior Genzel stated he messaged Alon Horev to strategize options for the most strategic environment to run Anson (Qi)'s VAST proof of concept and to potentially merge Kushal's MAI plans with Qi's PoC plans.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal said MAI's initial GPU drop will arrive in February 2026 and MAI needs a storage solution ready for the May 2026 to June 2026 timeframe, and that January 2026 is no longer a hard date.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal said MAI will decide on the storage deployment and that Kushal told Manish that Azure Blob compared to VAST does not make sense for MAI requirements.

- Lior Genzel reported that Vamshi (Azure Blob product leader) emphasized Microsoft's decision is internal and expressed frustration with VAST's aggressive approach in highlighting Azure Blob deficiencies.

- Jeff Denworth stated that supply chain constraints are expected through 2026 and suggested taking the whole Microsoft MAI deal down in one shot with partial delivery milestones.

- Renen Hallak stated that Microsoft should have its own flash allocation with NAND manufacturers and that VAST efficiencies could reduce Microsoft's NAND needs and potentially allow Microsoft to reallocate excess NAND to other customers.

- Jeff Denworth stated that VAST should capitalize on a 'disastrous configuration' at Nscale and asked whether CoreWeave's situation is the same or worse.

- Jeff Denworth asked whether VAST is tracking Microsoft's MAI requirements with VAST Operations and whether VAST can deliver within the tight timeframe.
