# Walmart restates hybrid requirements, rejects disjoint namespaces, GCS integration required

**Date**: 2025-12-23
**With**: Jeff Denworth, Myself, Mikey

## Summary

Jeff Denworth relayed that Walmart restated requirements after an internal meeting: they need a long-term hybrid solution and the business rejected operating with two disjoint namespaces. Walmart plans an internal big data POC limited to on-prem-only workloads, and any forward path requires integration with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), which may increase Alluxio competitiveness. Jeff asked PM management to analyze the updated requirements with Mikey's team and drive a product plan path toward full estate adoption.


## Action Items


- [?] Analyze Walmart's restated requirements from the 2025-12-22 week internal requirements meeting and identify which requirements should be incorporated into the VAST product plan for Walmart hybrid and unified namespace needs. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Mikey and team to review Walmart's requirement for Google Cloud Storage (GCS) integration and propose a VAST approach that reduces Alluxio competitive risk and supports a path to full estate adoption at Walmart. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Walmart held an internal requirements meeting during the week of 2025-12-22 and restated that they need a long-term hybrid solution for their data team.

- Walmart was not successful in getting the business to accept operating with two disjoint namespaces, indicating a requirement for a unified namespace across environments.

- Walmart plans to start an internal big data proof of concept (POC) sometime in 2026, but only for workloads that can exclusively run on premises.

- Walmart requires integration with Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for any solution they move forward with, or would need significant lobbying at the database layer including potentially adopting a hybrid cloud database.

- Jeff Denworth warned that Walmart's GCS integration requirement could put Alluxio back in a leading position for the account and that VAST should be careful.

- Jeff Denworth asked VAST Product Management management to analyze Walmart's restated requirements and determine what should be incorporated into the VAST product plan, working with Mikey and team.
