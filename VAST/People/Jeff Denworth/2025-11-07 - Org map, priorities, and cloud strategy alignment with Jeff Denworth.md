# Org map, priorities, and cloud strategy alignment with Jeff Denworth

**Date**: 2025-11-07
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jeff Denworth

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Jeff Denworth reviewed VAST’s org landscape and near-term priorities, with emphasis on building a pragmatic cross-cloud strategy that goes beyond basic S3 compatibility. They aligned on org changes (Carl moving to ProServe under Rob; Morty transitioning to Jason’s team while continuing Neo cloud responsibilities) and on operational discipline (FRDs and customer requirements living in Confluence).

## Decisions


- Carl will move to Professional Services (ProServe) under Rob because Jeff Denworth assessed Carl as not suitable for customer-facing roles.

- Morty will transition to Jason Vallery’s team while continuing ownership of Neo cloud feature requirements.

- Jason Vallery owns defining cross-cloud product strategy and prioritization across AWS, Azure, and Google, with a focus beyond basic S3 compatibility.

- FRDs and customer requirements will be authored and maintained in Confluence (coordinated with Alon Horev and Tomer Hagay).




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated that Sagi owns the pipelines product and is building the serverless layer, and that VAST has under-thought how to package and sell this capability in cloud environments (for example, how customers would request runtimes, C-nodes, or GPUs).

- Jeff Denworth described John as the leader for alliances, including partner questions related to AMD and NVIDIA.

- Jeff Denworth said Idsoc is working on block storage and is critical to reaching a critical mass of business in that area.

- Jeff Denworth and Jason Vallery aligned that FRDs and customer requirements should be authored and maintained in Confluence, coordinated with Alon Horev and Tomer Hagay.

- Jeff Denworth directed Jason Vallery to embed with Sales Engineers and talk directly to customers to understand real workflows and translate them into product requirements and prioritization.

- Jeff Denworth requested a monthly touchpoint between Jason Vallery and Brandon to align on cloud platform priorities.

- The team identified that Customer Success is largely reactive support today and that the product management team is small relative to product scope.
