# Org map and cloud strategy

**Date**: 2025-11-07
**With**: Myself, Jeff Denworth

## Summary

Reviewed the org landscape and clarified near-term priorities around building a pragmatic cross-cloud strategy beyond basic S3 hosting. Jeff emphasized embedding with SEs and customers to learn real workflows, cataloging in-flight opportunities from a product-requirements lens, and building a control-plane-partner-led “cloud in a box” motion. Org decisions included moving Carl to ProServe under Rob and transitioning Morty to my team while he continues owning Neo cloud feature requirements; FRDs/requirements should be maintained in Confluence.
## Action Items
- [ ?] Prepare for Google RFP/TPU discussion; align questions and decision criteria to avoid block I/O-heavy scope where NetApp excels @Myself 📅 2025-11-13 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ?] Create a concise “dagger” slide quantifying Azure Storage gaps vs VAST for Microsoft exec conversations @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed

- [ ?] Meet Sagi to understand pipelines/serverless roadmap and cloud packaging gaps @Myself #task #proposed
- [ ?] Meet John (alliances) to shape “cloud in a box” strategy and engage control-plane partners (G Corp, Ori, Arna, Rafe) @Myself #task #proposed
- [ ?] Pull Morty into alliances/control-plane planning to ensure Neo cloud feature alignment @Myself #task #proposed

- [ ?] Confirm Morty’s transition to my team while preserving Neo cloud commitments @Jeff Denworth Denworth #task #proposed

- [ ?] Draft initial cross-cloud embedding plan (Foundry, Bedrock, Vertex) for review @Myself #task #proposed
- [ ?] Propose a lightweight quarterly win/loss review cadence with Sales Ops and Product @Myself #task #proposed

## Decisions
- Carl will move to ProServe under Rob due to customer-facing risk.
- Morty will transition to my team while continuing to own Neo cloud feature requirements.
- Myself owns defining the cross-cloud product strategy and prioritization.
- Customer requirements and FRDs will be authored and maintained in Confluence.

## Key Information
- Sagi owns pipelines/serverless and is key to cloud packaging/runtime gaps.
- John runs alliances/channels (conventional partnerships; not yet cloud channels).
- Customer Success is currently reactive support rather than proactive CS.
- PM team is small relative to product scope; product functions are distributed across the org.
- Tool sprawl (Google/M365/Slack/Atlassian) is causing friction and missed signals.
- Thursday in Orlando includes a Google RFP/TPU-angled meeting; avoid block I/O-heavy pursuits where NetApp is strong.
- Jeff wants field-embedded learning via SEs and direct customer conversations.
- Control-plane partners mentioned for “cloud in a box”: G Corp, Ori, Arna, Rafe.
