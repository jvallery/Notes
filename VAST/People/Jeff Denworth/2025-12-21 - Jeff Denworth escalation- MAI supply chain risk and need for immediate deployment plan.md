# Jeff Denworth escalation: MAI supply chain risk and need for immediate deployment plan

**Date**: 2025-12-21
**With**: Jeff Denworth, Jason Vallery, Lior Genzel, Renen Hallak, Alon Horev, Shachar Fienblit, Avery Pham, Jonsi Stefansson, Rick Scurfield, Anson (Qi)

## Summary

Jeff Denworth escalated that VAST is selling out of supply, lead times are rising, and nothing is reserved for Microsoft MAI. He asked whether Microsoft expects to use VAST supply chain and stressed that if MAI wants an April to June 2026 deployment, VAST needs a concrete plan immediately.


## Action Items


- [?] Send Jeff Denworth the most recent analysis Jason Vallery has regarding the Microsoft MAI deal (including supply chain, capacity, and timing assumptions). @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Drive introductions to Microsoft MAI stakeholders Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, and Karén Simonyan to establish direct communication paths beyond Kushal. @Lior Genzel ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Identify the most strategic environment to run Anson (Qi) VAST PoC for 1,000 to 2,000 GPU scale testing, evaluating MAI/Vipin environment vs Nscale vs CoreWeave clusters. @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate solution design discussion with Alon Horev and Kushal for Microsoft MAI storage deployment architecture. @Alon Horev #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Clarify with Microsoft MAI whether they expect to use VAST Data supply chain and, if so, define what is required to support an April to June 2026 deployment window given no inventory is reserved. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Lior Genzel will lead efforts to obtain introductions to key Microsoft MAI stakeholders (Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, Karén Simonyan) to reduce reliance on Kushal as the sole conduit.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated that VAST Data is quickly selling out of supply and lead times are skyrocketing, so there is nothing reserved for Microsoft MAI unless a plan is made immediately.

- Jeff Denworth asked whether Microsoft MAI expects to use VAST Data's supply chain for the MAI storage deployment.

- Jason Vallery reported hearing from multiple Azure contacts that the final MAI storage decision is Mustafa's and that Kushal cannot be trusted.

- Jason Vallery stated he has no current relationship with Majid Mohammed (Mustafa's chief of staff), Yunchao Gong (Kushal's manager), or Karén Simonyan (Yunchao's manager and chief scientist reporting to Mustafa).

- Jason Vallery stated that Lior Genzel will take the lead on getting introductions to Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, and Karén Simonyan at Microsoft MAI.

- Lior Genzel reported that Anson (Qi) requested moving his VAST proof of concept into either the MAI/Vipin environment or other Nscale or CoreWeave clusters because Microsoft labs lack 1,000 to 2,000 GPUs for scale performance testing.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal said MAI's initial GPU drop will arrive in February 2026 and MAI needs a storage solution ready for May to June 2026; January 2026 is no longer a hard date.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal said MAI will decide on the storage deployment and told Manish that Azure Blob does not make sense versus VAST for MAI requirements.

- Lior Genzel reported that Vamshi, who leads the Azure Blob product, said Microsoft's decision is internal and expressed frustration with VAST highlighting Azure Blob deficiencies aggressively.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal requested a meeting with Alon Horev the following week to discuss MAI solution design.

- Jeff Denworth stated that supply chain constraints are expected through 2026 and recommended taking the whole MAI deal down in one shot with partial delivery milestones.

- Renen Hallak stated that Microsoft should have its own flash allocation with NAND manufacturers and that VAST efficiencies could reduce Microsoft's NAND needs and potentially free allocation for other customers.

- Jeff Denworth stated that Sagar took a job at Nscale and that Sagar had stepped into Nidhi's role after she left Microsoft.

- Lior Genzel reported that Sagar resigned from Microsoft and will likely join Nscale, and VAST planned to speak with him for advice on navigating Microsoft internal politics.
