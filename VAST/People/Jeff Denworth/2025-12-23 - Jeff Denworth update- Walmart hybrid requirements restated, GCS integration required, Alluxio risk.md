# Jeff Denworth update: Walmart hybrid requirements restated, GCS integration required, Alluxio risk

**Date**: 2025-12-23
**With**: Jeff Denworth, Myself, Mikey

## Summary

Jeff Denworth relayed outcomes from Walmart's internal requirements meeting: Walmart still needs a long-term hybrid solution and cannot accept two disjoint namespaces. Walmart plans an on-prem-only big data POC and requires integration with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), which may increase competitive risk from Alluxio; Jeff asked PM management to analyze requirements and feed the product plan with a path to full estate takeover.


## Action Items


- [?] Analyze Walmart's restated requirements from their internal requirements meeting (hybrid long-term solution, unified namespace, GCS integration requirement, on-prem-only POC scope) and propose what changes should be incorporated into VAST Data's cloud and hybrid product plan. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Mikey and team to validate Walmart's technical requirements (unified namespace and GCS integration expectations) and identify a concrete path to 'total estate takeover' for the Walmart data platform footprint. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Assess competitive positioning and risk from Alluxio for Walmart given the GCS integration requirement, and identify mitigation actions for VAST Data (product gaps, integration strategy, and GTM messaging). @Myself #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Walmart held an internal requirements meeting during the week of 2025-12-22 and restated that they need a long-term hybrid solution for their data team.

- Walmart was not successful in getting the business to accept two disjoint namespaces, implying any acceptable solution must present a unified namespace across environments.

- Walmart plans to start an internal big data proof of concept (POC) sometime in 2026, limited to workloads that can run exclusively on premises.

- Walmart requires integration with Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for any solution they move forward with, or alternatively would need significant database-layer lobbying including a hybrid cloud database approach.

- Jeff Denworth assessed that Walmart's GCS integration requirement could put Alluxio back in a leading position for Walmart, creating competitive risk for VAST Data.

- Jeff Denworth asked VAST product management leadership to analyze Walmart's restated requirements and determine what should be incorporated into VAST's product plan, coordinating with Mikey and team.
