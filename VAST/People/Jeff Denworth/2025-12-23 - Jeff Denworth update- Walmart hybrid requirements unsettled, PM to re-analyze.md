# Jeff Denworth update: Walmart hybrid requirements unsettled, PM to re-analyze

**Date**: 2025-12-23
**With**: Jeff Denworth, Myself, Mikey

## Summary

Jeff Denworth shared that Walmart re-stated requirements after an internal meeting, emphasizing a long-term hybrid solution and rejecting two disjoint namespaces. Walmart plans an on-prem-only big data POC and requires integration with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), which may put Alluxio back in a leading position. Jeff asked PM management to analyze requirements and determine what should enter the product plan, with a focus on a path to full estate takeover.


## Action Items


- [?] Analyze Walmart's re-stated hybrid requirements (unified namespace, GCS integration, on-prem-only POC constraints) and propose what changes should be incorporated into the VAST product plan. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Mikey and relevant team members to validate Walmart requirements, competitive positioning versus Alluxio, and define a path to full estate takeover at Walmart. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Walmart held an internal requirements meeting during the week of 2025-12-22 and re-stated that they need a long-term hybrid solution for their data team.

- Walmart was not successful in getting the business to accept two disjoint namespaces, implying they require a unified namespace approach across environments.

- Walmart plans to start an internal big data proof of concept (POC) sometime in 2025, limited to workloads that can run exclusively on premises.

- Walmart requires any forward solution to integrate with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), or else requires significant database-layer lobbying including potentially a hybrid cloud database.

- Jeff Denworth warned that Walmart's requirements may put Alluxio back in the driver seat, creating competitive risk for VAST.

- Jeff Denworth asked VAST Product Management leadership to analyze Walmart's re-stated requirements and decide what should be incorporated into the VAST product plan, coordinating with Mikey and team.
