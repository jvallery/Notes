# Jeff Denworth: Walmart requirements reset, hybrid + single namespace, GCS integration risk

**Date**: 2025-12-23
**With**: Jeff Denworth, Myself, Mikey

## Summary

Jeff Denworth relayed that Walmart re-stated requirements after an internal meeting: they need a long-term hybrid solution, cannot accept two disjoint namespaces, and require integration with Google Cloud Storage (GCS). Walmart plans an internal big data POC in 2025 limited to on-prem-only workloads, and Jeff flagged Alluxio as a potential competitive risk. Jeff asked PM management to analyze the updated requirements and decide what should enter the VAST product plan, working with Mikey and team.


## Action Items


- [?] Analyze Walmart's re-stated requirements (hybrid solution, single namespace, GCS integration) and determine what should be incorporated into the VAST product plan. @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] PM management to coordinate with Mikey and team to drive the Walmart requirements analysis and product plan updates. @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Define a clear strategy and execution path for VAST to achieve full platform adoption at Walmart ("total estate takeover"), accounting for GCS integration and single-namespace constraints. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Walmart stated they need to build a long-term hybrid solution for their data team and were not successful in getting the business to accept two disjoint namespaces.

- Walmart plans to start an internal big data proof of concept (POC) in 2025, limited to workloads that can exclusively run on premises.

- Walmart indicated any solution they move forward with will require integration with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), or significant lobbying at the database layer including potentially a hybrid cloud database.

- Jeff Denworth believes Alluxio may be back in the driver seat for Walmart due to the GCS integration requirement and warned VAST to be careful.
