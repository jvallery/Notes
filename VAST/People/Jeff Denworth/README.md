## Key Decisions

- Approve the VAST Cloud vision statement and scope boundaries for FY26, including the "Neocloud-in-a-box" concept and explicit "what we will not build" in the next 12 months.

- Endorse core-first prioritization for FY26, deferring opinionated higher-layer services until the base platform is proven at scale.
