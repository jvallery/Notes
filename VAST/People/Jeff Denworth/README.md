## Profile

**Role**: VAST
**Relationship**: Collaborator/assignee on Microsoft-related tasks

**Background**:
- Involved in drafting Microsoft networking engagement plan to minimize egress for VAST’s Azure offerings and validating Azure GA milestones aligned to Lifter program phases.
- Referenced via @jeff tag in a task query; no additional context provided in this note.
- Discusses strategy for addressing Microsoft/OpenAI needs; prefers broader market approach (“in for a pound”) vs focusing only on first two customers; skeptical that Rockset/OpenAI can quickly build a hyperscale object store; notes their own solution took a decade and is still unreliable at times.

## Open Tasks

- [ ] Catch up with Jeff on Microsoft topics, review/discuss Jason’s draft document, and align on direction.
- [ ] Weigh trade-offs and make a decision on Blob API vs Microsoft’s Tuscany vs customer demand (breadth of surface area; MVP vs full solution).
- [ ] Prepare and deliver the SCO and the presentation Jeff wants Jason to do.

## Key Facts

- Networking engagement plan should focus on minimizing egress for VAST’s Azure offerings (e.g., ExpressRoute Direct Local).
- Azure GA milestones need alignment with Lifter program phases (Feb GA vs Sep 1P milestone).
- ROI comparisons require validation of what Microsoft data is permissible to use before sharing externally (e.g., with Nidhi).
- Microsoft BizDev enablement messaging includes density/power and a single-namespace story.
- A one-pager was created to translate VAST EB power savings into additional GPUs per site for stakeholders including MAI (Mustafa), Kushal, and Vipin.
- There is consideration to extend the Marketplace L-series offer via higher-density storage SKUs or an OEM hardware path.
- Dre Jackson is Technical Enablement Director; team recently added 2 heads and is hiring 2 more.
- Dre runs a weekly SE call alternating technical sales upskilling and leadership/field updates, with 10-minute competitive/pitch segments.
- Jason Vallery is ex-Microsoft Azure object storage PM; supported OpenAI; now owns PM for VAST cloud and frontier model builders.
- There is no transactable VAST cloud marketplace yet; current motion is private offers with Google with a roadmap to enable AWS and Azure.
