## Key Facts

- Google Distributed Cloud has connected and air-gapped variants; NetApp is the incumbent storage partner.
- Google issued a US-based RFP to replace NetApp for GDC storage; VAST was invited to respond and is undergoing vendor due diligence.
- Google’s emphasis areas include air-gapped support, compliance/attestations (e.g., DISA STIG), ops model (updates, staffing, troubleshooting), multi-tenancy, quotas, encryption, and tags.
- Fort Meade "Gemini as a service" on-prem initiative is described as a Q4 commit and a near-term joint validation path.
- GDC deployments commonly run on Dell; HPE and Cisco are also in scope for hardware options.
- VAST recently launched Google Marketplace offers; broader partnership is still early.
- Resource risk: Greg may be heavily focused on Leidos next year, potentially impacting continuity.
- All listed Microsoft/Azure tasks were completed on 2025-11-08.
- Focus areas included minimizing Azure egress (ExpressRoute Direct Local), aligning Azure GA milestones with Lifter phases, and producing BizDev/ROI/marketplace collateral.
- Walmart uses Azure for dot-com systems and GCP (BigQuery/GCS) for enterprise analytics.

## Topics

Google Distributed Cloud RFP response strategy, Air-gapped/dark-site readiness and operational support model, Compliance evidence, certifications, and ATO considerations, Hardware platform options (Dell/HPE/Cisco) vs commodity VM shapes, RDMA and VM shape tradeoffs, Fort Meade on-prem Gemini validation path, Coordination between Google corporate GDC and Google Federal teams, Joint federal account alignment and co-selling, Google Marketplace offers and broader partnership tracks, TPU/model-builder partnership track, Microsoft Azure networking and egress minimization, Azure GA milestones and Lifter program alignment, ROI data usage validation for comparisons, LSv4/LSv5 vs OEM/ODM vs Azure Storage positioning, Microsoft BizDev enablement and introductions

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Greg Castellucci will run point with Google Federal and coordinate with the corporate GDC team over the next few weeks.
- ✅ Jason Vallery will coordinate RFP content assembly and connect Greg with Google stakeholders.
- ✅ Alon Horev will conduct a 1:1 with Muninder Singh Sambi focused on AI, VM shapes/RDMA, and hardware tradeoffs.
- ✅ Leo will own the end-to-end formal RFP response and submission.
- ✅ Use the Fort Meade on-prem Gemini initiative as the primary near-term validation path/reference.
- ✅ Include Dell and HPE SKU recommendations and consider Cisco/commodity VM options in the architecture proposal.
- ✅ Use SyncEngine for the pilot to replicate from GCS to on-prem VAST clusters.
- ✅ Pursue GCS API compatibility on the roadmap; S3 alone is insufficient for Walmart.
- ✅ Focus the pilot on real Walmart workloads (tables/queries), not synthetic benchmarks.
- ✅ Consolidate questions and send to Walmart before scheduling the design session.
