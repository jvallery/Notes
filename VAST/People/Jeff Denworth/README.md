- Jason Vallery reports to Jeff Denworth.

- Jeff Denworth is Jason Vallery's manager at VAST Data.

- Jeff Denworth wants VAST Data to have a first-class, homogenized cloud platform strategy across hyperscalers and Neo clouds, rather than ad hoc deal-by-deal execution.

- Jeff Denworth was referenced as a key stakeholder for clarifying ownership boundaries and decision rights for cloud work versus core platform work.

- Jason Vallery reports to Jeff Denworth for cloud product responsibility at VAST Data and is aligning org planning and ownership with him.

- Jeff Denworth directed that VAST Data should not scope Azure Blob API work only around OpenAI and Microsoft AI, and instead should pursue a broader market approach ("in for a pound").

- Jeff Denworth expressed skepticism that a Rockset-derived team can successfully build a geoscale, hyperscale object store, noting VAST Data took a decade to build its own and still has reliability issues.
