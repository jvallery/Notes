## Profile

**Role**: VAST
**Relationship**: Primary counterpart in this discussion; Jason is updating him and aligning on decisions.

**Background**:
- Referenced via @jeff tag in a task query; no additional context provided in this note.
- Discusses strategy for addressing Microsoft/OpenAI needs; prefers broader market approach (“in for a pound”) vs focusing only on first customers; skeptical that Rockset/OpenAI can quickly build a hyperscale object store; notes VAST took a decade and still has reliability issues.

## Open Tasks

- [ ] Catch up with Jeff on Microsoft-related items, review/discuss Jason’s draft document progress, and align on direction (Blob API vs Tuscany vs customer demand trade-offs).
- [ ] Discuss the SCO and the presentation Jeff wants Jason to do; clarify scope and prepare content.
- [ ] Have conversations with OpenAI about potentially providing a sync engine (per Jeff’s suggestion) if access/engagement can be established.
- [ ] Evaluate competitive risk and implications of OpenAI’s in-house storage/object-store efforts (Rockset/RocksDB-based) and Microsoft’s IP rights to OpenAI code, including impact if OpenAI/Microsoft relationship changes (AGI trigger).

## Key Facts

- OpenAI is reportedly replatforming away from Azure Blob API for some scenarios, replacing parts with their own solution using Rclone and other components.
- Pete Eming (reports to Vamshi) took over ownership of the Azure Storage relationship with OpenAI and Microsoft AI after Jason left about a year ago.
- Jason believes the main competition at OpenAI is internal: an in-house storage/object-store effort tied to Rockset/RocksDB rather than external vendors.
- Microsoft’s deal with OpenAI was described as giving Microsoft exclusive ownership/rights to every line of code written at OpenAI until an AGI declaration event; this could allow Microsoft to reuse OpenAI-developed storage IP for Azure services.
- OpenAI is reportedly getting bare metal L-Series, bare metal UltraDisc, and Blob Storage HDD clusters; some may be used to run the Rockset-based solution.
- This note is configured to surface all not-done tasks whose description includes @jeff, sorted by created date (reverse).
