# Jeff Denworth flags MAI supply chain risk and need for immediate plan (no Microsoft inventory reserved)

**Date**: 2025-12-21
**With**: Jeff Denworth, Jason Vallery, Lior Genzel, Renen Hallak, Alon Horev, Shachar Feinblit, Avery Pham, Jonsi Stefansson, Rick Scurfield, Manish Sah, Kushal Datta, Kanchan Mehrotra, Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, Karén Simonyan, Vamshi (Azure Blob product lead, last name unknown), Sagar (last name unknown), Anson (Qi) (last name unknown), Vipin (last name unknown), Mustafa (last name unknown), Nidhi (last name unknown)

## Summary

Jeff Denworth warned that VAST is selling out of inventory, lead times are rising, and nothing is reserved for Microsoft, so any MAI deployment target in April to June requires an immediate supply chain plan. The thread also captures internal Microsoft decision dynamics (Mustafa as final decision maker) and a push to build relationships with key MAI stakeholders beyond Kushal.


## Action Items


- [?] Send Jeff Denworth the most recent Jason Vallery analysis related to the Microsoft MAI deal (as requested: 'Jason, please DM me your most recent analysis'). @Myself 📅 2025-12-12 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Work with Lior Genzel to establish communication and build trust with Microsoft MAI stakeholders Majid Mohammed (Mustafa chief of staff), Yunchao Gong (Kushal Datta's manager), and Karén Simonyan (chief scientist, Mustafa org). @Lior Genzel ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Define a supply chain plan for any Microsoft MAI deployment targeting April to June 2026, explicitly addressing that no inventory is reserved for Microsoft and VAST Data lead times are increasing. @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Prioritize and select the most strategic environment for Anson (Qi) to run the VAST PoC with 1,000 to 2,000 GPUs, evaluating MAI/Vipin environment vs Nscale vs CoreWeave clusters. @Lior Genzel #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Alon Horev to evaluate options for the Anson (Qi) PoC environment and to potentially merge Kushal Datta's MAI plan with Qi's PoC plan into a single validation path. @Lior Genzel #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Prepare analysis of working capital and opportunity cost for VAST Data versus Microsoft if Microsoft purchases 100 EB, as requested by Jeff Denworth. @Jeff Denworth #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Answer Jeff Denworth's question on whether Microsoft MAI expects to use VAST Data's supply chain for any part of the deployment and clarify sourcing responsibility for required capacity (including 2 EB). @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Lior Genzel will lead efforts to obtain introductions to key Microsoft MAI stakeholders Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, and Karén Simonyan to reduce reliance on Kushal Datta as the sole channel.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated VAST Data is quickly selling out of inventory and lead times are increasing, so any Microsoft MAI deployment in April, May, or June requires an immediate supply chain plan and there is currently nothing reserved for Microsoft.

- Jeff Denworth asked whether Microsoft MAI expects to use VAST Data's supply chain for any part of the deployment.

- Jason Vallery reported hearing from multiple Azure stakeholders that the final storage decision for the MAI project is made by a person named Mustafa (last name not provided).

- Jason Vallery reported hearing from multiple Azure stakeholders that Kushal Datta cannot be trusted, and Jason is concerned Kushal may be misrepresenting VAST Data's status as the preferred solution.

- Jason Vallery stated he has no current relationship with Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, or Karén Simonyan (key Microsoft MAI stakeholders) and that Lior Genzel will lead efforts to obtain introductions.

- Lior Genzel stated there is no waiting time in the current MAI plan and VAST Data is positioned to accelerate the process.

- Lior Genzel reported that Anson (Qi) requested moving a VAST PoC into either the MAI/Vipin environment or other clusters (Nscale or CoreWeave) because their lab cluster lacks 1,000 to 2,000 GPUs needed for performance scale testing.

- Jeff Denworth stated supply chain constraints are expected to be a major issue for the upcoming year and asked how VAST Data would source a Microsoft requirement of 2 EB, including when it must be ordered and from which supplier.

- Jeff Denworth stated Sagar (last name unknown) took a job at Nscale and asked for an end-of-week status summary; he also requested analysis of working capital and opportunity cost if Microsoft is buying 100 EB.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal Datta said the initial Microsoft GPU drop will arrive in February 2026 and that MAI needs a storage solution ready for a May to June 2026 timeframe, with January no longer a hard date.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal Datta said MAI will decide on the storage deployment and that Kushal told Manish Sah that Azure Blob does not meet MAI requirements compared to VAST Data.

- Lior Genzel reported that Vamshi (Azure Blob product lead, last name unknown) emphasized Microsoft's decision is internal and expressed frustration with VAST Data's aggressive approach in highlighting Azure Blob deficiencies.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal Datta requested a meeting with Alon Horev the following week to discuss solution design for Microsoft MAI.

- Renen Hallak stated Microsoft should have its own flash allocation with NAND manufacturers and that VAST Data efficiencies could reduce Microsoft's NAND needs and potentially allow use of Microsoft's excess allocation for other customers.
