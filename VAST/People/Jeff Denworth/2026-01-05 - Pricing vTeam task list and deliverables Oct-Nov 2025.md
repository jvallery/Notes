It covers private-offer pricing structure and discount guardrails, marketplace entitlements for Google private offers, PAYGO and multi-tenant SaaS offer planning, competitive pricing analysis, and finance alignment on ARR and valuation metrics.

- [?] Propose cloud private-offer pricing structure and discount guidance (capacity-only) for immediate use by the field. @Tomer Hagay 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Define and publish a cloud-specific discount policy for private offers to avoid extreme discounts. @Pricing vTeam 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto
