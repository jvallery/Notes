# 1:1 with Jeff Denworth: cloud pipeline synthesis, pricing/consumption debate, and event planning (Tel Aviv, Tech Summit, Supercomputing)

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jeff Denworth

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Jeff Denworth aligned on near-term priorities: build a synthesized cloud pipeline and requirements view across major hyperscalers, prioritize Microsoft, and develop a Google TPU strategy. They deferred an OpenAI alignment session until OpenAI actively engages, and they discussed risks of broad consumption pricing on on-prem prepaid revenue and utilization dynamics. They also covered upcoming travel and internal relationship-building, plus imminent org changes moving people under Jason’s scope.


## Action Items


- [?] Draft a pricing and consumption model write-up (including unit of billing, PAYGO vs reserved commit, and on-prem guardrails) and share with Jeff Denworth and Yancey (last name unknown) for discussion. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule a cloud alignment working session (whiteboard day) with Jeff Denworth and Yancey (last name unknown) to align on cloud product strategy and constraints. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Move designated team members under Jason Vallery’s scope and communicate the organizational changes. @Jeff Denworth 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Connect with Morty (full name unknown, possibly Mordecai) to align on second-tier cloud coverage and ownership boundaries. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Set up a regular 1:1 with Shahar (last name unknown) and define the cadence. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Reach out to Shahar (last name unknown) to plan the Tel Aviv agenda and sub-meetings. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Build a synthesized pipeline and requirements view for Oracle, Microsoft, AWS, and Google, and map VAST product fit and gaps. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Draft a Google TPU partnership strategy and positioning for GCP and neo-clouds, including competitive considerations with Google first-party storage. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Deepen product understanding by obtaining an R&D reading list or SOP and reviewing relevant Confluence documentation. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Increase presence on Slack (including pre-sales channels) and engage on cloud deployment threads to unblock teams and build context. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Set up a 1:1 with Andy Bernstein to learn meeting rhythms, channels, and how cloud topics are coordinated internally. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Introduce yourself and sync with program managers Liraz (last name unknown), Daphnas (last name unknown), Eyal Traitel, and Noa (last name unknown) to understand release and program rhythms. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Join the Supercomputing meeting schedule and add yourself to relevant customer meetings once the roster is available. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Set a small-group meeting at Supercomputing with Nidhi (last name unknown) and a relevant teammate (example mentioned: Jack, last name unknown). @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm Brett Tanzer’s participation and availability for the pricing and consumption model discussion. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Align with Yancey (last name unknown) on travel to enable an in-person working session for cloud alignment. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Rob Benoit (Global Sales Engineering) on Tech Summit content expectations and Jason Vallery’s role. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Validate what Microsoft data can be used in ROI comparisons before sharing any ROI comparison content with Nidhi (last name unknown). @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Do not run an OpenAI alignment session until OpenAI actively engages and commits to requirements discussions.

- Prioritize Microsoft as the primary cloud focus while simultaneously investing in a Google TPU partnership strategy.

- Include Brett Tanzer in the pricing and consumption model debate due to strong concerns about on-prem consumption pricing.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated that an OpenAI alignment session is not needed until OpenAI actively engages and commits, because VAST will respond to OpenAI requirements once they engage.

- Jeff Denworth stated that Lior Genzel has limited influence on product strategy because Lior is primarily a seller focused on setting meetings and driving sell-to motions, while product strategy alignment should be driven by Jeff Denworth, Yancey (last name unknown), and Jason Vallery.

- Jeff Denworth stated that broad consumption pricing applied to on-prem deployments could significantly harm VAST’s business model because on-prem clusters average about 30% utilization, which would reduce prepaid revenue and force difficult customer conversations about on-prem usage.

- Jeff Denworth stated that having a common pricing model between cloud and on-prem can be advantageous if customers are committing to VAST regardless of deployment location.

- Jason Vallery proposed scheduling a full-day cloud alignment working session (whiteboard day) with Jeff Denworth, Yancey (last name unknown), and potentially others to transfer historical context and align on cloud product strategy, constraints, and priorities.

- Jason Vallery planned travel and event participation including Tel Aviv (flight on the 21st, month not specified), Tech Summit in Orlando, and Supercomputing, where Jason will join customer meetings and set a small-group meeting with Nidhi (last name unknown).

- Notes indicate Brett Tanzer is currently anti-consumption pricing, especially for on-prem deployments, and should be included in the pricing and consumption model discussion.

- Notes indicate Lior Genzel focuses on hyperscalers and also has sell-to obligations, including Microsoft AI research/MapFalcon with approximately 16,000 GPUs.
