# 1:1 with Jeff Denworth: org landscape, cloud PM scope, China posture, and near-term execution artifacts

**Date**: 2025-11-07
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jeff Denworth

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Jeff Denworth reviewed VAST Data org structure and key players, aligned on Jason owning multi-cloud strategy end-to-end, and emphasized hands-on technical grounding plus tighter PM process (Confluence FRDs, win-loss cadence). They agreed China should be treated as a sales outpost (software-only) rather than a CAPEX or headcount build-out, and confirmed Carl will move to ProServe under Rob.


## Action Items

- [?] Reach out to Sagi (VAST Data) to connect and understand his work on the Pipelines product and the serverless layer, focusing on implications for cloud packaging. @Myself 📅 2025-11-14 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule time with Morty (VAST Data) to onboard him into Jason Vallery's team while keeping Morty focused on Neo cloud feature requirements. @Myself 📅 2025-11-14 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Set up monthly 1:1 meetings with Renan (VAST Data) to get an additional perspective on organizational strategy and product strategy. @Myself 📅 2025-11-21 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Work with Tomer Hagay to learn the Confluence process for storing FRDs and requirements, then publish an initial v0.1 artifact set for cloud strategy and requirements. @Myself 📅 2025-11-28 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Create the internal "dagger" slide that crisply quantifies Azure Storage gaps and can be reused as a repeatable narrative across clouds. @Myself 📅 2025-11-28 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Stand up a win-loss cadence (process + initial dataset) to track cloud-related wins, losses, and reasons, and feed learnings into requirements and per-cloud plays. @Myself 📅 2025-12-05 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Have a conversation with Aaron (identity unclear in transcript) about being over-rotated on building pipelines and rebalancing focus as needed. @Jeff Denworth 📅 2025-11-21 #task #proposed #auto

## Decisions


- VAST Data will treat China as a sales outpost (software-only sales) and will not pursue a significant CAPEX or headcount build-out in China.

- Carl will move to ProServe under Rob's leadership at VAST Data.

- VAST Data product requirements and FRDs will be stored in Confluence (Jason Vallery to follow the Confluence process).




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth expects Jason Vallery to own VAST Data multi-cloud strategy end-to-end, translating live deal flow into product requirements, Confluence documentation, and focused cloud plays across Azure, AWS, GCP, and Oracle, including hyperscaler AI platforms (Foundry, Bedrock, Vertex).

- Jeff Denworth emphasized that VAST Data product managers must be hands-on with the technology to make informed decisions and set effective strategy.

- Jason Vallery and Jeff Denworth aligned that VAST Data should treat China as a sales outpost (software-only sales acceptable) and avoid significant CAPEX or operational infrastructure investment in China.

- Jason Vallery shared an example from his prior experience that ByteDance bypassed Azure Storage by connecting its own data center to Azure via a high-capacity WAN, illustrating operational and technical challenges for storage in China.

- Jeff Denworth stated that VAST Data Customer Success operates more like reactive support than proactive customer success.

- Jeff Denworth indicated that FRDs and product requirements should be stored in Confluence and that Jason Vallery should learn and follow the Confluence documentation process.

- Jeff Denworth wants a crisp internal slide quantifying Microsoft Azure Storage gaps, and views Jason Vallery's Azure throughput anecdote as useful internal proof if anonymized.

- Jeff Denworth uses Apple Calendar alongside Google Calendar for meeting management.

- Jeff Denworth shared a storage TCO calculator (HDD to SSD tipping-point) intended to help tune VAST Data cloud economics narratives.
