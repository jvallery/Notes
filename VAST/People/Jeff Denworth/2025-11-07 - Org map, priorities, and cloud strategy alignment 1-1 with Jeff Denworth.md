# Org map, priorities, and cloud strategy alignment (1:1 with Jeff Denworth)

**Date**: 2025-11-07
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jeff Denworth

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Jeff Denworth reviewed VAST Data's org landscape, immediate priorities, and how Cloud Product should embed with SEs and customers to learn real workflows. Jeff set direction to catalog in-flight opportunities from a product requirements lens, centralize FRDs in Confluence, and drive a pragmatic cross-cloud strategy beyond basic S3 by integrating with platform services like Foundry, Bedrock, and Vertex. They also aligned on org moves (Carl to ProServe under Rob; Morty transitioning to Jason's team while continuing Neo cloud feature ownership) and near-term prep for a Google RFP/TPU discussion.

## Decisions

- Carl will move to Professional Services (ProServe) under Rob Banga because Jeff Denworth assessed Carl as not suitable for customer-facing roles.

- Morty will transition to Jason Vallery's team while continuing to own Neo cloud feature requirements.

- Customer requirements and FRDs for VAST Data cloud initiatives will be authored and maintained in Confluence as the canonical source, coordinated with Alon Horev and Tomer Hagay.

- Jason Vallery will own defining cross-cloud product strategy and prioritization, with emphasis on going beyond basic S3 compatibility.
