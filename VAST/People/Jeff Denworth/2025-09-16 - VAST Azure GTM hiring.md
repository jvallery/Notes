# VAST Azure GTM hiring

**Date**: 2025-09-16
**Account**: [[VAST]]
**Attendees**: Jeff Denworth, Jason Vallery

## Summary

Jeff Denworth and Jason Vallery discussed VAST’s accelerated cloud go-to-market push and potential roles for Jason, with an initial focus on Azure business development/strategic leadership paired with a technical counterpart. They reviewed VAST’s cloud timelines (GCP/AWS/Azure), Lifter signing with Microsoft, multi/neo-cloud strategy, and the need to mitigate egress costs via Microsoft networking options such as ExpressRoute Direct Local. They agreed to start VAST’s interview/HR process for Jason and to set up leadership introductions and a Microsoft networking engagement plan.

## Decisions
- Start HR process and interviews for Jason at VAST.
- Initial role emphasis for Jason: Azure-focused business development/strategic lead, paired with a highly technical counterpart.

## Key Information
- Jason has ~13 years at Microsoft Azure; previously led/owned the OpenAI engagement and large-scale storage programs; recently returned from a 3-month sabbatical into an architect role under Manish.
- Azure Storage org is ~1,600+ people; Jason cited slow execution/culture challenges.
- VAST is prioritizing cloud GTM; Jeff plans to ramp from 1 to 10–15 hires, with a 3-person core per cloud (sales specialist, BD lead, technical lead).
- VAST signed Microsoft Lifter and is pursuing Azure marketplace, customer-tenant managed offering, and a future 1P alignment path.
- Cloud GA plan discussed: GCP GA in October (next month), AWS GA (MVP) in December, Azure GA in February; broader Azure/Lifter milestone targeted next September.
- VAST differentiators highlighted: global namespace across regions/clouds and SyncEngine for cross-system/object tiering; versions 5.3 nearing 5.4.
- Egress fees/cloud taxes are a key risk; ExpressRoute Direct Local was suggested as a mitigation approach.
- Strategic Azure pipeline examples cited: UK Met Office (second 320 PB on Azure with VAST) and Wave (currently CoreWeave; intent to use VAST on Azure).
