# Jeff Denworth escalates Azure MAI deal risk and pushes January execution plan

**Date**: 2025-12-27
**With**: Jeff Denworth, Jonsi Stefansson, Lior Genzel, Rick Scurfield, Renen Hallak, Jason Vallery

## Summary

Jeff Denworth escalated concern that VAST is losing the chance of a Q1 deal with Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) due to slow execution and supply chain constraints. He laid out a January milestone plan (commercial presence in Redmond, supply chain/build discussions, executive alignment, then paperwork) and warned missing milestones makes the deal effectively impossible. Jonsi Stefansson reported Microsoft contacts (Aung and Maneesh) expect an Azure Blob integration proposal and that Microsoft supply chain intel is blocked until contacts return from OOO on January 5, 2026.


## Action Items


- [?] Sync with Jonsi Stefansson to produce and deliver an integration proposal for VAST Data with Azure Blob requested by Microsoft contacts Aung and Maneesh. @Myself 📅 2025-12-30 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Gather detailed intelligence on Microsoft MAI supply chain status and constraints, as requested by Jeff Denworth, to guide VAST Data deal strategy. @Jonsi Stefansson 📅 2026-01-05 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Set up an engineering workshop in Redmond with Microsoft MAI stakeholders to review VAST Data integration, including Azure Blob integration expectations. @Jonsi Stefansson 📅 2026-01-17 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Ensure either Lior Genzel or Jonsi Stefansson is in Redmond at the start of the new year to begin commercial discussions with Microsoft MAI. @TBD 📅 2026-01-05 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Initiate real supply chain and build planning conversations with Microsoft MAI stakeholders by the second week of January 2026, per Jeff Denworth's milestone plan. @TBD 📅 2026-01-16 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule Renen Hallak to be in Redmond in the third week of January 2026 to meet with a Microsoft stakeholder referred to as 'Scott G' to align philosophically on the first MAI tranche and expansion plan with VAST Data. @Renen Hallak 📅 2026-01-23 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Drive contract paperwork completion with Microsoft MAI during the last week of January 2026 to enable a January first order, per Jeff Denworth's plan. @TBD 📅 2026-01-30 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Establish a daily update cadence for the Microsoft MAI pursuit and communicate status to Jeff Denworth and the broader internal team. @Myself 📅 2026-01-02 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Jeff Denworth proposed operating assumption that CoreWeave testing for the Microsoft MAI deal is largely cosmetic and should not be treated as the gating factor for commercial execution.

- Jeff Denworth proposed that either Lior Genzel or Jonsi Stefansson should be physically in Redmond immediately at the start of the new year to begin commercial discussions with Microsoft MAI.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated he is rapidly losing confidence that VAST Data can close a Q1 deal with Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) unless VAST becomes more aggressive and executes a January plan.

- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) needs 2 exabytes of storage capacity on the floor in 2025 and must order hardware early due to supply chain constraints.

- Jeff Denworth stated global supply chain turmoil likely prevents VAST Data from supporting the MAI build natively via Arrow or Avnet.

- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft is also in a poor supply chain position but has a large allocation across Azure, and Microsoft is considering HDDs for the first April MAI scale-up delivery even though HDD supply is also constrained.

- Jeff Denworth stated testing at CoreWeave for the MAI-related effort has not started in earnest and VAST has not started commercial discussions for the MAI deal.

- Jeff Denworth asserted VAST Data is the most infrastructure-efficient software option for Microsoft MAI and that software choice materially impacts the overall hardware purchase.

- Jonsi Stefansson reported he met with Microsoft contacts named Aung and Maneesh, and they expect an integration proposal from VAST Data for Azure Blob.

- Jonsi Stefansson reported he emailed Microsoft contacts to determine Microsoft supply chain status and platform needs, but received out-of-office replies indicating they return on January 5, 2026.

- Jonsi Stefansson stated he and Jason Vallery planned to sync on the Azure Blob integration proposal and to set up an engineering workshop in Redmond in January 2026.

- Jonsi Stefansson is the GM of Cloud at VAST Data and provided two phone numbers: +3546987478 (while in Iceland) and +14079510436 (while in the US).
