# Org map and cloud focus

**Date**: 2025-11-07
**With**: Myself, Jeff Denworth

## Summary

In a 1:1, Jeff mapped key org roles and emphasized a hands-on approach: understand in-flight deal requirements, engage SEs, and architect a first-class cross-cloud strategy and cloud GTM plans (e.g., Foundry/Bedrock/Vertex). They discussed preparing for a Google RFP (likely TPU-related) and building a crisp Microsoft competitive narrative, while standardizing customer requirements/FRDs in Confluence for engineering consumption.
## Action Items
- [ ] Prepare for the Google RFP (TPU angle): compile questions, qualify scope, and ensure it is not block-I/O latency sensitive @Myself 📅 2025-11-13 🔺 #task
- [ ] Engage with SEs at Tech Summit in Orlando to gather field insights and build relationships @Myself 📅 2025-11-13 #task

## Decisions
- Carl will move to ProServe under Rob rather than supporting customer-facing PM work.
- Set a monthly touchpoint with Brandon to align on cloud platform priorities.
- Customer requirement docs and FRDs will be authored and maintained in Confluence.
- Primary focus is building a first-class cross-cloud platform and GTM versus ad hoc deal chasing.

## Key Information
- John runs alliances/partnerships and is the key contact for AMD/NVIDIA and non-cloud channel partnerships.
- Sagi leads pipelines/serverless; there are open questions on cloud GTM/packaging for these offerings.
- Morty owns Neo cloud feature requirements and must maintain that coverage while supporting the user’s area.
- Rob’s Customer Success org is primarily reactive support/systems engineering today; Carl is being reassigned there for cloud implementation help.
- Eric is Rick’s execution/deal-desk lead; Kristen runs enablement; Daphna and Leeraz handle release/program management; Dima is a deep technical fixer.
- Google RFP may be TPU-oriented; NetApp is strong on block I/O latency, so scope fit must be validated.
- Jeff will be in Orlando Tuesday through Thursday the following week for sales strategy meetings (not Tech Summit attendance).
