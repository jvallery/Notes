# Microsoft tasks backlog for Azure and MAI enablement (Oct 2025)

**Date**: 2026-01-05
**Project**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Jason Vallery, Jeff Denworth

## Summary

Task list capturing completed Microsoft-related work for VAST Data, focused on Azure networking/egress minimization, Azure Marketplace and L-series positioning, and MAI enablement collateral. All listed items were marked complete with a completion date of 2025-11-08.


## Action Items


- [?] Draft a Microsoft Azure networking engagement plan focused on minimizing egress for VAST Data Azure offerings, including ExpressRoute Direct Local. @Jeff Denworth 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Validate Azure GA milestones and align them with Microsoft Lifter program phases, including February GA and September first-party milestone alignment. @Jeff Denworth 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Validate what Microsoft data can be used in ROI comparisons before sharing the ROI comparison with Nidhi (last name not provided). @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Create a comparison slide for Microsoft conversations covering Azure LSv4, LSv5, OEM/ODM options, and Azure storage positioning. @TBD 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Educate Microsoft BizDev on VAST Data density/power efficiency and single-namespace narrative, and secure introductions to Ronnie Booker via John Tinter. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Create a one-pager converting VAST Data exabyte-level power savings into additional GPUs per site and share it with Microsoft AI Infrastructure stakeholders including Mustafa (last name not provided), Kushal (last name not provided), and Vipin (last name not provided). @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Assess complementing the Azure Marketplace L-series offer with higher-density storage SKUs or an OEM hardware path. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Position VAST Data Azure networking strategy around minimizing egress using options such as ExpressRoute Direct Local for Azure offerings.

- Use an Azure Marketplace L-series offer as a baseline and evaluate expansion via higher-density storage SKUs or an OEM hardware path.
