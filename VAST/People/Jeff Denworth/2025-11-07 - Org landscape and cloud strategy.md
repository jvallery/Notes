# Org landscape and cloud strategy

**Date**: 2025-11-07
**With**: Jeff Denworth, Jason Vallery

## Summary

Jason and Jeff reviewed the org landscape and key players, aligning that Jason will drive multi-cloud strategy and translate live deal flow into product requirements and Confluence documentation. They agreed China should be treated as a software-only sales outpost (no CAPEX/headcount build-out) and emphasized the need to embed with SEs and establish a win/loss cadence. They also decided to move Carl to ProServe under Rob and to use Confluence as the authoritative home for FRDs/requirements.
## Action Items
- [ ] Set up a 1:1 with John (alliances) to align on partnerships/control-plane ecosystem and cloud-in-a-box direction @Myself ⏫ #task
- [ ] Reach out to Sagi to understand pipelines/serverless roadmap and identify cloud packaging gaps @Myself ⏫ #task
- [ ] Schedule time with Morty to align on Neo priorities and define how his cycles will be used without jeopardizing Neo focus @Myself ⏫ #task
- [ ] Set up monthly 1:1 cadence with Brandon to align on first-class multi-cloud platform direction and success metrics @Myself ⏫ #task
- [ ] Meet with Ryan (database/data-engine overlay) and FWOD to understand GTM motions and gaps for database/pipeline services @Myself #task
- [ ] Catalog in-flight opportunities from a product requirements lens (what customers are trying to do, required features, and pursue vs. walk-away recommendations) @Myself ⏫ #task
- [ ] Work with A.L. and Tomer to learn the Confluence process/taxonomy and ensure FRDs/customer requirements are stored in Confluence going forward @Myself ⏫ #task
- [ ] Create a crisp 'dagger' slide quantifying Azure Storage gaps vs. VAST for Microsoft conversations (throughput/latency/ops friction) @Myself ⏫ #task
- [ ] Propose a lightweight recurring win/loss analysis and product MBR cadence tied to Sales Ops @Myself #task
- [ ] Have a conversation with Aaron about being over-rotated on building pipelines @Jeff #task
- [ ] Text ITSIC regarding block storage and getting to critical mass of business @Jeff #task
- [ ] Reassign Carl to ProServe under Rob @Jeff ⏫ #task

## Decisions
- Carl will move to ProServe under Rob.
- FRDs and detailed customer requirements will live in Confluence.
- China will be approached as a software-only sales outpost (no significant CAPEX/headcount build-out).
- Jason will own and drive the multi-cloud strategy end-to-end and translate deal flow into product requirements.

## Key Information
- John runs alliances/partnerships for conventional channels (and is the point person for AMD/NVIDIA questions); cloud BD is expected to be a separate motion (Lior).
- Sagi owns pipelines product and the serverless layer; key to cloud packaging and marketplace/on-ramp thinking.
- Morty owns Neo cloud feature requirements; moving to Jason’s team but must remain focused on Neo.
- Customer Success under Rob is effectively reactive support rather than proactive CS.
- SE org is critical to success; Hari called out as one of the best SEs; no single blueprint for who to talk to—Jason should engage broadly.
- Ryan runs the database/data-engine overlay; FWOD manages database/pipeline SEs (likely under Rob).
- Kristen runs enablement; Amy oversees finance/strategy; Eric is Rick’s execution/deal-desk right hand.
- NetApp is strong for block/low-latency I/O; ensure Google RFP is not block/latency-heavy before investing heavily.
- ByteDance anecdote: Azure Storage could not meet throughput targets; they connected their own storage via Equinix/WAN to Azure GPUs (sensitive/internal-only proof point).
