# Jeff 1:1 cloud priorities

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Account**: [[Jeff Denworth]]
**Attendees**: Jeff Denworth, Jason Vallery

## Summary

Jason and Jeff aligned on near-term priorities: synthesize a unified cloud pipeline/requirements view across Oracle, Microsoft, AWS, and Google, with Microsoft as the primary focus while developing a Google TPU partnership strategy. They discussed pricing/consumption model risks (especially for on-prem) and agreed Brett must be included in that debate; OpenAI alignment is deferred until OpenAI re-engages. They also covered org changes under Jason, key internal relationships to build (e.g., Shahar, Yancey, Morty), and upcoming travel/events (Tel Aviv, Tech Summit, Supercomputing).
## Action Items
- [ ?] Draft a pricing/consumption model write-up and share with Jeff and Yancey for discussion. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ?] Schedule a cloud alignment working session (whiteboard day) with Jeff and Yancey. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ?] Move designated team members under Jason’s scope and communicate the changes. @Jeff Denworth Denworth ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ?] Connect with Mordechai Blaunstein (Morty) and align on second-tier cloud coverage. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ?] Set up a regular 1:1 with Shahar and define cadence. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ?] Reach out to Shahar to plan the Tel Aviv agenda and sub-meetings. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ?] Build a synthesized pipeline and requirements view for Oracle, Microsoft, AWS, and Google, mapping product fit. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ?] Draft a Google TPU partnership strategy and positioning with GCP and neo-clouds. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ?] Obtain an R&D reading list/SOP and review Confluence/docs to deepen product understanding. @Myself #task #proposed
- [ ?] Increase presence on Slack (e.g., pre-sales channel) and engage on cloud deployment threads. @Myself #task #proposed
- [ ?] Set up a 1:1 with Andy Bernstein to learn meeting rhythms and channels. @Myself #task #proposed
- [ ?] Introduce yourself and sync with program managers Liraz, Daphnas, Eyal Tritle, and Noa. @Myself #task #proposed
- [ ?] Join the Supercomputing meeting schedule and add yourself to relevant customer meetings once the roster is available. @Myself #task #proposed
- [ ?] Set a small-group meeting at Supercomputing with Nidhi (and a relevant teammate, e.g., Jack). @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ?] Confirm Brett’s participation/availability for the pricing/consumption discussion. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ?] Coordinate with Rob Benoit on Tech Summit content expectations. @Myself #task #proposed
- [ ?] Validate what Microsoft data can be used in ROI comparisons before sharing with Nidhi. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed

## Decisions
- Do not run an OpenAI alignment session until OpenAI engages.
- Primary focus is Microsoft while simultaneously investing in a Google TPU strategy.
- Lior’s remit is hyperscalers plus sell-to motions; Morty covers second-tier clouds.
- Pricing/consumption discussion must include Brett.

## Key Information
- On-prem average utilization is ~30%, so broad consumption pricing could reduce prepaid revenue and force difficult on-prem conversations.
- Uniform pricing across cloud and on-prem may have advantages if customers commit regardless of deployment location.
- Lior is focused on hyperscalers and also has sell-to obligations (example: Microsoft AI research/MapFalcon ~16,000 GPUs).
- Morty (Mordechai) covers second-tier clouds (e.g., CoreWeave).
- Tech Summit content is led by Rob Benoit (Global Sales Engineering).
- Supercomputing typically has a very large volume of scheduled meetings; technical staff are assigned shortly before the event.
- Tel Aviv trip planning discussed; flight noted as on the 21st, but month not specified in the note.
