# 1:1 with Jeff Denworth, org map, onboarding, and cross-cloud strategy focus

**Date**: 2025-11-07
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jeff Denworth

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Jeff Denworth reviewed the org landscape, clarified key roles and coverage gaps, and aligned Jason's near-term focus on a first-class cross-cloud platform strategy and cloud GTM. They agreed to catalog in-flight opportunities by product requirements, engage directly with field and customers, and use Confluence as the source of record for FRDs and customer requirements.


## Action Items


- [?] Draft cross-cloud product strategy (including Neo clouds) and outline GTM plays for Foundry, Bedrock, and Vertex, then produce v0.1 for feedback. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Catalog in-flight opportunities and map concrete product requirements, then recommend which opportunities to pursue, defer, or drop. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Prepare for the Google RFP (TPU angle) by compiling questions, qualifying scope, and ensuring the workload is not block-I/O latency sensitive. @Myself 📅 2025-11-13 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Create a crisp Microsoft competitive slide highlighting Azure Storage gaps and VAST advantages. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Meet John (alliances) to define a cloud-in-a-box approach and control-plane partner plan, and pull Morty into the follow-up. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Engage with SEs at the Tech Summit in Orlando to gather field insights and build relationships. @Myself 📅 2025-11-13 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Connect with Sagi to understand the pipelines/serverless roadmap and identify cloud packaging gaps. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Document Walmart and other customer requirements and FRDs in Confluence, aligning structure with Alon Horev and Tomer Hagay. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Set up a monthly 1:1 with Renen to align on cloud platform goals and reporting cadence. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Explore the cost model calculator Jeff Denworth shared and provide observations on assumptions and inflection points. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Propose a win/loss analysis cadence and template with Sales Ops and PM, starting next quarter. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

## Decisions


- Carl will move to Professional Services under Rob rather than supporting customer-facing PM work.

- Jason Vallery and Jeff Denworth will set a monthly touchpoint with Brandon to align on cloud platform priorities.

- Customer requirements and FRDs will be authored and maintained in Confluence as the source of record for engineering consumption.

- Jason Vallery will prioritize building a first-class cross-cloud platform strategy and cloud GTM plan rather than chasing ad hoc deals without repeatable packaging.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated that John runs alliances and partnerships at VAST Data and is the go-to contact for AMD and NVIDIA relationships and channel partnerships (non-cloud).

- Jeff Denworth stated that Sagi leads the pipelines product and the serverless layer at VAST Data, and that cloud GTM packaging for pipelines is under-thought (for example, how customers buy runtime, C-nodes, or GPU access in cloud).

- Jeff Denworth stated that Morty currently owns Neo cloud feature requirements and will support Jason Vallery's area but must maintain that existing coverage.

- Jeff Denworth stated that Rob's Customer Success organization at VAST Data functions primarily as support and systems engineering today.

- Jeff Denworth stated that Dima is a deep fixer who can resolve hard problems across the organization.

- Jeff Denworth stated that Daphna and Leeraz handle release planning and program management for VAST Data.

- Jeff Denworth stated that Kristen runs enablement at VAST Data.

- Jeff Denworth stated that Eric is Rick's execution lead at VAST Data.

- Jeff Denworth stated that Confluence is the source of record for customer requirements and FRDs so engineering can consume them consistently.

- Jeff Denworth stated he wants a first-class, homogenized cloud platform strategy across hyperscalers and Neo clouds, rather than ad hoc deal-by-deal approaches.

- Jeff Denworth stated that Carl is a poor customer-facing fit and will be reassigned to Professional Services under Rob.

- Jeff Denworth stated that a Google RFP is likely TPU-oriented and that VAST should ensure the scope is not block-I/O latency sensitive where NetApp is strong.

- Jeff Denworth stated he will be in Orlando Tuesday through Thursday the week after 2025-11-07 for sales strategy, and that SE engagement there is high value for Jason Vallery.

- Jason Vallery stated he is still waiting for a VAST Data laptop and is working from a VM during onboarding.

- Jason Vallery stated he plans to travel the week of Thanksgiving 2025 and return home on Thanksgiving Day.
