# 1:1 with Jeff Denworth, org map, onboarding, and cross-cloud strategy priorities

**Date**: 2025-11-07
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jeff Denworth

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Jeff Denworth reviewed the VAST org landscape, clarified key role owners, and aligned Jason's near-term focus on a first-class cross-cloud platform strategy and cloud-native GTM. They agreed to catalog in-flight opportunities by product requirements, document customer requirements/FRDs in Confluence, and prepare specific near-term deliverables for Google and Microsoft.

## Action Items

- [?] Draft a cross-cloud product strategy (including Neo clouds) and outline cloud GTM plays for Foundry, Bedrock, and Vertex, then share v0.1 for feedback. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Catalog in-flight opportunities and map concrete product requirements, then recommend which opportunities to pursue, defer, or drop. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Prepare for the Google RFP meeting by compiling questions, qualifying scope, and validating the workload is not block I/O latency sensitive. @Myself 📅 2025-11-13 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Create a crisp Microsoft competitive slide highlighting Azure Storage gaps and VAST Data advantages. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Meet John (alliances/partnerships) to define a cloud-in-a-box approach and control-plane partner plan, then pull Morty into a follow-up. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Engage with VAST Data SEs at the Tech Summit in Orlando to gather field insights and build relationships. @Myself 📅 2025-11-13 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Connect with Sagi to understand the pipelines/serverless roadmap and identify cloud packaging gaps. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Document Walmart and other customer requirements and FRDs in Confluence and align the structure with Alon Horev and Tomer Hagay. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Set up a monthly 1:1 with Brandon (last name not stated) to align on cloud platform priorities. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Explore the cost model calculator Jeff Denworth shared and provide observations on assumptions and inflection points. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Propose a win-loss analysis cadence and template with Sales Ops and Product Management, starting next quarter. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm Morty's allocation during the transition to support Jason Vallery's team while maintaining Neo-cloud feature coverage. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Align with Lior Genzel on priority opportunities and ensure Jason Vallery is included in the right customer meetings. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Get Confluence space guidance from Alon Horev and Tomer Hagay for FRDs and customer requirement documents. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Verify Orlando schedules and book onsite time with Jeff Denworth during his Tuesday through Thursday Orlando trip the following week. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Update Jeff Denworth on Microsoft progress once a cohesive narrative is ready. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

## Decisions

- Carl (last name not stated) will move to Professional Services under Rob Banga instead of supporting customer-facing product management work.

- Jason Vallery will set a monthly touchpoint with Brandon (last name not stated) to align on cloud platform priorities.

- Customer requirements and FRDs will be authored and maintained in Confluence as the source of record for engineering consumption.

- Jason Vallery's near-term focus will prioritize architecting a first-class cross-cloud platform strategy and cloud-native GTM over ad hoc deal chasing.

## Key Information

- Jeff Denworth wants VAST Data to have a first-class, homogenized cloud platform strategy across hyperscalers and Neo clouds, rather than ad hoc deal-by-deal execution.

- John (last name not stated) runs alliances and partnerships at VAST Data and is the go-to contact for AMD and NVIDIA relationships and channel partnerships outside of public cloud.

- Sagi (last name not stated) leads the VAST Data pipelines product and the serverless layer; Jeff Denworth believes cloud GTM and packaging for pipelines/serverless is under-thought (for example, how customers buy a runtime, C-nodes, or GPUs in cloud).

- Morty (last name not stated) currently owns Neo-cloud feature requirements and will support Jason Vallery's area while maintaining that existing coverage.

- Rob Banga's customer success organization at VAST Data functions primarily as support and systems engineering today.

- Dima (last name not stated) is described as a deep fixer within VAST Data who can resolve hard problems.

- Daphna (last name not stated) and Leeraz (last name not stated) handle release and program management responsibilities at VAST Data.

- Kristen (last name not stated) runs enablement at VAST Data.

- Eric (last name not stated) is Rick's execution lead at VAST Data.

- Confluence is the source of record at VAST Data for customer requirements and FRDs so engineering can consume them consistently.

- A person named Aaron in Marianne's marketing organization at VAST Data is heavily focused on building pipelines content; Jeff Denworth believes this is an over-rotation and wants to address it directly.

- Idsoc (name as spoken, last name not stated) works on block storage at VAST Data and is considered critical to reaching business critical mass for block storage.

- Jason Vallery was onboarding without a VAST Data laptop and was running in a VM at the time of this meeting.

- Jeff Denworth planned to be in Orlando Tuesday through Thursday the following week for sales strategy, and Jason Vallery planned to engage SEs at a Tech Summit there.

- A Google RFP was expected to be TPU-oriented; the team should qualify scope and ensure the workload is not block I/O latency sensitive where NetApp typically excels.
