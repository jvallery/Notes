# Jeff Denworth flags MAI supply-chain risk and need for immediate plan (no Microsoft inventory reserved)

**Date**: 2025-12-21
**With**: Jeff Denworth, Jason Vallery, Lior Genzel, Renen Hallak, Alon Horev, Shachar Feinblit, Jonsi Stefansson, Rick Scurfield, Manish Sah, Kushal Datta, Kanchan Mehrotra, Qingying Zhang, Jai Menon, Jack Kabat, Kurt Niebuhr, Kushal Datta, Maneesh Sah, Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, Karén Simonyan, Vamshi, Sagar, Anson (Qi), Avery Pham, Vipin

## Summary

Jeff Denworth escalated that VAST is selling out of supply, lead times are increasing, and nothing is reserved for Microsoft, so any MAI deployment target in April-June requires an immediate plan. The thread also identifies MAI decision dynamics (Mustafa is final decision-maker) and a need to build relationships with additional MAI stakeholders beyond Kushal.


## Action Items


- [?] Create an immediate supply and delivery plan for Microsoft MAI deployments targeting April 2026 to June 2026, explicitly accounting for the fact that no VAST inventory is reserved for Microsoft and lead times are increasing. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Send Jeff Denworth the most recent analysis Jason Vallery has on the MAI deal, including implications if Microsoft is buying 100 EB and any working capital or opportunity cost considerations. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Obtain introductions and establish direct communication with Majid Mohammed (Mustafa chief of staff), Yunchao Gong (Kushal Datta's manager), and Karén Simonyan (chief scientist, Mustafa direct report) to build trust and alignment for the MAI storage decision. @Lior Genzel ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Evaluate and recommend the most strategic environment to run Anson (Qi)'s VAST PoC at 1,000-2,000 GPU scale, comparing MAI/Vipin environment versus Nscale and CoreWeave clusters, and align this plan with Kushal Datta's MAI PoC plans. @Lior Genzel ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Alon Horev to strategize options for moving Anson (Qi)'s PoC into a suitable large-GPU environment and to prepare for a requested solution design discussion with Kushal Datta. @Lior Genzel #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Lior Genzel will take the lead on obtaining introductions to key Microsoft MAI stakeholders (Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, Karén Simonyan) to reduce reliance on Kushal Datta as the sole conduit.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated that VAST Data is quickly selling out of supply, lead times are increasing, and there is nothing reserved for Microsoft for the MAI effort.

- Jeff Denworth stated that if Microsoft MAI wants to deploy in April 2026, May 2026, or June 2026, VAST needs a plan immediately due to supply-chain constraints.

- Jason Vallery reported hearing from multiple Azure contacts that the final MAI storage decision is Mustafa's.

- Jason Vallery reported hearing from multiple Azure contacts that Kushal Datta cannot be trusted and may be misrepresenting his influence over Mustafa's decision.

- Jason Vallery stated he has no current relationship with Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, or Karén Simonyan and that Lior Genzel will lead efforts to get introductions.

- Lior Genzel stated that Anson (Qi) requested moving a VAST PoC into either the MAI/Vipin environment or other clusters (Nscale or CoreWeave) because Microsoft labs lack 1,000-2,000 GPUs needed for performance scale testing.

- Jeff Denworth stated that supply chain for the upcoming year is a complete disaster and asked how VAST would source Microsoft's stated 2 EB requirement, including when it must be ordered and from whom.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal Datta said MAI's initial GPU drop will arrive in February 2026 and they need a storage solution ready for the May 2026 to June 2026 timeframe, and that January 2026 is no longer a hard date.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal Datta said MAI will decide on the storage deployment and told Maneesh Sah that Azure Blob does not make sense versus VAST for MAI requirements.

- Lior Genzel reported that Vamshi (Azure Blob product leader) emphasized Microsoft's decision is internal and expressed frustration with VAST's aggressive approach in highlighting Azure Blob deficiencies.

- Jeff Denworth requested that Jason Vallery DM Jeff Denworth Jason's most recent analysis related to the MAI deal and potential 100 EB purchase implications.

- Jeff Denworth stated that Sagar took a job at Nscale and that Sagar had stepped into Nidhi's role after she left.

- Renen Hallak stated that Microsoft should have their own flash allocation with NAND manufacturers and that VAST efficiencies could reduce Microsoft's NAND needs and potentially allow use of Microsoft's excess allocation for other customers.
