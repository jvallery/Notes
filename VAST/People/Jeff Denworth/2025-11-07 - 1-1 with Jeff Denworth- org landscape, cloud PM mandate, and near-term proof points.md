# 1:1 with Jeff Denworth: org landscape, cloud PM mandate, and near-term proof points

**Date**: 2025-11-07
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jeff Denworth

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Jeff Denworth reviewed VAST’s org landscape and key players, aligned on Jason owning multi-cloud strategy end-to-end, and emphasized learning current operations before making changes. They agreed on near-term proof via an Azure “gaps” slide, a win-loss cadence, and deeper embedding with SEs, plus a cautious China posture as a sales outpost rather than an operational hub.


## Action Items


- [?] Set up a 1:1 meeting with John to understand his scope (alliances for conventional channels) and discuss cloud-in-a-box strategy and Tier 2 cloud partnerships, then pull Morty into the conversation. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Reach out to Sagi to connect and understand his work on the Pipelines product and the serverless layer, focusing on implications for cloud packaging. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule time with Morty to onboard him into Jason Vallery’s scope while keeping Morty focused on Neo cloud feature requirements. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Set up monthly 1:1 meetings with Renan to gain additional perspectives on organizational strategy and product strategy. @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Meet with Noah to understand his responsibilities and how they intersect with cloud product requirements and delivery. @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Set up a 1:1 with Ryan and his team regarding database services and the database/data-engine overlay, including how it impacts cloud strategy and packaging. @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Catalog all in-flight opportunities from a product perspective and map deal flow requirements into product requirements and documentation artifacts. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Work with Tomer to learn how to store FRDs/requirements documentation in Confluence and follow the Confluence process. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Create a crisp internal slide quantifying Azure Storage gaps (the “dagger” Azure slide) that can be repeated as a narrative across clouds, using anonymized examples where needed. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Stand up a win-loss cadence and ensure outputs are usable by sales, SEs, and engineering within the month. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Have a conversation with Aaron about being over-rotated on building pipelines and rebalancing focus as needed. @Jeff Denworth #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Text ITSIC regarding block storage and the need to reach critical mass of business. @Jeff Denworth #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Move Carl to ProServe team working for Rob. @TBD #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- VAST Data will treat China as a sales outpost (software-only sales) and avoid significant CAPEX or headcount build-out in China.

- Carl will move to ProServe under Rob’s leadership due to limitations in customer-facing roles.

- VAST Data FRDs and product requirements will be stored in Confluence, and Jason Vallery will follow the Confluence documentation process.

- Morty will remain focused on Neo cloud feature requirements while being onboarded into Jason Vallery’s team scope.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth emphasized that Jason Vallery should understand the current organizational state and operating model before proposing organizational changes.

- Jason Vallery’s mandate from Jeff Denworth is to own VAST Data multi-cloud strategy end-to-end and translate live deal flow into product requirements and Confluence documentation, plus focused cloud plays across Azure, AWS, GCP, and Oracle (including Foundry, Bedrock, and Vertex ecosystems).

- Jeff Denworth expects near-term proof from Jason Vallery via an Azure narrative artifact (a crisp slide quantifying Azure Storage gaps), a win-loss cadence, and embedding with Systems Engineers during and after Tech Summit.

- Jeff Denworth and Jason Vallery aligned that China should be treated as a sales outpost with software-only sales, avoiding significant CAPEX or headcount build-out.

- Jason Vallery shared an operational/technical anecdote from ByteDance: they bypassed Azure Storage by connecting their own data center to Azure via a high-capacity WAN, illustrating China-region operational constraints and workarounds.

- Jeff Denworth stated that FRDs and product requirements should be stored in Confluence and that Jason Vallery should learn and follow the Confluence documentation process.

- Jeff Denworth and Jason Vallery discussed moving Carl to ProServe under Rob’s leadership because Carl was limited in customer-facing roles; they characterized Rob’s organization as operating more like reactive support than proactive Customer Success.

- Jeff Denworth uses Apple Calendar alongside Google Calendar for meeting management.
