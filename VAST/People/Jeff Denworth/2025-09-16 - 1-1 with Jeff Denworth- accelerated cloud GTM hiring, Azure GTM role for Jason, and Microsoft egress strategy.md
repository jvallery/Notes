## Decisions


- Jeff Denworth and Jason Vallery agreed to start VAST Data's interview and recruiting process for Jason Vallery.

- Jeff Denworth and Jason Vallery agreed the initial role focus for Jason Vallery should be Azure go-to-market as a business development and strategic relationship owner, paired with a highly technical counterpart.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth is ramping VAST Data's cloud go-to-market team from a single-person effort to a 10 to 15 person team because VAST has decided to make cloud a top priority and believes product-market feasibility is proven enough to scale execution.

- Jeff Denworth described a target operating model of a 3-person core team per cloud consisting of a sales specialist, a business development lead, and a technical lead.

- Jason Vallery has approximately 13 years at Microsoft Azure and previously spent about 10 years as a software developer before moving into customer-facing roles.

- Jason Vallery stated Azure Storage has roughly 1,600 people across product management and engineering (excluding field and ancillary roles), and he believes Microsoft culture executes slowly at that scale.

- Jason Vallery said he wrote a technical strategy paper about solving AI storage at scale about three years prior to this meeting and cited slow execution at Microsoft as a blocker to moving the needle.

- Jason Vallery said his first meeting with OpenAI was in 2018 and that he led the OpenAI engagement full-time until recently, with multiple people working for him also full-time on OpenAI, and he also supported Microsoft AI and other AI labs at smaller scale.

- Jason Vallery stated the Microsoft-OpenAI relationship shifted from an engineering-to-engineering model to a more enterprise-style relationship with increased finance and legal involvement as OpenAI scaled from about 30 employees to roughly 5,000 employees.

- Jeff Denworth and Jason Vallery aligned that Jason's initial role at VAST Data should be Azure-focused and business-facing, owning strategic relationships, paired with a strong technical counterpart.

- Jeff Denworth raised concern that overly advanced cloud integration discussions can confuse sales specialists and reduce confidence if the organization is still at first-level cloud integration maturity.
