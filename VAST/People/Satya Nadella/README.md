## Recent Context

- 2025-10-22: [[2025-10-22 - Jason shared candid guidance on Microsoft’s approach to GPU capacity preference]] - Weekly 1:1 between Jason Vallery (VAST) and Rosanne Kincaid–Smith (Dhammak Group) covering Microsoft... (via Rosanne Kincaid–Smith)

## Key Facts

- Jason Vallery is on day 3 at VAST, leading product management focused on hybrid scalers and frontier model builders; previously led Microsoft Storage Platform product work supporting AI initiatives and the OpenAI storage relationship.
- Rosanne Kincaid–Smith is based in Dubai and recently joined Dhammak Group to build a vertically integrated GPU/cloud platform; Dhammak acquired nearly 5GW of power and land and targets ~500MW online by early next year with multi-gigawatt expansion across Asia, US, and Europe.
- Microsoft prefers in-house data center builds but uses neo-cloud partnerships to hedge capacity gaps and shift GPU capex risk off Microsoft’s balance sheet.
- Lease pullbacks were described as CFO/balance-sheet risk management; some leases later resumed as demand materialized.
- GPU depreciation modeled at ~5 years is increasingly uncertain due to rapid accelerator roadmaps (e.g., H100 to GB200) and alternative accelerators (TPUs/ASICs/first-party).
- Fiber proximity to hyperscaler hero regions is a key determinant: limited fiber constrains training workloads and pushes sites toward inference-heavy use cases.
- Data gravity is shifting as compute chases power; VAST’s global data namespace is positioned to connect data to distributed compute.
