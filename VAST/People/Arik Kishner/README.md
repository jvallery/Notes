## Key Facts

- Tiffany Stonehill covers AWS and Azure; Olivia Borey covers GCP and OCI.
- Jason Vallery joined as VP of Product Management for Cloud and reports to Jeff Denworth; previously spent 13 years leading Microsoft object storage PM.
- Global namespace is positioned as the key differentiator to move data to where compute runs (on-prem, public cloud, cross-cloud, Neo clouds).
- Supported AWS VM shapes are ~120 TB nodes; Azure is ~23 TB nodes today with discussions for ~300 TB nodes next year.
- Cloud VM cost cited as ~$0.20/GB-month (~20x on-prem hardware cost).
- MVP is an 8-node HA VAST cluster on cloud VMs; same product as on-prem, optimized for ease of deployment and performance.
- Marketplace automation targets: GCP first; Azure and AWS within ~3 months.
- Cloud providers often sponsor POCs; VAST cloud spend can burn down customer cloud commits via marketplace/private offers once GA.
- AWS FSx first-party program is being pursued; more field opportunities help accelerate hyperscaler support.
- Cloud engineering team grew from ~5 to ~25 engineers, increasing velocity.

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Use the VAST on Cloud Slack channel as the primary intake for opportunities; Tiffany (AWS/Azure) and Olivia (GCP/OCI) lead engagement.
- ✅ Proceed with MVP 8-node HA VAST on Cloud clusters via marketplace automation (GCP first; Azure/AWS to follow).
- ✅ Actively pursue hyperscaler programs (e.g., AWS FSx) and larger VM shapes to improve cost/performance.
- ✅ Use Slack channel as the primary route for VAST on Cloud deals and support (Tiffany: AWS/Azure; Olivia: GCP/OCI).
- ✅ Lead with global namespace to enable data to move to compute across on-prem, cloud, and NeoClouds.
- ✅ Proceed with marketplace-based deployment and private offers to enable commit burn-down and smoother fulfillment.
- ✅ Showcase VAST on Cloud demos at Supercomputing to drive awareness and pipeline.
