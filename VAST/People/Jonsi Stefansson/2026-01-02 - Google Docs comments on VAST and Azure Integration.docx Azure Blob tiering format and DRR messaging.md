# Google Docs comments on 'VAST and Azure Integration.docx' (Azure Blob tiering format and DRR messaging)

**Date**: 2026-01-02
**Project**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Jonsi Stefansson

## Summary

Google Docs notification email shows two open comments from Jonsi Stefansson on the document 'VAST and Azure Integration.docx'. The comments question whether cold data tiering should use VAST object format versus native Azure Blob format, and whether the document should more strongly state how VAST DRR/efficiencies mitigate flash supply chain constraints.


## Action Items


- [?] Review 'VAST and Azure Integration.docx' and decide whether the Azure Blob cold tier should be described as using VAST object format (opaque, maximum data reduction) or native Azure Blob format (direct readability and ecosystem accessibility), then update the document accordingly. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Update 'VAST and Azure Integration.docx' to clarify and potentially strengthen the statement about how VAST DRR/efficiencies reduce flash capacity requirements and mitigate flash supply chain constraints and price volatility. @Myself #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Jonsi Stefansson raised a concern that tiering cold data to Azure Blob using VAST object format would not be readable directly from Azure Blob, and suggested reconsidering native Azure Blob format for ecosystem accessibility.

- The document 'VAST and Azure Integration.docx' includes a statement that cold data can be transparently tiered to Azure Blob using either VAST native opaque formats for maximum data reduction or transparent open standard formats for ecosystem accessibility.

- Jonsi Stefansson suggested strengthening the document's messaging to more firmly state that VAST data reduction ratio (DRR) and efficiencies reduce the impact of flash supply constraints and rising prices.
