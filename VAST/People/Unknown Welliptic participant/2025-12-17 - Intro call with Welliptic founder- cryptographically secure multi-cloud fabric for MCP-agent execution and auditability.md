# Intro call with Welliptic founder: cryptographically secure multi-cloud fabric for MCP/agent execution and auditability

**Date**: 2025-12-17
**With**: Jason Vallery, Unknown Welliptic participant

## Summary

Jason Vallery met with an unknown Welliptic participant who described Welliptic's globally distributed, cryptographically secure compute platform for running MCP servers, AI agents, and Web2 apps with fine-grained authorization, observability, and immutable audit logs. Welliptic positions itself as a SaaS fabric spanning AWS, GCP, and Azure, taking on infrastructure, autoscaling, and security for MCP deployments, and optionally integrating with hosted LLM services (Vertex AI, Bedrock, Azure equivalent) or hosting open-source models via vLLM.






## Key Information


- Jason Vallery is based in Colorado and previously spent 13 years at Microsoft, including a period working in Seattle, before joining VAST Data.

- Welliptic is named after mathematician André Weil, whose work in algebraic geometry underpins modern elliptic curve cryptography; the company name references elliptic curves used in Welliptic's systems.

- Welliptic's foundational product is a globally distributed, cryptographically secure compute platform coupled with a virtual sandbox environment for executing applications such as AI agents, MCP servers, and Web2 applications.

- Welliptic positions its platform as a SaaS offering that runs across AWS, GCP, and Azure as one global fabric, using deployments called 'pods' that contain multiple nodes and can be distributed across multiple clouds and regions for resilience to regional or provider outages.

- Welliptic deploys applications as 'applets' on pods, where applets include MCP servers, AI agents, and Web2 applications; Welliptic claims it removes the consumer burden of hosting, autoscaling, and securing MCP infrastructure.

- Welliptic offers a product called 'Icarus', described as a virtual conversational agent that enables natural-language workflows across proprietary systems that expose APIs via MCP connectors (examples mentioned: Snowflake, BigQuery, Aurora, S3, MongoDB, Kafka).

- Welliptic claims its platform provides fine-grained authorization controls for what an agent can do, end-to-end visibility and observability, and immutable audit logs for 'who did what'.

- Welliptic claims cryptographic security that mitigates issues such as prompt poisoning and man-in-the-middle prompt modification attacks by protecting prompts and execution flows.

- Welliptic supports integrating with LLMs offered as services by cloud providers (examples mentioned: Google Vertex AI, Amazon Bedrock, and an Azure equivalent) using bring-your-own-keys, and also mentioned hosting open-source models using vLLM for its own chatbot.

- Welliptic's chatbot uses an identity model where a user's identity is represented as a wallet deployed as a browser plugin; users can store API keys (for example OpenAI keys) in the wallet so Welliptic does not need to see the keys, and the wallet passes keys through for inference API calls.
