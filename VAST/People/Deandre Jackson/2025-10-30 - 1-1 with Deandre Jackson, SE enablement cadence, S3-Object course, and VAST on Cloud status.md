# 1:1 with Deandre Jackson, SE enablement cadence, S3/Object course, and VAST on Cloud status

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**With**: Jason Vallery, Deandre Jackson

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Deandre Jackson held an intro 1:1 focused on SE enablement and how cloud messaging should land with the field. Deandre Jackson described the weekly SE enablement cadence and an S3/Object course he built, and asked where Jason fits in cloud efforts and whether Jason will attend TechSummit. Jason shared his Azure object storage and AI customer background, confirmed TechSummit attendance, and clarified that VAST does not yet have a transactable cloud marketplace offer, with current activity described as private offers with Google and a path to unlock AWS and Azure.


## Action Items


- [?] Send Jason Vallery the S3/Object enablement course link and materials for review. @Deandre Jackson 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Review Deandre Jackson's S3/Object enablement course and provide structured feedback from a cloud object storage PM perspective. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Clarify internal messaging to SEs on current VAST on Cloud status, specifically that there is no transactable marketplace offer today and that current activity is described as private offers with Google with future intent for AWS and Azure (no dates). @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- No explicit decisions were captured in the transcript excerpt; the discussion established intent to share and review Deandre Jackson's S3/Object enablement course and to clarify internal messaging on VAST on Cloud status.




## Key Information


- Deandre Jackson is the Technical Enablement Director at VAST Data and currently has two direct reports, with two additional hires in progress; the two current team members joined within the prior two months (relative to 2025-10-30).

- Deandre Jackson runs a weekly SE enablement call that alternates between technical sales upskilling and leadership or field updates, and includes 10-minute segments on competitors and pitching or messaging techniques.

- Jason Vallery spent about 10 years as a software developer and then joined Microsoft during early Azure, working on Azure object storage; he later ran product management for object storage with a focus on AI customers including OpenAI.

- Jason Vallery reports to Jeff Denworth and owns product management for VAST Data Cloud and frontier model builder customers, and is partnering with a recently started colleague named Yonce (full name not captured).

- Jason Vallery stated that VAST Data does not have a generally available, transactable 'VAST on Cloud' offering today and described it as a roadmap journey; he referenced private offers with Google and an intent to unlock AWS and Azure in the future (no dates provided).

- Deandre Jackson observed that some VAST SEs are reluctant to discuss features they have not personally used, and he attributed part of this to a perception that code delivery is often late, which reduces confidence in discussing roadmap items.

- Deandre Jackson created an S3 course for object storage enablement and planned to send it to Jason Vallery for review and feedback.
