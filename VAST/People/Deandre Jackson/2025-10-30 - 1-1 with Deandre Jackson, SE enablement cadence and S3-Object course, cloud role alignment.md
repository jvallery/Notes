# 1:1 with Deandre Jackson, SE enablement cadence and S3/Object course, cloud role alignment

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**With**: Jason Vallery, Deandre Jackson

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Deandre Jackson met 1:1 to align on how cloud enablement should work for the SE org. Deandre Jackson described the weekly SE enablement cadence and an S3/Object course he built, and asked where Jason fits in VAST cloud efforts and whether Jason will attend TechSummit. Jason shared his Azure object storage and AI customer background, clarified current VAST cloud transactability status, and requested SE and customer feedback on cloud blockers and target workloads.


## Action Items


- [?] Send Jason Vallery the S3/Object enablement course link and materials for review. @Deandre Jackson 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Review Deandre Jackson's S3/Object enablement course and provide structured feedback (gaps, accuracy, scenario coverage, and how to message cloud status safely). @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Collect and share SE and customer feedback on blockers to selling and delivering VAST on cloud, and the top desired initial workloads to prioritize. @Deandre Jackson 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Anchor SE enablement for cloud and object storage around workload and sales scenarios (for example, S3/Object scenarios) rather than only generic feature walkthroughs.




## Key Information


- Deandre Jackson is the Technical Enablement Director at VAST Data and currently has two direct reports, with two additional hires planned; the two current team members joined within the prior two months and are ramping.

- Deandre Jackson runs a weekly SE call that alternates between technical sales upskilling and leadership or field updates, and includes 10-minute segments on competitors and pitching mindset.

- Jason Vallery previously worked at Microsoft Azure on the object storage team, owning APIs and SDKs early and later running product management for object storage with a focus on AI customers including OpenAI.

- Jason Vallery reports to Jeff Denworth at VAST Data and owns product management for VAST cloud and frontier model builders, including platform evolution, sales motions, go-to-market, and pricing models for a VAST on cloud experience.

- Deandre Jackson stated that SEs are cautious about discussing features they have not personally used, and that historical code delivery lateness has contributed to this reluctance.

- Deandre Jackson created an S3/Object enablement course and wants Jason Vallery to review it to ensure the content aligns with cloud and object storage realities and does not miss key points.

- Jason Vallery confirmed he registered for and will attend VAST TechSummit.

- Jason Vallery said the technical leads supporting cloud product management were not finalized as of 2025-10-30.
