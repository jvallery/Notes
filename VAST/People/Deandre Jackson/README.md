## Profile

**Role**: Technical Enablement Director at VAST (Enablement (SE enablement))
**Relationship**: Internal cross-functional partner; Jason's 1:1 counterpart for SE enablement and cloud messaging alignment

**Background**:
- Runs SE enablement; owns a weekly SE call cadence alternating technical sales upskilling and leadership/field updates, with short competitive/pitch segments.

## Key Facts

- Dre Jackson is Technical Enablement Director; team recently added 2 heads and is hiring 2 more.
- Dre runs a weekly SE call alternating technical sales upskilling and leadership/field updates, with 10-minute competitive/pitch segments.
- Jason Vallery is ex-Microsoft Azure object storage PM; supported OpenAI; now owns PM for VAST cloud and frontier model builders.
- There is no transactable VAST cloud marketplace yet; current motion is private offers with Google with a roadmap to enable AWS and Azure.
- GPU scarcity at hyperscalers prioritizes first-party (OpenAI/Microsoft) ahead of third-party customers, gating near-term 3P cloud opportunities.
- Dre created a multi-part S3/Object course (fundamentals, sales scenarios; deep-dive WIP) and wants feedback.
- Jeff’s vision: VAST on Cloud as a SaaS overlaying CSP object capacity with VAST performance and RDMA to GPUs.
- MinIO often wins on price for low-cost object workloads; VAST should focus on performance/workload-qualified scenarios.
- Current selling guidance is to avoid sub-500TB deals; Dre questions whether this misses earlier enterprise growth.
- SEs are cautious discussing unreleased features; perceived code lateness impacts confidence and willingness to message roadmap.
