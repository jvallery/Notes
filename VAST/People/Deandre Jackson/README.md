## Profile

**Role**: Technical Enablement Director at VAST Data (Enablement (SE enablement))
**Relationship**: Internal collaborator; 1:1 counterpart

**Background**:
- Runs SE enablement cadence; weekly SE call alternating technical sales upskilling and leadership updates; created a multi-part S3/Object course (fundamentals + sales scenarios; deep-dive WIP). Team recently added 2 people and is hiring 2 more.
- Provided Tech Summit logistics updates (agenda email, hotel confirmations, evening events) and owned multiple event-related follow-ups.
- Named as a key internal contact to engage; part of weekly rhythm list.

## Key Facts

- Deandre Jackson is Technical Enablement Director; team recently added 2 heads and is hiring 2 more.
- Weekly SE call alternates technical sales upskilling and leadership updates, with 10-minute competitive/pitch segments.
- Jason Vallery is ex-Microsoft Azure object storage PM; supported OpenAI; now owns PM for VAST cloud and frontier model builders and reports to Jeff Denworth.
- No transactable VAST cloud marketplace today; current path is private offers with Google; roadmap aims to unlock AWS/Azure.
- GPU scarcity at hyperscalers limits near-term third-party cloud opportunities; OpenAI and Microsoft first-party are prioritized.
- Dre built a multi-part S3/Object course (fundamentals + sales scenarios; deep-dive WIP) and requested feedback.
- Jeff’s vision described: VAST on Cloud as a SaaS overlay using CSP object capacity with VAST performance and RDMA to GPUs.
- MinIO often wins on price for low-cost object workloads; VAST should focus on performance-qualified workloads.
- Current selling guidance mentioned: avoid sub-500TB deals; Dre questions whether this misses earlier enterprise growth.
- SEs are cautious discussing unreleased features; perceived code lateness reduces confidence.

## Topics

SE enablement cadence and curriculum design (S3/Object), VAST cloud status and internal messaging (marketplace vs private offers), Workload-centric selling vs feature-centric object discussions, GPU scarcity and hyperscaler prioritization dynamics, Competitive positioning vs MinIO and qualification guidance, TechSummit attendance and coordination, Cloud alignment and synthesized pipeline/requirements across major clouds, Microsoft prioritization and ROI narrative, Google TPU partnership strategy and competitive positioning vs Google first-party storage, OpenAI engagement timing and deferring alignment, Pricing/consumption model vs prepaid commitments; on-prem utilization risk, Org structure changes and meeting cadence/1:1s, Slack presence and internal channels (pre-sales, cloud deployment threads), Tech Summit content ownership and expectations, Supercomputing meeting planning and small-group with Nidhi

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Anchor enablement on workload scenarios rather than generic object features.
- ✅ Avoid engaging in price-only competitions (e.g., MinIO) unless the workload merits VAST’s performance/value.
- ✅ Do not run an OpenAI alignment session until OpenAI engages.
- ✅ Primary focus is Microsoft while simultaneously investing in a Google TPU strategy.
- ✅ Lior Genzel focuses on hyperscalers and also has sell-to obligations; Mordechai Blaunstein covers second-tier clouds.
- ✅ Pricing/consumption discussion must include Brett.
- ✅ Introduce an SE Toolbox segment approximately monthly.
- ✅ Set Tech Summit evening events: Day 1 reception, Day 2 OPA tavern, Day 3 Sportsplex gaming event with prizes.
- ✅ Enforce strict no-expense policy outside official Tech Summit events.
- ✅ SEs own driving UserCon attendance by working with AEs and customers.
