# Sam Hopewell

## Key Facts

- Sam Hopewell is the primary storage owner for OpenAI research.

- The OpenAI VAST POC is on hold due to bandwidth firefighting and internal decision backlog while the team focuses on bringing new research supercomputer capacity online; there is internal pressure to complete it because it increases GPU fleet fungibility and research capacity, and Sam Hopewell is short staffed and actively hiring.

- Sam Hopewell indicated OpenAI is exploring building its own global namespace and expects to manage its own global state due to a converged layer with multiple clusters and cloud object stores on top.
