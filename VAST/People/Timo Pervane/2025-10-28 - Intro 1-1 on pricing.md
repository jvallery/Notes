# Intro 1:1 on pricing

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Account**: [[Timo Pervane]]
**Attendees**: Timo Pervane, Jason Vallery

## Summary

Introductory 1:1 between Jason and Timo covering backgrounds and finance org context, with emphasis on Cloud Solutions strategy and the need to evolve pricing. They aligned on exploring a unit-based pricing model tied to ARR-focused investor metrics, improving discount discipline, and using finance analytics to support internal alignment with founders.
## Action Items
- [ ?] Draft a unit-based pricing proposal (with Databricks/Snowflake references) including ARR impact modeling and discount guardrails. @Myself 📅 2025-10-28 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ?] Share investor valuation framework and metrics (how ARR is defined/measured and implications for Cloud Solutions). @Timo Pervane 📅 2025-10-28 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ?] Provide current pricing/discounting analysis (price-paid scatter by cohort) to inform normalization plan. @Timo Pervane 📅 2025-10-28 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ?] Define discounting policy and controls to prevent deal-level leakage when cloud SKUs are undiscountable. @Timo Pervane 📅 2025-10-28 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ?] Progress hiring of Finance Business Partner for Cloud Solutions and embed them with the Cloud Solutions leadership team. @Timo Pervane 📅 2025-10-28 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ?] Identify and prioritize exabyte-scale customers to pursue hyperscaler hardware commitments and escalation path. @Myself 📅 2025-10-28 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ?] Align messaging with finance to brief Brennan and Jeff on the pricing evolution rationale and ARR impact. @Myself 📅 2025-10-28 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ?] Schedule a deep-dive session on business metrics and ARR framework. @Myself 📅 2025-10-28 #task #proposed
- [ ?] Send pricing scatter/discounting data set and initial insights. @Timo Pervane 📅 2025-10-28 #task #proposed
- [ ?] Update on finance business partner hiring status after Renan interview. @Timo Pervane 📅 2025-10-28 🔽 #task #proposed

## Key Information
- Timo leads Corporate Finance (FP&A, planning, IR, corp dev) and joined ~11 months prior under CFO Amy Shapiro.
- Finance bandwidth is constrained; Amy is the first CFO and the company is ~1100 people.
- Finance is hiring a dedicated finance business partner for Cloud Solutions; candidate from a hyperscaler interviewed by Yancey and meeting Renan later that week.
- Boston hub has ~40–45 employees including Eric Wolfie, Marian Budnick, Jason Ainsworth, and Joe Stevens.
- Investor valuation lens for the next ~3 years is a growth-adjusted ARR multiple.
- Current pricing is $/TB historically with $/compute added mid-Q2; discounting discipline is poor with wide price dispersion.
- Pricing inconsistency creates customer backlash and contraction risk; risk of deal-level discount leakage if cloud SKUs are undiscountable.
- Jason’s Cloud Solutions strategy: move beyond VM-limited marketplace offerings, target exabyte-scale customers to unlock hyperscaler hardware, and build a common data namespace across on-prem, multi-cloud, and neo-clouds.
- Unit-based pricing could normalize pricing across storage/compute and on-prem/cloud and ease migration to a new model.
