**Date**: 2025-10-28
**With**: Jason Vallery, Timo Pervane

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Timo Pervane did an introductory 1:1 to align on Cloud Solutions priorities, finance coverage, and pricing strategy. Timo described constrained finance bandwidth and an active search for a dedicated Cloud Solutions finance business partner, while both aligned on exploring unit-based pricing and stronger discount discipline tied to ARR-focused investor metrics.

## Key Information

- Timo Pervane leads Corporate Finance at VAST Data, covering corporate FP&A, annual planning, long-range planning, investor relations, and corporate development.

- Timo Pervane joined VAST Data about 11 months before 2025-10-28 and joined under CFO Amy Shapiro, who had been at VAST Data about a year and a month by that date.

- Timo Pervane previously worked with Amy Shapiro for 15-16 years and joined her at Shopify as a business unit CFO before joining VAST Data.

- Timo Pervane is based in the Boston area and said the Boston hub has roughly 40-45 VAST Data employees, including Marian Budnick (CMO), Jason Ainsworth (Chief Accounting Officer), and Joe Stevens (runs data).

- Timo Pervane described VAST Data finance coverage as bandwidth-constrained, noting Amy Shapiro is the first CFO and the company is about 1,100 people, with G&A functions historically minimal compared to product and sales focus.

- Timo Pervane is hiring a dedicated finance business partner for Cloud Solutions; the candidate currently works at a hyperscaler, has met with Yancey (last name not stated), and was scheduled to interview with Renan (last name not stated) later that week.

- Timo Pervane stated the investor lens for the next roughly three years is a growth-adjusted ARR multiple.

- The meeting notes state VAST Data pricing has historically been $/TB and added $/compute in mid-Q2 (year not specified), and discount discipline is poor with wide price dispersion, creating risk of customer backlash and contraction due to peer comparisons.

- Jason Vallery shared a Cloud Solutions strategy to move beyond VM-limited marketplace offerings, pursue exabyte-scale customers to unlock hyperscaler hardware commitments, help address Azure control plane challenges, and build a common data namespace across on-prem, multi-cloud, and neo-cloud environments.

- Jason Vallery and Timo Pervane discussed exploring a unit-based pricing model ("VAST units") to normalize pricing across storage and compute and across on-prem and cloud, and to ease migration to a new pricing model.
