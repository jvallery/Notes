## Summary

## Decisions


- Brian Evans approved RFE 0526 for submission to the VAST PM team.




## Key Information


- Brian Evans approved RFE 0526 (Existing Feature Enhancement) submitted to the VAST PM team for Cisco.

- Jeff Mohler is the Sales Engineer associated with RFE 0526 for Cisco.

- Cisco manages many global sites with data replication and has hundreds of replication relationships, driving the need for name-based filtering in replication policies.

- RFE 0526 requests the ability to use regex patterns to allow or deny files/objects by name in a replication policy, for example allow only *.LIB and deny *.mp3.

- RFE 0526 is not marked as a deal blocker and is associated with an opportunity amount of $0, with an estimated additional capacity impact of 100 PB.

- The value proposition for RFE 0526 is enterprise multi-geo liability protection by preventing replication of certain content (for example copyrighted user content) using 'never replicate' patterns.
