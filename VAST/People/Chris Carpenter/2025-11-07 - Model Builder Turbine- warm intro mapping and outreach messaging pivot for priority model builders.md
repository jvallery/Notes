# Model Builder Turbine: warm intro mapping and outreach messaging pivot for priority model builders

**Date**: 2025-11-07
**Attendees**: Jason Vallery, Chris Carpenter, Jeff Edwards, Erik, Rick Scurfield, Jay Sutton, John, Alon Horev, Renen, Glenn Lockwood, Christian Gibson, David Klein, Henry Perez, Aaron Batillo, Daniel Levy, David Holz, Grant Lee, Robert Brooks

## Summary

Internal working session to map warm introduction paths into priority model builders for the Model Builder Turbine effort, using LinkedIn mutuals, investor networks, and NVIDIA and NeoCloud contacts. The team aligned to shift messaging from generic platform narratives to concrete AI pipeline components (for example, scalable Kafka for RL and a real-time vector database) and to target data and pipeline owners in addition to executives. Owners were assigned to pursue specific intros, plan an NVIDIA-customer AI Circle event as a neutral intro mechanism, and audit prior CRM history before re-engaging certain accounts.

## Decisions

- Reframe Model Builder Turbine outreach to lead with concrete AI pipeline components (for example, scalable Kafka for reinforcement learning workflows and a real-time vector database) rather than generic platform or 'AI OS' narratives.

- Use an AI Circle event with NVIDIA customers as the primary mechanism to facilitate NVIDIA-related introductions, because 1:1 introductions from NVIDIA representatives are expected to be unlikely.

- Broaden persona targeting for model builder outreach to include data and pipeline owners in addition to CTO and executive contacts to increase entry points and bottom-up sponsorship.

- Defer direct introduction paths that create hyperscaler conflicts (Microsoft or Google) when conflicts exist, to reduce risk of undermining warm introductions.

- Reframe Model Builder Turbine outreach to lead with concrete AI pipeline components (for example, scalable Kafka for reinforcement learning and a real-time vector database) rather than generic platform narratives to improve resonance with model builder technical buyers.

- Use an AI Circle event with NVIDIA customers as the primary mechanism to facilitate NVIDIA-related introductions to model builders, because direct 1:1 intros from NVIDIA representatives are unlikely.

- Defer or avoid introduction paths that create hyperscaler conflicts (for example, Google or Microsoft conflicts) when those conflicts could undermine willingness to introduce or participate.

## Key Information

- Chris Carpenter was hired to focus on model builders and the ecosystem around NeoClouds, and previously worked at AI21 Labs with a background spanning machine learning, data science, and AI sales for about 10 years.

- Jason Vallery joined VAST Data from Microsoft after 13 years in Azure Storage, focused on Azure object storage, and owned the storage relationship with OpenAI while at Microsoft.

- The Model Builder Turbine working session goal was to brute-force warm introduction paths into priority model builders using LinkedIn mutuals, investor links, and NVIDIA and NeoCloud contacts.

- The team agreed to shift outreach messaging from generic 'AI OS/platform' narratives to concrete pipeline components, specifically scalable Kafka for reinforcement learning workflows and a real-time vector database.

- The team agreed to target data and pipeline owners (functional buyers) in addition to CTO and executive personas to increase entry points into model builder accounts.

- Thinking Machines intro path identified: Glenn Lockwood as connector to Mile Ott (AI/infra) and Christian Gibson.

- Reflection intro path identified: Giannis as target contact, with a connector via Robert Brooks at Lambda.

- Perplexity intro targets identified: Kevin Wu, Tony Wu, and Noah Yonick, with Grant Lee as a possible connector.

- SSI (Safe Superintelligence Inc.) target contact identified: Daniel Levy, and Alon Horev has prior touchpoints with SSI and was asked for a quick read on other SSI contacts he met.

- Cohere target contact identified as Phil (acting CTO, UK) and Magic target contact identified as Eric (CEO), with Aaron Batillo at CoreWeave as a connector for both.

- Midjourney target identified: founder David Holz, with a possible connector path via Henry Perez at Google.

- NVIDIA intro strategy: pursue introductions primarily through an event-based mechanism (AI Circle event with NVIDIA customers) because 1:1 direct intros from NVIDIA reps are unlikely; Rory was identified as a path to NVIDIA rep David Klein for select accounts.

- The team noted that some warm-intro threads were cooling (example: Zara thread) and that hyperscaler conflicts (Microsoft or Google) could limit willingness to introduce or participate.

- The team agreed to reframe outreach messaging toward concrete AI pipeline components such as scalable Kafka for reinforcement learning and a real-time vector database, rather than generic 'AI OS' or platform narratives.

- The team agreed to target data and pipeline owners in addition to CTO and executive personas to increase entry points for pilots and evaluations at model builder companies.

- NVIDIA introductions to model builders were expected to be more feasible via an event-based mechanism (AI Circle with NVIDIA customers) than via direct 1:1 introductions from NVIDIA representatives.
