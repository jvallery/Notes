# Warm intro paths planning

**Date**: 2025-11-07
**With**: Jason Vallery, Chris Carpenter, Jeff Edwards, Erik, Rick Scurfield, Jay Sutton, John, Alon, Renen

## Summary

Working session to identify warm-intro paths into priority model builders using LinkedIn mutuals, investor vectors, and NVIDIA/NeoCloud contacts. The group aligned to shift outreach messaging toward concrete data/pipeline components (e.g., scalable Kafka for RL, real-time vector DB) and to target data/pipeline owners in addition to execs. They also agreed to advance an AI Circle event with NVIDIA customers as a more realistic mechanism for NVIDIA-facilitated introductions.
## Action Items
- [ ] Follow up with Glenn Lockwood for an intro to Mile Ott and Christian Gibson at Thinking Machines. @Chris Carpenter 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task #proposed
- [ ] Ask Jay to set a sit-down with Robert Brooks (Lambda) to connect to Giannis at Reflection. @Jeff Denworth Edwards 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task #proposed
- [ ] Reach out to Henry Perez (Google) to assess a path to Midjourney and appropriateness for intros. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ] Ping Alon for SSI contacts (including Daniel Levy) and a quick read on other SSI contacts he met. @Chris Carpenter 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ] Ask Grant Lee for an intro to Noah Yonick or Kevin/Tony Wu at Perplexity. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ] Engage Aaron Batillo (CoreWeave) for intros to Phil (Cohere) and Eric (Magic). @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task #proposed
- [ ] Coordinate with AI Circle, Katie, and Lindsay to plan an NVIDIA-customer model builder event. @Chris Carpenter 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ] Work with the pipelines team to draft outreach assets focused on scalable Kafka for RL and a real-time vector DB. @Chris Carpenter 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task #proposed
- [ ] Audit Salesforce histories for Midjourney and SSI before renewed outreach. @Chris Carpenter 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed
- [ ] Ask Rory to introduce NVIDIA rep David Klein for a path to He2. @Chris Carpenter 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ] Engage Bond to pursue an intro to Yuri at Physical Intelligence. @Jeff Denworth Edwards 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ] Research Black Forest Labs and ping the founder to assess fit and timing. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed
- [ ] Re-ping investor thread with Jeff Yonker and Bo Wang at Zara to secure a meeting slot. @Jeff Denworth Edwards 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ] Confirm with NVIDIA (via Katie) whether customer intros will occur primarily via events and align event timing. @Chris Carpenter 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ] Confirm NVIDIA contact details for David Klein with Rory and align on next steps. @Chris Carpenter 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed

## Decisions
- Reframe outreach to focus on concrete pipeline components (e.g., scalable Kafka for RL, real-time vector DB) rather than generic platform narratives.
- Use an AI Circle NVIDIA-customer event as the primary mechanism for NVIDIA-facilitated introductions; 1:1 intros from NVIDIA reps are unlikely.
- Broaden persona targeting to include data/pipeline owners in addition to CTO/exec-level contacts.
- Defer direct Google/Microsoft-introduced paths where hyperscaler conflicts exist to reduce risk and friction.

## Key Information
- Primary goal was to brute-force warm intro paths into priority model builders using LinkedIn mutuals, investor links, and NVIDIA/NeoCloud contacts.
- Targets discussed included Thinking Machines, Reflection, Physical Intelligence, Midjourney, SSI (Safe Superintelligence Inc.), Perplexity, Cohere, Magic, Anthropic, and Apple.
- Thinking Machines: Mile Ott and Christian Gibson identified as key contacts; Glenn Lockwood is a potential connector.
- Reflection: Giannis identified as key infra/compute contact; Robert Brooks (Lambda) is a connector path.
- Perplexity: Kevin Wu, Tony Wu, and Noah Yonick identified as targets; Grant Lee is a potential connector.
- SSI: Daniel Levy identified as a key contact; Alon has prior touchpoints; OpenAI-based intro paths considered unlikely due to conflicts.
- Midjourney: founder David Holz identified; Henry Perez (Google) considered as a possible connector.
- NVIDIA: David Klein identified as a rep; expectation is event-based intros rather than direct 1:1 introductions.
- Some warm-intro threads were cooling (e.g., Zara), and hyperscaler conflicts may limit certain intro paths.
