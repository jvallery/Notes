# Warm intros and outreach planning for priority model builders (LinkedIn, investors, NVIDIA, NeoClouds)

**Date**: 2025-11-07
**Project**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Jason Vallery, Chris Carpenter, Jeff Edwards, Erik, Rick Scurfield, Jay Sutton, John, Alon Horev, Renen

## Summary

Internal working session to map warm introduction paths into priority model builders for the Model Builder Turbine effort, using LinkedIn mutuals, investor networks, and NVIDIA and NeoCloud contacts. The team aligned to shift messaging from generic platform narratives to concrete AI pipeline components (for example, scalable Kafka for RL and a real-time vector database) and to target data and pipeline owners in addition to executives. Owners were assigned to pursue specific intros, plan an NVIDIA-customer AI Circle event as a neutral intro mechanism, and audit prior CRM history before re-engaging certain accounts.


## Action Items


- [?] Follow up with Glenn Lockwood to request an introduction to Mile Ott and Christian Gibson at Thinking Machines. @Chris Carpenter 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Ask Jay Sutton to set a sit-down with Robert Brooks (Lambda) to create a connection path to Giannis at Reflection. @Jeff Edwards 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Reach out to Henry Perez (Google) to assess a warm path to Midjourney and whether an introduction is appropriate. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Ping Alon Horev for SSI contacts including Daniel Levy and a quick read on other SSI contacts Alon Horev has met. @Chris Carpenter 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Ask Grant Lee for an introduction to Noah Yonick or Kevin Wu and Tony Wu at Perplexity. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Engage Aaron Batillo (CoreWeave) for introductions to Phil (acting CTO, UK) at Cohere and Eric (CEO) at Magic. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with AI Circle plus Katie and Lindsay to plan an NVIDIA-customer model builder event to create neutral ground for introductions. @Chris Carpenter 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Work with the pipelines team to draft outreach assets focused on scalable Kafka for reinforcement learning and a real-time vector database. @Chris Carpenter 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Audit Salesforce histories for Midjourney and SSI before renewed outreach to avoid duplicative or conflicting engagement. @Chris Carpenter 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Ask Rory to introduce NVIDIA representative David Klein for a path to the account referred to as 'He2'. @Chris Carpenter 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Engage Bond to pursue an introduction to Yuri at Physical Intelligence. @Jeff Edwards 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Research Black Forest Labs and contact the founder to assess fit and timing as a potential additional model builder target. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Re-ping the investor thread with Jeff Yonker and Bo Wang at Zara to secure a meeting slot and revive a cooling outreach thread. @Jeff Edwards 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm with NVIDIA via Katie whether customer introductions will occur primarily via events and align event timing accordingly. @Chris Carpenter 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm NVIDIA contact details for David Klein with Rory and align on next steps for introductions. @Chris Carpenter 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Reframe Model Builder Turbine outreach to lead with concrete AI pipeline components (for example, scalable Kafka for reinforcement learning and a real-time vector database) rather than generic platform narratives to improve resonance with model builder technical buyers.

- Use an AI Circle event with NVIDIA customers as the primary mechanism to facilitate NVIDIA-related introductions to model builders, because direct 1:1 intros from NVIDIA representatives are unlikely.

- Broaden persona targeting for model builder outreach to include data and pipeline owners in addition to CTO and executive contacts to increase entry points and bottom-up sponsorship.

- Defer or avoid introduction paths that create hyperscaler conflicts (for example, Google or Microsoft conflicts) when those conflicts could undermine willingness to introduce or participate.




## Key Information


- Chris Carpenter was hired to focus on model builders and the ecosystem around NeoClouds, and previously worked at AI21 Labs with a background spanning machine learning, data science, and AI sales for about 10 years.

- Jason Vallery joined VAST Data from Microsoft after 13 years in Azure Storage focused on object storage, and worked with model builders on Azure including owning the storage relationship with OpenAI.

- The Model Builder Turbine working session used LinkedIn mutual connections, investor links, and NVIDIA and NeoCloud contacts to create warm introduction paths into priority model builder accounts.

- The team agreed to reframe outreach messaging toward concrete AI pipeline components such as scalable Kafka for reinforcement learning and a real-time vector database, rather than generic 'AI OS' or platform narratives.

- The team agreed to target data and pipeline owners in addition to CTO and executive personas to increase entry points for pilots and evaluations at model builder companies.

- NVIDIA introductions to model builders were expected to be more feasible via an event-based mechanism (AI Circle with NVIDIA customers) than via direct 1:1 introductions from NVIDIA representatives.
