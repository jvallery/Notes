# Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman meeting summary, Whale Iptic secure compute platform and potential VAST integration

**Date**: 2025-12-17
**With**: Myself, Avinash Lakshman

## Summary

Avinash Lakshman presented Whale Iptic's globally distributed secure compute platform (Icarus conversational agent and Cerebrum SDK) with multi-cloud pods and a distributed ledger for data sovereignty and fault tolerance. Jason Vallery discussed VAST Data storage for AI training and model distribution and explored potential integration with GPU infrastructure and distributed ledger technology for secure, verifiable agent execution. Next step is for Jason to send Avinash public links and information about VAST capabilities for Avinash to review and propose alignment ideas.


## Action Items


- [?] Send Avinash Lakshman a follow-up email with public links and information about VAST Data's current and upcoming capabilities (avoid sharing internal-only roadmap details). @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Review the VAST Data public information sent by Jason Vallery and propose how Whale Iptic's platform could integrate with or align to VAST Data's product direction. @Avinash Lakshman #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Jason Vallery will send Avinash Lakshman a follow-up email with public links and information about VAST Data's current and upcoming capabilities for evaluation.




## Key Information


- Avinash Lakshman presented Whale Iptic's platform as a globally distributed compute platform with virtual sandbox environments for AI agents and Web2 applications.

- Whale Iptic's offerings include Icarus (a conversational agent) and Cerebrum (an SDK for a trust-aware agent orchestrator with fine-grained authorization and auditability).

- Whale Iptic demonstrated a multi-pod architecture running across AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure to reduce risk from single cloud provider outages.

- Whale Iptic uses a distributed ledger system intended to provide data sovereignty and fault tolerance across cloud regions using custom Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms.

- Avinash Lakshman demonstrated a secure and auditable interaction model using digital signatures and identity-based wallets in the browser, positioning it as providing more auditability than traditional TLS-only approaches.

- Jason Vallery described VAST Data's vision to move up the value stack by combining VAST storage with an AI agent engine for enterprises with data lakes in hyperscalers and GPUs distributed across multiple neoclouds.

- Jason Vallery stated that VAST Data provides storage used for AI training data and model distribution for large language models, and cited customers including xAI, Tesla, and CoreWeave (customer claims should be verified before external use).

- Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman discussed integrating GPU infrastructure with distributed ledger technology to enable secure, verifiable, and observable agent execution in a global state scenario.

- Avinash Lakshman requested public information on VAST Data's current development status, and Jason Vallery agreed to provide it via follow-up email.
