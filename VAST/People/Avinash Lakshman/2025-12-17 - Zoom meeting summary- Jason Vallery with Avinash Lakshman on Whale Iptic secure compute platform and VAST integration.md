# Zoom meeting summary: Jason Vallery with Avinash Lakshman on Whale Iptic secure compute platform and VAST integration

**Date**: 2025-12-17
**With**: Myself, Avinash Lakshman

## Summary

Avinash Lakshman presented Whale Iptic's globally distributed secure compute platform (Icarus agent and Cerebrum SDK) and a demo focused on auditable, identity-based interactions. Jason Vallery and Avinash discussed potential integration areas between VAST storage, GPU infrastructure across neoclouds, and distributed ledger technology for secure, verifiable agent execution. Next step is for Jason to send Avinash public links and information about VAST capabilities for Avinash to review and respond with integration ideas.


## Action Items


- [?] Send Avinash Lakshman a follow-up email with public links and information about VAST Data's current and upcoming capabilities, focused on potential integration with Whale Iptic's secure compute and distributed ledger platform. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Review the VAST Data public information sent by Jason Vallery and propose how Whale Iptic's platform (Icarus and Cerebrum) could integrate with or align to VAST Data's roadmap, then follow up with ideas or a proposal. @Avinash Lakshman #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Jason Vallery will send Avinash Lakshman a follow-up email with public links and information about VAST Data's current and upcoming capabilities for evaluation.




## Key Information


- Avinash Lakshman presented Whale Iptic's platform as a globally distributed compute platform with virtual sandbox environments for AI agents and Web2 applications.

- Whale Iptic's offerings include Icarus (a conversational agent that can interact with enterprise-grade systems) and Cerebrum (an SDK for a trust-aware agent orchestrator with fine-grained authorization and auditability).

- Whale Iptic uses a multi-pod architecture across AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure to reduce the risk of service disruption from a single cloud provider outage.

- Whale Iptic described a distributed ledger system intended to provide data sovereignty and fault tolerance across cloud regions using custom Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms.

- Avinash Lakshman demonstrated a secure LLM management platform that hosts MCP servers and manages LLMs via cloud provider services, emphasizing auditable interactions using digital signatures and identity-based wallets in the browser.

- Jason Vallery raised a concern about whether a browser agent is necessary for security in Whale Iptic's approach, and Avinash Lakshman stated the browser agent is minimal and focused on identity management.

- Jason Vallery described VAST Data's vision to move up the value stack by combining VAST's storage platform with an AI agent engine to serve enterprises with data lakes in hyperscalers and GPUs spread across multiple neoclouds.

- Jason Vallery stated VAST Data provides storage solutions used for training data and model distribution for large language models, and mentioned deployments for companies including xAI, Tesla, and CoreWeave (as stated in the Zoom AI summary, accuracy should be verified).

- Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman discussed an opportunity for VAST Data to provide a 'neocloud in a box' solution for newer cloud providers with varying maturity levels.

- Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman discussed integrating GPU infrastructure with distributed ledger technology to enable secure, verifiable, and observable agent execution in a global state scenario.

- Avinash Lakshman requested public information on VAST Data's current development status, and Jason Vallery agreed to provide it via follow-up email.
