# Intro call with Welliptic (Whale Chain) on cryptographically secure agent/MCP hosting and auditability

**Date**: 2025-12-17
**With**: Jason Vallery, Avinash Lakshman

## Summary

Introductory discussion focused on Welliptic's "Whale Chain" platform, a globally distributed, cryptographically secure compute fabric for hosting MCP servers, AI agents, and Web2 applets across AWS, Azure, and GCP. The Welliptic participant positioned the platform as providing fine-grained authorization, immutable audit logs, and protection against prompt poisoning and man-in-the-middle attacks, with optional LLM hosting or BYO keys to cloud LLM services.






## Key Information


- Jason Vallery spent 13 years at Microsoft prior to joining VAST Data and is based in Colorado (with a prior tour of duty in Seattle).

- Avinash Lakshman is based in the Bay Area, specifically Los Altos, California.

- Welliptic is named after mathematician André Weil, and the "elliptic" portion references elliptic curves used in elliptic curve cryptography in Welliptic's systems.

- Welliptic's foundational platform is described as a globally distributed, cryptographically secure compute platform coupled with a virtual sandbox environment for executing applications such as AI agents, MCP servers, and Web2 applications.

- Welliptic claims its platform provides trust, security, verifiability, and observability for applications deployed on it, including immutable audit logs that show who did what.

- Welliptic described two offerings on top of the foundational platform: Icarus (a virtual conversational agent enabling natural-language workflows to proprietary systems via APIs) and Daedalus (a trust-aware agent orchestrator).

- Welliptic positions Icarus and Daedalus as enabling fine-grained authorization controls over what an agent can do in enterprise systems, plus end-to-end visibility, observability, and auditability.

- Welliptic claims its cryptographic approach mitigates prompt poisoning and man-in-the-middle attacks by preventing interception and modification of prompts in transit.

- Welliptic is offered as a SaaS platform that runs across AWS, Azure, and GCP as one global fabric, using deployments called "pods" that contain multiple "nodes" and can be distributed across multiple cloud providers and regions for resilience.

- Welliptic's platform is positioned as taking responsibility for MCP server infrastructure, autoscaling, and security, reducing the burden on customers compared to deploying MCP infrastructure themselves for OpenAI or Anthropic integrations.

- Welliptic can integrate with enterprise systems via MCP connectors, including Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Amazon Aurora, Amazon S3, MongoDB, and Kafka.

- Welliptic can optionally host LLMs, but typically expects customers to use cloud LLM services (Google Vertex AI, Amazon Bedrock, and an Azure equivalent) with bring-your-own keys.

- Welliptic's chatbot uses an identity model where a user's identity is represented as a wallet deployed as a browser plugin, and users can store API keys (for example OpenAI keys) in the wallet so Welliptic does not see the keys.
