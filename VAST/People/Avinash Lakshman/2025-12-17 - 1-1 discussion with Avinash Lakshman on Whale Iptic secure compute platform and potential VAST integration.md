# 1:1 discussion with Avinash Lakshman on Whale Iptic secure compute platform and potential VAST integration

**Date**: 2025-12-17
**With**: Myself, Avinash Lakshman

## Summary

On 2025-12-17, Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman discussed Whale Iptic's globally distributed secure compute platform (Icarus agent and Cerebrum SDK) and how it could align with VAST Data storage plus GPU infrastructure across hyperscalers and neoclouds. Next step is for Jason to email Avinash public links and information about VAST's current and upcoming capabilities, and for Avinash to review and propose potential integration ideas.


## Action Items


- [?] Send Avinash Lakshman a follow-up email with public links and information about VAST Data's current and upcoming capabilities (suitable for external sharing). @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Review the VAST Data public information sent by Jason Vallery and propose potential integration or alignment ideas between Whale Iptic's secure compute platform and VAST Data's roadmap. @Avinash Lakshman 🔽 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Jason Vallery will send Avinash Lakshman a follow-up email with public links and information about VAST Data's current and upcoming capabilities.

- Avinash Lakshman will review the VAST Data information and consider potential integration or alignment between Whale Iptic's platform and VAST Data's roadmap, then potentially follow up with ideas or proposals.




## Key Information


- Avinash Lakshman presented Whale Iptic's platform as a globally distributed, cryptographically secure compute platform with virtual sandbox environments for AI agents and Web2 applications.

- Whale Iptic's two named offerings are Icarus (a conversational agent that can interact with enterprise-grade systems) and Cerebrum (an SDK for a trust-aware agent orchestrator with fine-grained authorization control and auditability).

- Whale Iptic demonstrated a multi-pod architecture running across AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure to reduce disruption risk from a single cloud provider outage.

- Whale Iptic described a distributed ledger system intended to provide data sovereignty and fault tolerance across cloud regions using custom Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms.

- Avinash Lakshman demonstrated a secure and auditable interaction model using digital signatures and identity-based wallets in the browser, positioning it as providing more auditability and visibility of actions than traditional TLS-only approaches.

- Jason Vallery raised a concern about whether a browser agent is necessary for the security model; Avinash Lakshman responded that the browser agent is minimal and focused on identity management.

- Jason Vallery described VAST Data's vision to move up the value stack by combining VAST's storage platform with an AI agent engine, targeting enterprises with data lakes in hyperscalers and GPUs distributed across multiple neoclouds.

- Jason Vallery stated that VAST Data provides storage solutions used for training data and model distribution for large language models, and mentioned customers including xAI, Tesla, and CoreWeave.

- Jason Vallery stated that VAST Data serves cloud and on-premises customers across sectors including hedge funds, supercomputers, and national labs, and focuses on enabling hyperscalers and neoclouds to deploy quickly on commodity infrastructure.

- Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman discussed integrating GPU infrastructure with distributed ledger technology to enable secure, verifiable, and observable AI agent execution in a global state scenario.

- Avinash Lakshman requested access to public information on VAST Data's current development status, and Jason Vallery agreed to provide it via email.

- The Zoom AI Companion meeting summary includes a claim of a '$1.2 billion deal with VAST' and mentions 'stablecoin issuance and agent e-commerce' as expansion plans; this is AI-generated and may be inaccurate.
