# Whale Iptic platform overview and potential VAST integration (Avinash Lakshman 2025-12-17)

**Date**: 2025-12-17
**Account**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Jason Vallery, Avinash Lakshman

## Summary

Avinash Lakshman presented Whale Iptic's globally distributed secure compute platform for AI agents and Web2 apps, including Icarus (conversational agent) and Cerebrum (trust-aware agent orchestrator SDK). We discussed potential integration areas with VAST storage and GPU infrastructure across hyperscalers and neoclouds, plus secure, verifiable agent execution using distributed ledger technology. Next step is for me to send Avinash public links and information on VAST current and upcoming capabilities for him to review and respond with alignment ideas.


## Action Items


- [?] Send Avinash Lakshman a follow-up email with public links and information about VAST Data's current and upcoming capabilities relevant to potential Whale Iptic integration or alignment. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Review VAST Data public materials provided by Jason Vallery and propose how Whale Iptic's platform (Icarus, Cerebrum, distributed ledger) could integrate with or align to VAST Data roadmap, then follow up with ideas or a proposal. @Avinash Lakshman #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman agreed that Jason will send Avinash Lakshman public links and information about VAST Data's current and upcoming capabilities for Whale Iptic integration evaluation.

- Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman agreed to maintain communication and continue the dialogue on potential VAST Data and Whale Iptic alignment.




## Key Information


- Avinash Lakshman presented Whale Iptic as a globally distributed compute platform with virtual sandbox environments for AI agents and Web2 applications.

- Whale Iptic's offerings include Icarus, a virtual conversational agent intended to interact with enterprise-grade systems, and Cerebrum, an SDK for a trust-aware agent orchestrator with fine-grained authorization and auditability.

- Whale Iptic described a multi-pod architecture deployed across AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure to reduce disruption risk from a single cloud provider outage.

- Whale Iptic described a distributed ledger system for data sovereignty and fault tolerance across cloud regions using custom Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms.

- Avinash Lakshman demonstrated a secure LLM management platform that hosts MCP servers and manages LLMs via cloud provider services, using digital signatures and identity-based wallets in the browser for auditable interactions.

- Jason Vallery raised a concern about whether a browser agent is necessary for Whale Iptic's security model, and Avinash Lakshman stated the browser agent is minimal and focused on identity management to enable auditability and visibility of actions.

- Jason Vallery described VAST Data's vision to move up the value stack by combining VAST storage with an AI agent engine, targeting enterprises with data lakes in hyperscalers and GPUs distributed across multiple neoclouds.

- Jason Vallery stated VAST Data provides storage used for training data and model distribution for large language models at companies including xAI, Tesla, and CoreWeave, and serves cloud and on-premises customers across sectors such as hedge funds, supercomputers, and national labs.

- Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman discussed integrating GPU infrastructure with distributed ledger technology to enable secure, verifiable, and observable AI agent execution in a global state scenario.

- Avinash Lakshman requested public information on VAST Data's current development status and capabilities to evaluate potential integration or alignment with Whale Iptic's platform.
