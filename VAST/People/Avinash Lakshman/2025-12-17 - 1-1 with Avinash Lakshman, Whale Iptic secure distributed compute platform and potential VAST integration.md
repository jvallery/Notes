# 1:1 with Avinash Lakshman, Whale Iptic secure distributed compute platform and potential VAST integration

**Date**: 2025-12-17
**With**: Myself, Avinash Lakshman

## Summary

Avinash Lakshman presented Whale Iptic's globally distributed secure compute platform (Icarus agent and Cerebrum SDK) with multi-cloud multi-pod architecture and a distributed ledger for data sovereignty and fault tolerance. Jason Vallery and Avinash discussed potential integration areas between VAST storage, GPU infrastructure across neoclouds, and verifiable agent execution using distributed ledger technology. Jason is expected to send Avinash public links and information about VAST capabilities for Avinash to review and potentially respond with integration ideas.


## Action Items


- [?] Send Avinash Lakshman a follow-up email with public links and information about VAST Data's current and upcoming capabilities, to support Whale Iptic integration/alignment evaluation. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Review the VAST Data information provided by Jason Vallery and propose potential integration or alignment ideas between Whale Iptic's platform and VAST Data capabilities. @Avinash Lakshman #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Jason Vallery will send Avinash Lakshman a follow-up email with public links and information about VAST Data's current and upcoming capabilities for Whale Iptic to review.

- Avinash Lakshman will review VAST Data information and consider potential integration or alignment with Whale Iptic's platform, then potentially follow up with ideas or proposals.




## Key Information


- Avinash Lakshman presented Whale Iptic as a globally distributed compute platform with virtual sandbox environments for AI agents and Web2 applications.

- Whale Iptic's offerings include Icarus (a conversational agent that can interact with enterprise-grade systems) and Cerebrum (an SDK for a trust-aware agent orchestrator with fine-grained authorization and auditability).

- Whale Iptic demonstrated a multi-pod architecture running across AWS, GCP, and Azure to reduce disruption risk from a single cloud provider outage.

- Whale Iptic described a distributed ledger system intended to provide data sovereignty and fault tolerance across cloud regions using custom BFT consensus algorithms.

- Avinash Lakshman demonstrated a secure and auditable interaction model using digital signatures and identity-based wallets in the browser, positioning it as providing more auditability and visibility than traditional TLS-only approaches.

- Jason Vallery described VAST Data's vision to move up the value stack by combining VAST's storage platform with an AI agent engine for enterprises with data lakes in hyperscalers and GPUs distributed across multiple neoclouds.

- Jason Vallery stated that VAST Data provides storage solutions used for training data and model distribution for large language models, and mentioned deployments across sectors including hedge funds, supercomputers, and national labs for cloud and on-premises customers.

- Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman discussed integrating GPU infrastructure with distributed ledger technology to enable secure, verifiable, and observable agent execution in a global state scenario.
