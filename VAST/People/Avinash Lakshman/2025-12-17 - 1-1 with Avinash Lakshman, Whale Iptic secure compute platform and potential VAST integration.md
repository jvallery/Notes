# 1:1 with Avinash Lakshman, Whale Iptic secure compute platform and potential VAST integration

**Date**: 2025-12-17
**With**: Jason Vallery, Avinash Lakshman

## Summary

Avinash Lakshman presented Whale Iptic's globally distributed secure compute platform for AI agents and Web2 apps, including Icarus (conversational agent) and Cerebrum (trust-aware agent orchestrator SDK). Jason Vallery and Avinash discussed potential integration areas between VAST Data storage, multi-cloud GPU infrastructure, and distributed ledger technology for secure, verifiable agent execution, with Jason to follow up by email with public VAST capability links.


## Action Items


- [?] Send Avinash Lakshman a follow-up email with public links and information about VAST Data's current and upcoming capabilities relevant to Whale Iptic integration/alignment. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Verify the accuracy and context of the Zoom AI summary claim about a "recent $1.2 billion deal" involving VAST Data before referencing it in any external communication. @Myself #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Jason Vallery will send Avinash Lakshman a follow-up email with public links and information about VAST Data's current and upcoming capabilities.

- Avinash Lakshman will review the VAST Data information and consider integration or alignment with Whale Iptic's platform, then potentially follow up with ideas or proposals.




## Key Information


- Avinash Lakshman presented Whale Iptic's platform as a globally distributed compute platform with virtual sandbox environments for AI agents and Web2 applications.

- Whale Iptic's platform includes Icarus, a conversational agent intended to interact with enterprise-grade systems.

- Whale Iptic's platform includes Cerebrum, an SDK for a trust-aware agent orchestrator with fine-grained authorization control and auditability.

- Whale Iptic described a multi-pod architecture running across AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure to reduce disruption risk from a single cloud provider outage.

- Avinash Lakshman described a distributed ledger system intended to provide data sovereignty and fault tolerance across cloud regions using custom Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms.

- Avinash Lakshman demonstrated a secure and auditable interaction model using digital signatures and identity-based wallets in the browser, positioned as providing more auditability than traditional TLS-only security.

- Jason Vallery described VAST Data's strategy to move up the value stack by combining VAST's storage platform with an AI agent engine for enterprises with data lakes in hyperscalers and GPUs distributed across multiple neoclouds.

- Jason Vallery stated VAST Data provides storage used by xAI, Tesla, and CoreWeave for training data and model distribution for large language models.

- Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman discussed an opportunity for VAST Data to provide a complete "neocloud in a box" solution for newer cloud providers with varying maturity levels.

- Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman discussed integrating GPU infrastructure with distributed ledger technology to enable secure, verifiable, and observable AI agent execution in a global state scenario.

- The Zoom AI summary claims Jason Vallery referenced a recent $1.2 billion deal involving VAST Data to deliver infrastructure, but the counterparty and details were not specified in the email and should be verified before reuse.
