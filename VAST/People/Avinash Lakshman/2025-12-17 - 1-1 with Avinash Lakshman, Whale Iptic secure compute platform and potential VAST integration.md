# 1:1 with Avinash Lakshman, Whale Iptic secure compute platform and potential VAST integration

**Date**: 2025-12-17
**With**: Jason Vallery, Avinash Lakshman

## Summary

Avinash Lakshman presented Whale Iptic's globally distributed secure compute platform for AI agents and Web2 apps, including Icarus (conversational agent) and Cerebrum (trust-aware agent orchestrator SDK). Jason Vallery and Avinash discussed potential alignment with VAST Data storage, GPU infrastructure across neoclouds, and distributed ledger technology for secure, verifiable agent execution, with Jason to send public VAST capability links as follow-up.


## Action Items


- [?] Send Avinash Lakshman a follow-up email with public links and information about VAST Data's current and upcoming capabilities (suitable for external sharing) to support evaluation of integration/alignment with Whale Iptic. @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Review the VAST Data public information sent by Jason Vallery and consider how Whale Iptic could integrate or align with VAST Data's roadmap, then follow up with ideas or a proposal. @Avinash Lakshman #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Jason Vallery will send Avinash Lakshman a follow-up email with public links and information about VAST Data's current and upcoming capabilities so Avinash can evaluate potential integration or alignment.




## Key Information


- Avinash Lakshman presented Whale Iptic's platform as a globally distributed, cryptographically secure compute platform with virtual sandbox environments for AI agents and Web2 applications.

- Avinash Lakshman described Whale Iptic's two main offerings as Icarus (a virtual conversational agent that can interact with enterprise-grade systems) and Cerebrum (an SDK for a trust-aware agent orchestrator with fine-grained authorization control and auditability).

- Avinash Lakshman stated Whale Iptic uses a multi-pod architecture across AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure to reduce the risk of service disruption from a single cloud provider outage.

- Avinash Lakshman described a distributed ledger system intended to provide data sovereignty and fault tolerance across cloud regions using custom Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms.

- Jason Vallery described VAST Data's vision to move up the value stack by combining VAST's storage platform with an AI agent engine, targeting enterprises with data lakes in hyperscalers and GPUs spread across multiple neoclouds.

- Jason Vallery stated VAST Data provides storage solutions used for training data and model distribution for large language models, and mentioned customers including xAI, Tesla, and CoreWeave (as stated in the AI-generated meeting summary).

- Jason Vallery raised a concern about whether Whale Iptic's security model requires a browser agent, and Avinash Lakshman responded that the browser agent is minimal and focused on identity management while enabling auditability and visibility of actions.

- Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman discussed integrating GPU infrastructure with distributed ledger technology to enable secure, verifiable, and observable agent execution in a global state scenario.
