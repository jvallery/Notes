# Zoom meeting summary: Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman, Whale Iptic secure compute platform and potential VAST integration

**Date**: 2025-12-17
**With**: Myself, Avinash Lakshman

## Summary

On 2025-12-17, Avinash Lakshman presented Whale Iptic's globally distributed secure compute platform (Icarus agent and Cerebrum SDK) and a distributed-ledger-based approach to data sovereignty and fault tolerance. Jason Vallery and Avinash discussed how VAST Data storage and GPU infrastructure could integrate with Whale Iptic's distributed ledger and agent execution model, and agreed Jason would send public VAST capability links for Avinash to review and respond with integration ideas.


## Action Items


- [?] Send Avinash Lakshman a follow-up email with public links and information about VAST Data's current and upcoming capabilities so Whale Iptic can evaluate potential integration/alignment. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Review the VAST Data public capability information from Jason Vallery and propose ideas or a concrete integration/alignment approach between Whale Iptic's platform and VAST Data's roadmap. @Avinash Lakshman #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Jason Vallery will send Avinash Lakshman a follow-up email with public links and information about VAST Data's current and upcoming capabilities for Whale Iptic to evaluate potential alignment or integration.




## Key Information


- Avinash Lakshman presented Whale Iptic's platform as a globally distributed, cryptographically secure compute platform with virtual sandbox environments for AI agents and Web2 applications.

- Whale Iptic's two named offerings discussed were Icarus (a conversational agent that can interact with enterprise-grade systems) and Cerebrum (an SDK for a trust-aware agent orchestrator with fine-grained authorization control and auditability).

- Avinash Lakshman described Whale Iptic's multi-pod architecture running across AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure to reduce disruption risk from a single cloud provider outage.

- Avinash Lakshman demonstrated a secure and auditable interaction model using digital signatures and identity-based wallets in the browser, positioning it as providing stronger auditability and visibility than traditional TLS-only approaches.

- Jason Vallery raised a concern about whether a browser agent is necessary for security; Avinash Lakshman responded that the browser agent is minimal and primarily for identity management.

- Avinash Lakshman described a distributed ledger system intended to provide data sovereignty and fault tolerance across cloud regions using custom Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms.

- Jason Vallery described VAST Data's vision to move up the value stack by combining VAST storage with an AI agent engine, targeting enterprises with data lakes in hyperscalers and GPUs distributed across multiple neocloud providers.

- Jason Vallery stated that VAST Data provides storage solutions used for training data and model distribution for large language models, and mentioned deployments with xAI, Tesla, and CoreWeave (as examples cited in the meeting summary).

- Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman discussed an opportunity for VAST Data to provide a complete 'neocloud in a box' solution to help newer cloud providers deploy quickly on commodity infrastructure.

- Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman discussed integrating GPU infrastructure with distributed ledger technology to enable secure, verifiable, and observable AI agent execution in a global state scenario.

- Avinash Lakshman requested access to public information on VAST Data's current development status and capabilities; Jason Vallery agreed to provide this via follow-up email.
