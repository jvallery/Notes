# 1:1 with Rosanne Kincaid–Smith: Dhammak GPU cloud buildout and Microsoft partnership positioning

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**With**: Jason Vallery, Rosanne Kincaid–Smith

## Summary

Rosanne Kincaid–Smith described Dhammak’s rapid data center expansion and plan to build a vertically integrated GPU cloud, with a goal of landing a marquee Microsoft tenant relationship similar to CoreWeave/Nscale. Jason Vallery shared guidance on Microsoft’s preference for in-house builds, how Microsoft uses neoclouds to shift capex and asset risk, and how workload placement constraints (training vs inference, fiber to hyperscaler hero regions) affect site viability and cluster design.

## Action Items

- [?] Define Microsoft partnership positioning that emphasizes Dhammak absorbing GPU capex and asset risk while offering flexible, fungible clusters suitable for Microsoft consumption models. @Rosanne Kincaid–Smith 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Assess fiber and backhaul plans from candidate Dhammak sites to hyperscaler hero regions to determine whether sites can support training-grade throughput versus inference-only workloads. @Rosanne Kincaid–Smith 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Model expected workload mix per Dhammak site (training vs inference, single-tenant vs multi-tenant) to guide cluster design and customer targeting for the GPU cloud. @Rosanne Kincaid–Smith 📅 2025-10-26 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Prepare an internal Dhammak brief addressing board concerns by distinguishing plain co-location risk from neocloud risk-transfer models used by Microsoft partnerships. @Rosanne Kincaid–Smith 📅 2025-10-26 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Proceed with Microsoft discussions via Anand (Microsoft contact) and update Jason Vallery on outcomes and timing assumptions for a potential Dhammak-Microsoft partnership. @Rosanne Kincaid–Smith 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Share Dhammak site connectivity and timeline assumptions with Jason Vallery to validate workload feasibility (training vs inference) for early capacity coming online. @Rosanne Kincaid–Smith 📅 2025-10-26 #task #proposed #auto

## Key Information

- Rosanne Kincaid–Smith is based in Dubai and was traveling from the San Francisco Bay Area during the 2025-10-22 meeting.

- Rosanne Kincaid–Smith previously ran a cloud business called Tiger and worked with VAST Data during that time; she left Tiger about a year before joining Dimac/Dhammak.

- Dhammak (also referred to as Dimac in the transcript) diversified into data centers about four years prior to 2025-10-22 and has acquired nearly 5 GW of land and power for data center construction.

- Dhammak plans to bring approximately 500 MW of data center capacity to market by early 2026 and then scale in gigawatt increments across Asia, the United States, and Europe.

- Dhammak is building a vertically integrated cloud platform focused on AI workloads using GPUs, not just GPU hosting.

- Dhammak is seeking a marquee tenant relationship with Microsoft similar to Microsoft’s partnerships with CoreWeave and Nscale, to anchor early GPU cluster utilization.

- Lior Genzel is facilitating a Microsoft conversation for Dhammak with a Microsoft contact named Anand (last name not provided).

- Jason Vallery joined VAST Data in the week of 2025-10-22 and previously led the Microsoft Storage Platform product, supporting Microsoft AI initiatives and the storage relationship with OpenAI.

- Jason Vallery stated Microsoft prefers to keep AI infrastructure capacity builds in-house, but uses neocloud partners as a hedge to mitigate risk and accelerate capacity when hyperscaler construction schedules lag demand.
