# 1:1 with Rosanne Kincaid–Smith, Microsoft GPU capacity posture and Dhammak anchor-tenant strategy (2025-10-22)

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**With**: Jason Vallery, Rosanne Kincaid–Smith, Lior Genzel

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Rosanne Kincaid–Smith discussed Microsoft’s GPU capacity strategy, including a preference for in-house builds with selective neo-cloud partnerships to hedge capacity gaps and shift GPU capex risk. Rosanne shared Dhammak Group’s rapid data center and GPU cloud buildout plan and the need to secure Microsoft as a marquee anchor tenant, with site fiber proximity called out as a key determinant for training workload viability.

## Action Items

- [?] Proceed with Microsoft engagement by holding the conversation with Anand at Microsoft that is being facilitated by Lior Genzel, focused on marquee tenant options for Dhammak GPU clusters. @Rosanne Kincaid–Smith 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Evaluate Dhammak data center site selection against fiber routes to hyperscaler hero regions to determine which sites can support training workloads versus inference-only deployments. @Rosanne Kincaid–Smith 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Refine Dhammak’s financial model to absorb GPU asset risk and ensure cluster fungibility and repurposing across training and inference tenants as accelerator generations change. @Rosanne Kincaid–Smith 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Proceed with Microsoft engagement via the conversation with Anand at Microsoft facilitated by Lior Genzel, focused on marquee tenant options for Dhammak GPU clusters. @Rosanne Kincaid–Smith 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Evaluate Dhammak data center site selection against fiber routes and proximity to hyperscaler hero regions to determine feasibility for training workloads versus inference-only placement. @Rosanne Kincaid–Smith 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Refine Dhammak financial model to absorb GPU asset risk and ensure cluster fungibility and repurposing across training and inference tenants as demand shifts. @Rosanne Kincaid–Smith 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

## Key Information

- Rosanne Kincaid–Smith is based in Dubai and was traveling in the San Francisco Bay Area during the 2025-10-22 meeting, flying out that evening.

- Rosanne Kincaid–Smith recently joined Dhammak Group to build a vertically integrated GPU and cloud platform, after previously running a cloud business called Tiger and spending most of her career in private equity and technology portfolios.

- Dhammak Group is primarily a luxury residential real estate and community infrastructure company in Dubai that diversified into data centers about four years prior to 2025-10-22.

- Dhammak Group acquired nearly 5 gigawatts of power and land for data center expansion and is targeting approximately 500 megawatts of capacity online by early 2026, with multi-gigawatt expansion planned across Asia, the United States, and Europe.

- Dhammak’s GPU cloud strategy depends on securing a marquee anchor tenant for clusters, modeled after Microsoft’s partnerships with neo-cloud providers such as CoreWeave and Nscale.

- Lior Genzel is facilitating a conversation between Rosanne Kincaid–Smith and an individual named Anand at Microsoft regarding potential Microsoft engagement as a marquee tenant.

- Jason Vallery joined VAST Data in the week of 2025-10-22 (day three at VAST) to lead product management focused on hybrid scalers and frontier model builders.

- Jason Vallery previously served as product lead for the Microsoft Storage Platform, supporting Microsoft AI initiatives and the storage relationship with OpenAI, and worked closely with OpenAI.

- Jason Vallery’s view of Microsoft’s GPU capacity strategy is that Microsoft prefers to keep as much GPU capacity in-house as possible, using neo-cloud partnerships selectively to hedge capacity gaps and shift GPU capex risk.

- Microsoft’s traditional data center planning and build cycle is approximately five years from project greenlight to first power, which contributed to hyperscalers being caught flat-footed by the sudden surge in GPU demand.

- Lease pullbacks in the GPU capacity market were described as finance-driven balance sheet risk management, with some leases later resuming as demand materialized.

- GPU asset life and depreciation are often modeled at five years, but the useful life is uncertain due to rapid accelerator roadmap changes (example cited: H100 to GB200).

- Workload placement tradeoffs depend on network and fiber proximity: power-rich sites without major fiber are better suited for inference than training, while training benefits from strong interconnect to hyperscaler hero regions.

- The meeting asserted that data gravity is shifting as compute chases power, increasing the importance of moving data to distributed compute locations.

- VAST Data’s global data namespace was positioned as a way to connect data to distributed compute across sites and clouds.

- Jason Vallery was on day 3 at VAST Data and is leading product management focused on hybrid scalers and frontier model builders.

- Jason Vallery previously led product for the Microsoft Storage Platform and supported Microsoft AI initiatives, including the storage relationship with OpenAI.

- Rosanne Kincaid–Smith is based in Dubai and recently joined Dhammak Group to build a vertically integrated GPU and cloud platform.

- Rosanne Kincaid–Smith’s background is predominantly private equity and technology portfolio work; she previously ran a cloud business called Tiger.

- Dhammak Group is a Dubai-based luxury residential real estate and community infrastructure company that diversified into data centers about four years prior to 2025-10-22.

- Dhammak Group acquired nearly 5 GW of power and land for data center development and planned to bring approximately 500 MW of capacity online by early 2026, with multi-gigawatt expansion across Asia, the US, and Europe.

- Dhammak’s GPU cloud strategy includes securing a marquee anchor tenant similar to Microsoft’s partnerships with CoreWeave and other neo-clouds.

- Lior Genzel was facilitating a conversation between Rosanne Kincaid–Smith and an Anand at Microsoft regarding potential Microsoft engagement as a marquee tenant.

- Microsoft’s GPU capacity posture (as described by Jason Vallery) is to prefer in-house data center builds while using selective neo-cloud partnerships as risk mitigation to cover capacity gaps and shift GPU capex risk.

- Microsoft’s traditional data center planning and build cycle is approximately five years from project greenlight to first power online, which contributed to being caught flat-footed by the sudden surge in GPU demand.
