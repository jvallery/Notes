# 1:1 with Rosanne Kincaid–Smith, Microsoft GPU capacity posture and Dhammak anchor-tenant strategy

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**With**: Jason Vallery, Rosanne Kincaid–Smith, Lior Genzel, Anand (Unknown)

## Summary

Jason Vallery shared candid guidance on Microsoft’s GPU capacity strategy, including a preference for in-house builds with selective neo-cloud partnerships to hedge capacity gaps and shift GPU capex risk. Rosanne Kincaid–Smith described Dhammak Group’s rapid data center and vertically integrated GPU cloud buildout and their goal of securing Microsoft as a marquee anchor tenant; no decisions or dates were set.


## Action Items


- [?] Proceed with Microsoft engagement via the conversation with Anand at Microsoft facilitated by Lior Genzel, focused on marquee tenant options for Dhammak GPU clusters. @Rosanne Kincaid–Smith 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Evaluate Dhammak data center site selection against fiber routes and proximity to hyperscaler hero regions to determine feasibility for training workloads versus inference-only placement. @Rosanne Kincaid–Smith 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Refine Dhammak financial model to absorb GPU asset risk and ensure cluster fungibility and repurposing across training and inference tenants as demand shifts. @Rosanne Kincaid–Smith 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Jason Vallery was on day 3 at VAST Data and is leading product management focused on hybrid scalers and frontier model builders.

- Jason Vallery previously led product for the Microsoft Storage Platform and supported Microsoft AI initiatives, including the storage relationship with OpenAI.

- Rosanne Kincaid–Smith is based in Dubai and recently joined Dhammak Group to build a vertically integrated GPU and cloud platform.

- Rosanne Kincaid–Smith’s background is predominantly private equity and technology portfolio work; she previously ran a cloud business called Tiger.

- Dhammak Group is a Dubai-based luxury residential real estate and community infrastructure company that diversified into data centers about four years prior to 2025-10-22.

- Dhammak Group acquired nearly 5 GW of power and land for data center development and planned to bring approximately 500 MW of capacity online by early 2026, with multi-gigawatt expansion across Asia, the US, and Europe.

- Dhammak’s GPU cloud strategy includes securing a marquee anchor tenant similar to Microsoft’s partnerships with CoreWeave and other neo-clouds.

- Lior Genzel was facilitating a conversation between Rosanne Kincaid–Smith and an Anand at Microsoft regarding potential Microsoft engagement as a marquee tenant.

- Microsoft’s GPU capacity posture (as described by Jason Vallery) is to prefer in-house data center builds while using selective neo-cloud partnerships as risk mitigation to cover capacity gaps and shift GPU capex risk.

- Microsoft’s traditional data center planning and build cycle is approximately five years from project greenlight to first power online, which contributed to being caught flat-footed by the sudden surge in GPU demand.
