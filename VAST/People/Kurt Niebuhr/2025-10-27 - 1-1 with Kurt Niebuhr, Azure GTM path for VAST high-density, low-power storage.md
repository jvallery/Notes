# 1:1 with Kurt Niebuhr, Azure GTM path for VAST high-density, low-power storage

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**With**: Jason Vallery, Kurt Niebuhr

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Kurt Niebuhr aligned on a go-to-market path to bring VAST Data's high-density, lower-power storage into Microsoft Azure deals, prioritizing a BizDev-led route to executive sponsorship and Ronnie Booker's hardware decision org. Kurt described his remit in Azure AI Infrastructure pre-sales and his proposal to GA Azure Extended Zones (network-only) plus AKS NodeJoin to connect sovereign and neo-cloud training sites to Azure for global inference, while Jason highlighted VAST's density and power advantages and the limitations of the current Azure Marketplace VM-based offer.


## Action Items


- [?] Educate Microsoft BizDev on VAST Data density and power advantages and the single-namespace story, and secure introductions to Ronnie Booker's organization via John Tinter. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Create a one-pager converting VAST Data exabyte-level power savings into additional GPUs per site, and share it with Mustafa (MAI), Kushal, and Vipin at Microsoft. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Push Microsoft MAI and the UK Met deployment teams to pilot VAST Data OEM/ODM racks for Falcon and UK Met using the power-density angle. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Follow up with Kanchan Mehrotra on storage plays and density messaging for Supercomputing (FAST) and schedule a discussion. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Kishore Enamapuri on Azure Extended Zones once A2N is approved, and align on VAST Data storage needs for the Extended Zones and NodeJoin approach. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Drive A2N approval for Azure Extended Zones GA and AKS NodeJoin (ACAS FlexNode), and confirm timeline and scope for the GA motion. @Kurt Niebuhr 📅 2025-10-27 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Share the Azure Extended Zones product manager contact details with Jason Vallery when available. @Kurt Niebuhr 📅 2025-10-27 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Keep Jason Vallery updated on the neo-cloud partnership pipeline, including sovereign and neo-cloud partners such as sakura.net, and identify where VAST Data can plug into the motion. @Kurt Niebuhr 📅 2025-10-27 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm with Yancey (last name not provided) and Lior Genzel that they understand VAST Data density and power benefits, and enlist them to advocate with Mustafa (MAI) internally at Microsoft. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Assess complementing the VAST Data Azure Marketplace L-series offer with higher-density storage SKUs or an OEM hardware path to improve density and cost-per-PB competitiveness. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Quantify capex versus power tradeoffs to justify approximately 2x capex for VAST Data versus Azure Blob storage to decision-makers such as Amy Hood and Microsoft BizDev stakeholders. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Validate whether InScale and similar deals follow the model of training on a neo-cloud and running inference on Azure, to inform targeting for the Extended Zones and NodeJoin motion. @Kurt Niebuhr 📅 2025-10-27 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Plan a Supercomputing conference touchpoint and introductions (including an AMD event) with Kurt Niebuhr, and align on joint targets for Azure AI infrastructure and neo-cloud partnerships. @Myself 📅 2025-10-27 🔽 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Pursue a Microsoft BizDev-led engagement path (via Joe Vane and Harish) to secure executive sponsorship from John Tinter and route into Ronnie Booker's organization for hardware design decisions, rather than pursuing an engagement path through Nidhi or Manish.

- Treat the current VAST Data Azure Marketplace VM-based offer on Azure L-series VMs as a procurement checkbox, while pushing a hardware or OEM/ODM storage-dense path to achieve meaningful density and power wins in Azure AI infrastructure deployments.




## Key Information


- Kurt Niebuhr is the global pre-sales lead for AI Infrastructure under Zia at Microsoft; his team scores constrained GPU allocations, supports mega-deal pre-sales, and runs Azure Core feedback loops.

- At Microsoft Azure, all constrained GPU allocations require approval from Kurt Niebuhr's team, using deal triage scoring that includes stickiness, workload type, and platform pull-through.

- Kurt Niebuhr proposed generally available Azure Extended Zones (network-only) and AKS Stretch or NodeJoin (also referred to as ACAS FlexNode) to link sovereign or neo-cloud training sites to Azure for global inference.

- Jason Vallery stated that for 1 exabyte, VAST Data can deliver approximately 1/10 the racks, about 1/5 the megawatts, and at least 5x performance versus Azure Blob storage, but at roughly 2x capex.

- Jason Vallery and Kurt Niebuhr assessed that the current VAST Data Azure Marketplace offer based on Azure L-series VMs functions as a procurement checkbox and is not competitive on density or performance for real workloads.

- For the Microsoft Apollo program, Chi owns the bare-metal control plane, Sky and Overlake own security, and Ronnie Booker's organization owns chassis, layout, and storage placement decisions.

- Kurt Niebuhr identified a BizDev path for Azure engagement: Joe Vane (who reports to Harish) to secure executive sponsorship from John Tinter and then route to Ronnie Booker's organization for hardware design decisions.

- Kurt Niebuhr noted that Microsoft Azure currently lacks topology-aware scheduling for MAI or Falcon; InfiniBand and telemetry are improving, but rack-level placement is not expected until approximately February 2026.

- Kurt Niebuhr said Uday (formerly at xAI) now runs infrastructure at OpenAI, which may reduce Microsoft alignment; he emphasized that power is a major constraint for Azure AI infrastructure expansion.

- Kurt Niebuhr expected A2N approval for Azure Extended Zones and AKS NodeJoin in approximately three weeks from 2025-10-27, with target partners including sovereign and neo-cloud providers such as sakura.net in Japan.

- Kurt Niebuhr described internal Microsoft org dynamics where teams are being shifted into 'buildout' work focused on capacity tracking and schedules, which he characterized as spreadsheet-driven execution rather than product or customer-facing work.
