# Kurt Niebuhr 1:1 - neo-cloud partnership pipeline updates and Supercomputing touchpoints

**Date**: 2026-01-05
**With**: Jason Vallery, Kurt Niebuhr

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Kurt Niebuhr aligned on two follow-ups: Kurt would keep Jason updated on the neo-cloud partnership pipeline (example: sakura.net) and where VAST Data can plug in, and Jason would plan Supercomputing touchpoints and introductions (example: an AMD event) to align on joint targets. Both action items were marked complete on 2025-11-08.

## Action Items

- [?] Keep Jason Vallery updated on the neo-cloud partnership pipeline (example: sakura.net) and identify where VAST Data can plug in. @Kurt Niebuhr 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Plan Supercomputing touchpoint and introductions (example: AMD event) and align joint targets. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Plan Supercomputing touchpoint and introductions (including an AMD event) and align joint targets with Kurt Niebuhr. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

## Decisions

- Use Kurt Niebuhr as the ongoing update channel for the neo-cloud partnership pipeline (including sakura.net) and identify specific integration points where VAST Data can plug in.

- Pursue Supercomputing-related touchpoints and introductions (including an AMD event) and align on joint targets between VAST Data and Microsoft stakeholders.

## Key Information

- Kurt Niebuhr is involved in managing or tracking a neo-cloud partnership pipeline and identifying where VAST Data can plug into those partnerships (example partner mentioned: sakura.net).

- Jason Vallery is responsible for planning Supercomputing conference touchpoints and introductions (example: an AMD event) to align joint targets with partners.
