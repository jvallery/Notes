## Key Facts

- Kurt Niebuhr is the global pre-sales lead for AI Infrastructure under Zia at Microsoft; his team scores constrained GPU allocations, supports mega-deal pre-sales, and runs Azure Core feedback loops.

- At Microsoft, all constrained GPU allocations require approval from Kurt Niebuhr’s AI Infrastructure pre-sales team, using deal triage scoring that includes stickiness, workload type, and platform pull-through.

- Kurt Niebuhr expected A2N approval for Azure Extended Zones and AKS NodeJoin in approximately three weeks (relative to 2025-10-27), and target partners include sovereign and neo-clouds such as sakura.net in Japan.

- Kurt Niebuhr described internal Microsoft org dynamics: many teams have been shifted to 'buildout' work focused on capacity tracking and schedules, reducing time spent on product and customer-facing skill building.

- Kurt Niebuhr was a targeted SC25 meeting/outreach item and was marked complete on 2025-11-08.

- Kurt Niebuhr is involved in a neo-cloud partnership pipeline (example partner: sakura.net) and is positioned to keep Jason Vallery updated on where VAST Data can integrate or add value.

- Kurt Niebuhr was included as a recipient for the VAST slides and access following the Microsoft GBB AKS AI Roadshow session.

- Kurt Niebuhr (Microsoft) was included as a recipient on the follow-up thread for the Microsoft GBB AKS AI Roadshow and the request for slides/code and Global Namespace on Azure demo planning.

## Topics

- Go-to-market path to bring VAST Data high-density, low-power storage into Microsoft Azure AI infrastructure deals

- Microsoft BizDev engagement strategy and executive sponsorship path (Joe Vane, Harish, John Tinter, Ronnie Booker)

- Azure Extended Zones (network-only) and AKS NodeJoin/Stretch (ACAS FlexNode) to connect sovereign and neo-cloud training sites to Azure inference

- VAST Data density, power, and performance advantages versus Azure Blob and the capex tradeoff

- Limitations of the current VAST Azure Marketplace offer on Azure L-series VMs

- Neo-cloud partnership pipeline tracking and VAST Data integration points (example: sakura.net)

- Supercomputing conference touchpoints and introductions (including AMD event)

- Joint target account and partner alignment between VAST Data and Microsoft
## Key Decisions

- Use a Microsoft BizDev-led engagement path (Joe Vane and Harish) to secure executive sponsorship (John Tinter) and route into Ronnie Booker’s organization for hardware design decisions, rather than pursuing an engagement path via Nidhi or Manish.

- Treat the current Azure Marketplace VM-based VAST offer as a procurement checkbox while pushing a hardware/OEM storage-dense path to achieve meaningful density and power wins in Azure AI infrastructure deployments.

- Use Kurt Niebuhr as the ongoing update channel for the neo-cloud partnership pipeline (including sakura.net) and identify specific integration points where VAST Data can plug in.

- Pursue Supercomputing-related touchpoints and introductions (including an AMD event) and align on joint targets between VAST Data and Microsoft stakeholders.
