# 1:1 with Jai Menon: decision path between VAST offer vs Crusoe, Microsoft Apollo scope and comp constraints

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jai Menon

## Summary

Jason Vallery told Jai Menon he is evaluating a complex, high-variance VAST Data offer against an expiring Crusoe offer, and that staying at Microsoft is not viable due to unclear Apollo scope and limited compensation levers. Jai Menon agreed it is not worth pushing Manish Sah for a modest compensation adjustment that would likely feel insulting relative to external offers. Jason Vallery will complete diligence with VAST Data leadership, quantify downside risk, decide between VAST Data and Crusoe, and then update Jai Menon.

## Action Items

- [?] Complete final diligence on the VAST Data offer by quantifying downside risk and clarifying the real expected value of the high-variance compensation structure. @Myself 📅 2025-10-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Decide between the VAST Data offer and the Crusoe offer, with the Crusoe offer deadline around Wednesday (relative to 2025-10-06) driving the decision timeline. @Myself 📅 2025-10-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Update Jai Menon with the final decision and timing, including a resignation plan if leaving Microsoft. @Myself 📅 2025-10-09 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Complete diligence on the VAST Data offer, quantify downside risk and expected value, and decide between VAST Data and Crusoe based on scope clarity and financial risk. @Myself 📅 2025-10-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Update Jai Menon with the final decision between VAST Data and Crusoe, including timing and next steps (for example, resignation plan if leaving Microsoft). @Myself 📅 2025-10-09 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] If still considering staying at Microsoft, request a written, concrete definition of Apollo scope (in-scope, out-of-scope, owners, and milestones) from Manish Sah to assess whether the role sets Jason Vallery up for success. @Myself 📅 2025-10-08 #task #proposed #auto

## Decisions

- Jai Menon will not push Maneesh Sah to pursue a Microsoft compensation adjustment for Jason Vallery because any feasible adjustment would likely be modest and perceived as insulting relative to external offers.

- Jason Vallery will proceed to choose between the VAST Data offer and the Crusoe offer, with the Crusoe deadline driving near-term timing.

- Jai Menon decided not to push Manish Sah to pursue a Microsoft compensation adjustment for Jason Vallery because any feasible adjustment would likely be modest and perceived as insulting relative to external offers.

- Jason Vallery will proceed to choose between the VAST Data offer and the Crusoe offer rather than plan on staying at Microsoft under the current Apollo scope and compensation constraints.

## Key Information

- Jason Vallery received a complex VAST Data offer with multiple compensation components that are difficult to value, creating high variance in expected outcomes.

- Jason Vallery has an expiring offer from Crusoe with a deadline around Wednesday (relative to the 2025-10-06 meeting date).

- VAST Data did not provide Jason Vallery a formal deadline for accepting the offer at the time of the 2025-10-06 conversation.

- Jai Menon indicated that any compensation adjustment Maneesh Sah could make for Jason Vallery at Microsoft would likely be modest and could be perceived as insulting compared to external offers.

- Jason Vallery estimated that leaving Microsoft would forfeit approximately $800K of vested value, which narrows the perceived gap between Microsoft and external offers.

- Jason Vallery stated that unclear scope and ownership for the Microsoft Apollo initiative is a primary blocker to staying at Microsoft, with compensation being secondary to having clear deliverables and a path to Partner.

- Jai Menon and Maneesh Sah discussed role scope for Jason Vallery, including a question of whether Jason would manage a development team versus a product management team, and noted limited experience with Jason managing a development team.

---

- Jason Vallery is evaluating an offer from VAST Data that has multiple compensation components and is difficult to value, creating uncertainty about whether it is financially better than the Crusoe offer or staying at Microsoft.

- Jason Vallery said the Crusoe offer has a deadline around Wednesday, while VAST Data did not provide a deadline at the time of the conversation.

- Jai Menon said Manish Sah believes any Microsoft compensation adjustment would be modest and could be perceived as insulting compared to the external offer level, so Manish Sah is hesitant to do the work to pursue it.

- Jason Vallery estimated he would forfeit roughly $800K of vested value by leaving Microsoft, which narrows the perceived gap between staying and external offers.

- Jai Menon stated that Microsoft Apollo scope is still in flux, and there is internal discussion about whether Jason Vallery would manage a development team versus a product management team, with limited experience observed of Jason managing a dev team.

- Jason Vallery said his primary decision driver is clear scope, ownership, and a path to Partner, and he does not see a clear scope at Microsoft that sets him up for success or supports an upward trajectory to Partner.

- Jai Menon concluded it is not worth pushing Manish Sah to pursue a compensation package for Jason Vallery if it will likely be viewed as insulting and not change the decision.
