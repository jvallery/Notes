# 1:1 with Jai Menon: decision between VAST vs Crusoe; Microsoft Apollo scope and comp not viable

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jai Menon, Maneesh Sah

## Summary

Jason Vallery discussed competing offers from VAST Data and Crusoe and concluded staying at Microsoft is not viable due to unclear Apollo scope and inability to assemble competitive compensation. Jai Menon confirmed Microsoft compensation flexibility is limited and Apollo scope remains in flux. Jason planned to meet VAST CEO Renan on 2025-10-07 to de-risk the offer and decide by the Crusoe deadline on 2025-10-08, then update Jai.

## Decisions

- Do not pursue an internal Microsoft compensation change package at this time due to constraints and risk of an uncompetitive outcome.

- Jason Vallery will not stay at Microsoft given unclear Apollo scope and lack of a defined path to Partner.

- Jason Vallery will choose between the VAST Data offer and the Crusoe offer by 2025-10-08 and will update Jai Menon.

- Do not pursue an internal Microsoft compensation change or revised scope package for Jason Vallery at this time due to constraints and risk of an uncompetitive outcome.

- Jason Vallery will choose between the VAST Data offer and the Crusoe offer by Wednesday 2025-10-08 and will update Jai Menon after deciding.

## Key Information

- Crusoe offer decision deadline for Jason Vallery was Wednesday, 2025-10-08; VAST Data did not provide a deadline at the time of the call.

- Jason Vallery had an offer from VAST Data with multiple compensation components that were difficult to value, including sales-linked commission-like upside.

- Jai Menon indicated Microsoft could likely not assemble a compensation package competitive with Jason Vallery's external offers, and that even a materially higher number would take significant effort and still risk appearing insulting relative to a ~$2M external offer.

- Apollo scope at Microsoft was described as still in flux, with uncertainty about role expectations (managing a development team vs managing a PM team).

- Jason Vallery stated he would forfeit approximately $800K of vested compensation if he left Microsoft, reducing the incremental gap versus a ~$2M external offer to roughly $1.1M-$1.2M.

- Jason Vallery emphasized that clear scope, ownership of deliverables, and a defined path to Partner at Microsoft were more important than incremental compensation, and he did not see a concrete path at the time of the call.

- Jason Vallery reported that when he approached Manish (likely Maneesh Sah) in early May 2025 about switching teams, Manish said he would talk to Girish about a Partner path, but Jason did not receive a concrete outcome.

- Crusoe offer decision deadline for Jason Vallery is Wednesday 2025-10-08; VAST Data did not provide a deadline at the time of the meeting.

- Jason Vallery has an offer from VAST Data with multiple compensation components that are difficult to value, including sales-linked commission tied to OpenAI and Azure outcomes and a modest equity component; potential payout ranges from zero to many millions depending on sales performance.

- Jason Vallery stated he would forfeit approximately $800K of vested Microsoft compensation if he leaves, reducing the net incremental gap versus a $2M offer to roughly $1.1M to $1.2M.

- Jai Menon indicated Microsoft cannot assemble a compelling compensation package for Jason Vallery relative to external offers; a number around $200K would be perceived as insulting given the external $2M context.

- Apollo scope at Microsoft remains in flux with unclear boundaries and multiple stakeholders; this uncertainty is a major blocker for Jason Vallery because he wants clear ownership, deliverables, and a defined path to Partner.

- Jai Menon raised that Microsoft has seen Jason Vallery succeed managing product management work, but has limited experience with him managing a development team, which factors into role-scope discussions.

- Jason Vallery previously asked Maneesh Sah to move into Jai Menon's team and requested a clear path to Partner; Maneesh Sah said he would talk to Girish about Partner at that time (early May 2025 per Jason Vallery).
