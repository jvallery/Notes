# Jason offer decision discussion

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Account**: [[Jai Menon]]
**Attendees**: Jai Menon, Jason Vallery

## Summary

Jason discussed two external offers: a complex, high-variance compensation offer from VAST and an expiring offer from Crusoe. Microsoft was deemed not viable due to unclear Apollo scope and limited compensation levers; Jai agreed not to push Manish for a small adjustment that could be perceived as insulting. Jason planned final diligence with VAST’s CEO to quantify risk and likely decide between VAST and Crusoe within the week, then update Jai.
## Action Items
- [?] Meet VAST CEO Renan to quantify offer risks and discuss adjustments to commission and equity terms. @Myself 📅 2025-10-26 🔺 #task #proposed
- [?] Negotiate specific compensation tweaks with VAST (commission basis and equity size) to reduce downside risk. @Myself 📅 2025-10-26 🔺 #task #proposed
- [?] Decide between VAST and Crusoe and prepare next steps (including resignation if applicable). @Myself 📅 2025-10-26 🔺 #task #proposed
- [?] Update Jai with final decision and timing (including resignation plan if leaving Microsoft). @Myself 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task #proposed

## Decisions
- Do not pursue Microsoft compensation changes for Jason.
- Jason will proceed with final diligence on VAST and decide between VAST and Crusoe.

## Key Information
- Jason has a VAST offer with compensation tied to a percentage of sales to OpenAI and on Azure; equity component was initially disappointing.
- Crusoe offer has a deadline around Wednesday; VAST did not set a deadline.
- Jason estimates leaving Microsoft forfeits ~800K in vested value, narrowing the perceived gap with external offers.
- Microsoft Apollo scope is unclear with many stakeholders; timing is tight relative to data center go-lives.
- Manish likely cannot offer compensation competitive with external offers; any adjustment would be modest and could be perceived as insulting.
- Jason prioritizes clear scope, ownership, and a path to Partner; he does not see that at Microsoft currently.
- VAST role would report to Jeff and Renan, include PM ownership for a cloud control plane with the Red Stapler team, support Microsoft sell-to/sell-with, and dotted-line involvement with OpenAI Project Stargate.
- VAST acquired Red Stapler (founded by Jan C. Stefansson) to build a cloud control plane.
- VAST compensation variability is described as potentially between zero and many millions, creating lifestyle risk.
