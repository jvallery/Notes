## Key Facts

- Silk is software-defined cloud storage optimized for database and single source-of-truth workloads.
- Typical scale cited: up to ~1 PB per data pod with tens of GB/s throughput and sub-ms latency.
- Silk cited ~2–3M TPS with 64k transactions and noted single-VM DB performance is often the limiting factor.
- Architecture: performance layer near DB VMs (PPG) with read cache; durable layer on Azure PV2 with added erasure coding or on VMs with ephemeral media; compression and optional dedupe.
- Silk often competes with Azure NetApp Files and claims it can outperform ANF Ultra at lower cost for certain DB workloads.
- Silk wants RDMA on the front end of Azure L-series to reduce CPU overhead; they are working with Gal Piglin’s team.
- AI workloads (RAG/agentic) are increasing unpredictable access to production relational databases (SQL/Oracle/Postgres).
- Two access patterns discussed: maximize production DB performance vs create near-real-time copies (tens of seconds) for AI access.
- Silk is software-defined cloud storage optimized for structured relational DB workloads across Azure/GCP/AWS.
- A single Silk data pod supports ~1–500 databases up to ~1 PB with n+x resilience and read cache (cNodes).

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Proceed with connecting to Jai Menon through Ong.
- ✅ Proceed with setting up a CEO-level introduction to Jai Menon.
- ✅ Evaluate use case fit per customer: accelerate production DB vs near-real-time cloned copies.
- ✅ Do not pursue Microsoft compensation changes for Jason.
- ✅ Jason to proceed with final diligence on VAST and decide between VAST and Crusoe.
- ✅ Do not pursue an internal compensation/scope package at this time.
- ✅ Jason will not stay at Microsoft.
- ✅ Jason will choose between VAST and Crusoe by 2025-10-08 (leaning VAST pending de-risking).
- ✅ Do not pursue a Microsoft counteroffer given compensation constraints and unclear scope.
- ✅ Proceed toward a decision between VAST and Crusoe with intent to resign by Wednesday.
