# Jai Menon

## Key Facts

- Jay Menon is involved on the Microsoft Apollo team on the storage side.

- Jai Menon indicated that any compensation adjustment Maneesh Sah could make for Jason Vallery at Microsoft would likely be modest and could be perceived as insulting compared to external offers.

- Jai Menon and Maneesh Sah discussed role scope for Jason Vallery, including a question of whether Jason would manage a development team versus a product management team, and noted limited experience with Jason managing a development team.

- Jai Menon scheduled a team offsite in Silicon Valley for 2025-10-15 with a day-and-a-half format, light schedule, and a social event or dinner on day 1, with an early departure around noon on day 2.

- Jai Menon planned a team offsite in Silicon Valley starting Wednesday 2025-10-15 for approximately 1.5 days, with a social event or dinner on day 1 and a half-day session on day 2 so attendees can fly home around noon.

- Jai Menon chose Silicon Valley rather than Redmond for the offsite to enable his team to meet DPU engineers and learn about the DPU roadmap and the FunOS programming environment.

- Jai Menon planned to invite an inferencing leader named Rajat Monga to discuss inferencing, KV caching, and how inferencing fits into the OpenAI inferencing framework (not open source).

- Jai Menon believes Apollo needs a clean-sheet approach and noted that internal politics and pace are known challenges.

- Jai Menon previously received career advice from Juergen to obtain a competitive external offer to enable Microsoft to match compensation; Jai used an Amazon offer to secure a large stock grant that vests over a four-year cycle.

- Ong told Silk he wanted to introduce them to Jay Menon, and Silk had not previously heard of or spoken with Jay Menon before that conversation.

- A Silk contact (Ong, exact identity unknown) told Silk they wanted to introduce Silk to Jay Menon, and the group viewed this as a key next step.

- Jai Menon is involved on Microsoft's Apollo team on the storage side.

- Jai Menon expressed a preference for a single, pluggable cache that can serve both training workloads (including checkpoint and find-data) and inference workloads (KB cache), rather than multiple bespoke caches.

- Jai Menon expressed a design preference for a single unified cache that supports both training and inference, including KB caching, and is pluggable across frameworks.

- Jai Menon indicated Microsoft could likely not assemble a compensation package competitive with Jason Vallery's external offers, and that even a materially higher number would take significant effort and still risk appearing insulting relative to a ~$2M external offer.

- Jai Menon confirmed a Microsoft Apollo team offsite in Silicon Valley on 2025-10-15 for approximately 1.5 days, with casual sessions, a social/dinner on day 1, and release around noon on day 2.

- Jai Menon chose Silicon Valley (instead of Redmond) for the 2025-10-15 offsite to enable the team to meet DPU/FunOS stakeholders and learn about upcoming chip directions and the FunOS programming environment.

- Jai Menon believes Microsoft cannot approach Crusoe-level compensation for Jason Vallery, and any potential adjustment would be modest and could be perceived as insulting.

- Jai Menon indicated there is internal discussion about whether Jason Vallery would manage a development team versus a product management team, and that Microsoft has more evidence of Jason's success on the PM side than managing a dev team.

- Jai Menon described a strategic preference for a single caching solution usable for both training and inference, and for the cache to be pluggable rather than tightly coupled to a single framework.

- Jai Menon believed any Microsoft retention compensation package would be modest relative to Jason Vallery's external offers and could be perceived as insulting, so he was reluctant to push for it.

- Ong (last name unknown) told Silk he wanted to introduce them to Jay Menon at Microsoft, and Silk had not previously interacted with Jay Menon before that suggestion.

- Jai Menon indicated he sent Jason Vallery a performance snapshot and offered to join conversations with Wang Xi and/or Ong, and supported escalation to Manish if needed.

## Key Decisions

- Jai Menon will not push Maneesh Sah to pursue a Microsoft compensation adjustment for Jason Vallery because any feasible adjustment would likely be modest and perceived as insulting relative to external offers.

- Jason Vallery will proceed to choose between the VAST Data offer and the Crusoe offer, with the Crusoe deadline driving near-term timing.

- Use a competitive external offer from Jason Vallery as the basis to evaluate a Microsoft retention path (scope, authority, and compensation).

- Keep communication open through the end of the week and reassess after Jason Vallery receives and shares his strongest written offer.

- Hold the team offsite in Silicon Valley on 2025-10-15 with a day-and-a-half agenda and optional social/dinner on day 1.

- Create a shared Microsoft Teams room to centralize distributed caching documents, links, and ongoing discussion.

- Jason Vallery will travel to the Silicon Valley team offsite starting Wednesday 2025-10-15 (approximately 1.5 days).

- The distributed cache workstream collateral (slides, comparison docs, links) will be centralized in a new shared Microsoft Teams space.

- The evaluation will be framed by fan-out writes, fan-out reads, and fan-in reads, with KV cache treated as a separate problem space.

- Jai Menon and Jason Vallery agreed to a wait-and-see approach until Jason Vallery makes an end-of-week decision on external offers, then revisit a Microsoft retention path.

- Jai Menon will brief Manish on Jason Vallery's expectations, concerns, and potential Apollo leadership considerations.

- Jason Vallery will evaluate OpenAI cache code as the first concrete step toward defining a unified MAI caching strategy.

- The unified cache design should prioritize MAI training use cases first, then add inference and knowledge base caching support.

- The cache solution must target AKS/Kubernetes with Spark and be evaluated for scalability to approximately 100k nodes.

- Jason Vallery will start by evaluating the OpenAI cache as the first concrete task for the MAI AI caching strategy, before selecting among alternatives (Blobfuse/Blockfuse, AC Store/C-Store, Alexio/DAX).

- The caching strategy should prioritize MAI training workloads first (checkpoint and find-data), with inference KB cache supported later.

- The preferred direction is a single, framework-pluggable cache rather than separate caches per use case.

- Near-term storage performance focus remains Bifrost (including a direct read path), with DeltaZero positioned as a follow-on.

- Jason Vallery will lead the evaluation of OpenAI’s caching code for potential use in MAI’s unified cache and compare it against BlobFuse, Alluxio/DAX, and AC Store.

- The preferred architecture direction is a single unified, framework-agnostic cache that can serve training first and later inference and KB caching.

- Near-term performance direction for Azure Blob is Bifrost (direct read path), with DeltaZero positioned as a follow-on.

- Do not pursue an internal Microsoft compensation change package at this time due to constraints and risk of an uncompetitive outcome.

- Jason Vallery will not stay at Microsoft given unclear Apollo scope and lack of a defined path to Partner.

- Jason Vallery will choose between the VAST Data offer and the Crusoe offer by 2025-10-08 and will update Jai Menon.

- Jason Vallery will book travel to attend the Microsoft Apollo team offsite in Silicon Valley on 2025-10-15.

- Do not pursue a Microsoft counteroffer for Jason Vallery because Microsoft compensation flexibility is limited and the Apollo program scope is unclear.

- Jason Vallery will proceed to decide between the VAST Data offer and the Crusoe offer by Wednesday, 2025-10-08.

- Jai Menon and Jason Vallery agreed to use Jason Vallery's best external written offer as a reference point for any Microsoft counteroffer and role discussion.

- Jai Menon will inform Manish Sah that Jason Vallery is targeting management roles and requires clear scope and ownership to consider staying.

- Prioritize a unified caching approach for Microsoft MAI, with training requirements addressed first and inference (including KB cache) following.

- Proceed with an initial feasibility evaluation of OpenAI cache IP for MAI-scale caching, in parallel with continued evaluation of Alluxio/DAX, C-Store proposals, and Blockfuse/BlobFuse approaches.

- Continue the Blob performance direction via Bifrost (including a direct read path), with DeltaZero considered as a subsequent step.

- Jai Menon will not pursue a Microsoft retention counteroffer with Manish because the likely compensation would be too small relative to external offers and could be perceived as insulting.

- Jason Vallery will choose between the VAST Data offer and the Crusoe offer by Wednesday 2025-10-08 and will proceed with resignation from Microsoft if accepting an external offer.

- Primary focus for the MAI caching workstream is training cache requirements first, with inference KB caching to follow after.

- Target architecture direction is a unified, pluggable cache design that can support multiple frameworks (not tied to a single training framework).

- Jason Vallery will prioritize evaluation of the OpenAI caching solution while tracking alternative options (BlobFuse/Blockfuse, AC Store, Alluxio/DAX).
