# 1:1 with Jai Menon: Jason weighing VAST vs Crusoe; Microsoft Apollo scope and comp constraints

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jai Menon

## Summary

Jason Vallery told Jai Menon he has a complex, high-variance VAST Data offer and an expiring Crusoe offer, and that staying at Microsoft is not viable due to unclear Apollo scope and limited compensation levers. Jai acknowledged the constraints and agreed not to push Maneesh Sah for a small compensation adjustment that would likely be perceived as insulting. Jason will complete diligence with VAST leadership, quantify downside risk, decide between VAST and Crusoe, and then update Jai.


## Action Items


- [?] Complete final diligence on the VAST Data offer by quantifying downside risk and clarifying the real expected value of the high-variance compensation structure. @Myself 📅 2025-10-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Decide between the VAST Data offer and the Crusoe offer, with the Crusoe offer deadline around Wednesday (relative to 2025-10-06) driving the decision timeline. @Myself 📅 2025-10-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Update Jai Menon with the final decision and timing, including a resignation plan if leaving Microsoft. @Myself 📅 2025-10-09 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Jai Menon will not push Maneesh Sah to pursue a Microsoft compensation adjustment for Jason Vallery because any feasible adjustment would likely be modest and perceived as insulting relative to external offers.

- Jason Vallery will proceed to choose between the VAST Data offer and the Crusoe offer, with the Crusoe deadline driving near-term timing.




## Key Information


- Jason Vallery received a complex VAST Data offer with multiple compensation components that are difficult to value, creating high variance in expected outcomes.

- Jason Vallery has an expiring offer from Crusoe with a deadline around Wednesday (relative to the 2025-10-06 meeting date).

- VAST Data did not provide Jason Vallery a formal deadline for accepting the offer at the time of the 2025-10-06 conversation.

- Jai Menon indicated that any compensation adjustment Maneesh Sah could make for Jason Vallery at Microsoft would likely be modest and could be perceived as insulting compared to external offers.

- Jason Vallery estimated that leaving Microsoft would forfeit approximately $800K of vested value, which narrows the perceived gap between Microsoft and external offers.

- Jason Vallery stated that unclear scope and ownership for the Microsoft Apollo initiative is a primary blocker to staying at Microsoft, with compensation being secondary to having clear deliverables and a path to Partner.

- Jai Menon and Maneesh Sah discussed role scope for Jason Vallery, including a question of whether Jason would manage a development team versus a product management team, and noted limited experience with Jason managing a development team.
