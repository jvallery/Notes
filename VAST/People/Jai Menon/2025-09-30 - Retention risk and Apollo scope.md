# Retention risk and Apollo scope

**Date**: 2025-09-30
**Account**: [[Jai Menon]]
**Attendees**: Jai Menon, Jason Vallery

## Summary

Jason Vallery shared he is actively exploring external management-role opportunities after a disappointing rewards outcome and lack of storage leadership advocacy, and expects strong offers soon. To consider staying, he needs a management role with clear scope/ownership, executive backing, and industry-level compensation; Jai will brief Maneesh/Manish and wait for Jason’s best offer to discuss a path forward. They also aligned that Apollo likely requires a clean-sheet storage approach, with concerns about politics, execution speed, and a 2–3 year new-stack timeline versus near-term datacenter needs.
## Action Items
- [ ] Share Jason’s expectations (management role, clear scope/ownership, executive backing, industry-level compensation) and additional context with Manish/Maneesh. @Jai 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Provide best external offer details and a clear list of requirements to stay (scope, ownership, collaborators, resourcing, compensation) to Jai and Manish/Maneesh once offers are in writing. @Jason Vallery 📅 2025-10-26 🔺 #task
- [ ] Clarify proposed Apollo scope, PM ownership, collaborators, funding/resourcing model, and executive support if Jason stays. @Manish 📅 2025-10-26 🔺 #task
- [ ] Schedule a follow-up discussion with Jason after offers are in to negotiate role, scope, and compensation. @Jai 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task

## Decisions
- Use Jason’s best external offer as a reference point for potential Microsoft counter and role discussion.
- Jai will inform Manish/Maneesh that Jason is targeting management roles and needs clear ownership/scope.

## Key Information
- Jason has been at Microsoft for 13 years and previously had an Amazon offer matched by Juergen via a large stock grant (vesting cycle nearing completion).
- Jason is pursuing four external opportunities; two are likely and include verbal commitments, with expectation of a strong written offer after a CEO conversation.
- Jason does not want to remain an IC; he wants a management role and the ability to execute with clear ownership and latitude.
- Key retention risks cited: disappointing rewards, lack of storage leadership advocate since Juergen left, organizational politics/territorialism, and industry instability/layoffs.
- Apollo storage concern: new clean-sheet storage stack likely 2–3 years out while datacenters are being built now; near-term storage solution is unclear.
- Both participants believe a Bifrost-only approach is unlikely to be competitive; clean-sheet is required for Apollo success.
