# 1:1 with Jai Menon: retention discussion, external offers, and Apollo clean-sheet storage concerns

**Date**: 2025-09-30
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jai Menon, Maneesh Sah, Unknown person (Ong), Juergen (last name unknown), Pete Emig

## Summary

Jason Vallery told Jai Menon he started exploring external opportunities after a disappointing rewards outcome and now expects a strong offer soon, with a decision targeted by the end of the week. Jason’s stay criteria include a management role with clear scope and decision authority, latitude to execute, and competitive compensation; Jai will brief Manish Sah and evaluate a retention path. They also discussed Apollo, aligning that a clean-sheet storage approach is likely required and that timing is risky relative to near-term datacenter buildouts.

## Action Items

## Decisions

## Key Information

- Jason Vallery has been at Microsoft for 13 years and previously expected to stay long-term in Azure Storage before recent events changed his outlook.

- Jason Vallery interpreted a recent rewards outcome and conversation with an executive named Ong as a signal that he should look for a new job, and he feels he lacks an advocate in Microsoft storage leadership since Juergen left.

- Jason Vallery is pursuing four external opportunities, has ruled out two, and expects at least one strong written offer after a CEO call; he plans to decide by the end of the week once paperwork is complete.

- Jason Vallery’s stay criteria include a management or leadership role (not an individual contributor role), clear scope and ownership, decision latitude to execute, and compensation at industry-competitive levels.

- Jason Vallery is not interested in moving to another hyperscaler and is more likely to join a smaller, faster-moving company if he leaves Microsoft.

- Jason Vallery believes Apollo will likely require a clean-sheet storage approach to be competitive, and he is concerned that near-term datacenter buildouts may outpace readiness of a new storage solution; build vs buy or partner remains open.

- Juergen (last name unknown) previously advised Jason Vallery to obtain a competitive external offer and then matched it with a large stock grant; that four-year grant is expected to complete vesting in a few months from 2025-09-30.

- Jason Vallery met Pete Emig through an Amazon interview process for an S3 product manager role; Jason later hired Pete Emig at Microsoft.
