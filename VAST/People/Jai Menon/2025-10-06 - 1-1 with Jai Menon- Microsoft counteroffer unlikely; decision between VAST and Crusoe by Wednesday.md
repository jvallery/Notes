# 1:1 with Jai Menon: Microsoft counteroffer unlikely; decision between VAST and Crusoe by Wednesday

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jai Menon

## Summary

Jason Vallery briefed Jai Menon on external offers from VAST Data and Crusoe, emphasizing that VAST's offer has complex, variable compensation and Crusoe has a Wednesday deadline. Jai Menon shared that Microsoft cannot craft a competitive compensation package and that the Apollo program scope is still unclear, making it hard to define a successful role or path to partner. Jason Vallery indicated the Microsoft option is effectively closed and will decide between VAST and Crusoe after further negotiation with VAST leadership.


## Action Items


- [?] Negotiate with VAST Data leadership to quantify and reduce compensation risk in the VAST Data offer (variable components and overall structure). @Myself 📅 2025-10-07 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Decide between the VAST Data offer and the Crusoe offer by the Crusoe deadline. @Myself 📅 2025-10-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Update Jai Menon on final decision and status after completing discussions with VAST Data and Crusoe. @Myself 📅 2025-10-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Do not pursue a Microsoft counteroffer for Jason Vallery because Microsoft compensation flexibility is limited and the Apollo program scope is unclear.

- Jason Vallery will proceed to decide between the VAST Data offer and the Crusoe offer by Wednesday, 2025-10-08.




## Key Information


- Jason Vallery received an offer from VAST Data with complex, highly variable compensation components that are difficult to value.

- Jason Vallery has an offer from Crusoe with a decision deadline on Wednesday, 2025-10-08.

- VAST Data did not provide Jason Vallery a decision deadline at the time of this meeting.

- Jai Menon believes Microsoft cannot approach Crusoe-level compensation for Jason Vallery, and any potential adjustment would be modest and could be perceived as insulting.

- Jai Menon stated the Apollo program scope is still in flux, which makes it difficult to define Jason Vallery's role scope and success criteria at Microsoft.

- Jason Vallery prioritizes having clear scope, owning deliverables, doing hands-on technical work, and influencing customer deals when evaluating roles.

- Jason Vallery estimated he would forfeit approximately $800,000 of vested compensation if he leaves Microsoft, which narrows the effective gap versus external offers.

- Jai Menon indicated there is internal discussion about whether Jason Vallery would manage a development team versus a product management team, and that Microsoft has more evidence of Jason's success on the PM side than managing a dev team.
