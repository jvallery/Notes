# 1:1 with Jai Menon: Microsoft retention not viable; decision between VAST and Crusoe by 2025-10-08

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jai Menon

## Summary

Jason Vallery told Jai Menon he has a complex, high-variance compensation offer from VAST Data and a more stable offer from Crusoe with a decision deadline of Wednesday 2025-10-08. Jai confirmed Microsoft cannot provide competitive compensation or a clear scope and path to partner because Apollo remains undefined, and agreed not to pursue a likely-insulting counteroffer; Jason planned to decide by Wednesday and likely resign if taking an external offer.

## Action Items

- [?] Decide between the VAST Data offer and the Crusoe offer by Wednesday 2025-10-08, and prepare resignation from Microsoft if accepting an external offer. @Myself 📅 2025-10-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Update Jai Menon after finalizing the decision process and confirm resignation timing if leaving Microsoft. @Myself 📅 2025-10-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Stop pursuing a Microsoft compensation adjustment/retention package for Jason Vallery with Maneesh Sah due to low likelihood of a competitive offer. @Jai Menon #task #proposed #auto

## Decisions

- Jai Menon decided not to push Maneesh Sah to produce a Microsoft retention counteroffer because it would likely be too small to retain Jason Vallery and could be perceived as insulting.

- Jason Vallery decided he will choose between the VAST Data offer and the Crusoe offer by Wednesday 2025-10-08, and will likely resign from Microsoft if he accepts an external offer.

## Key Information

- Crusoe required Jason Vallery to decide by Wednesday 2025-10-08, while VAST Data did not provide a deadline for its offer.

- Jai Menon indicated Microsoft could only offer a modest compensation adjustment relative to Jason Vallery's external offers, and that Manish (Maneesh Sah) was concerned a counteroffer would look insulting and not retain Jason.

- The Microsoft 'Apollo' initiative scope was described as still in flux, with unclear boundaries and stakeholders, making it hard to define Jason Vallery's role and success criteria.

- Jai Menon said Microsoft had seen Jason Vallery be successful on product management work, but had limited experience with him managing a development team, which was part of the role-scope discussion for Apollo.

- Jason Vallery stated he would forfeit approximately $800K of already-invested Microsoft compensation (described as invested/vested value) if he left Microsoft.

- Jason Vallery stated he prioritizes having clear ownership, deliverables, and an upward career trajectory, including a clear path to partner at Microsoft, and that lack of scope clarity was a primary blocker to staying.

- Jason Vallery reported that in an early May 2025 conversation, Maneesh Sah said he would talk to Girish about a path to partner, but Jason did not receive a concrete follow-up before his sabbatical.
