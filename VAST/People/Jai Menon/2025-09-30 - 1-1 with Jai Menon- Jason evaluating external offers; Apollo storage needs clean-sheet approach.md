# 1:1 with Jai Menon: Jason evaluating external offers; Apollo storage needs clean-sheet approach

**Date**: 2025-09-30
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jai Menon

## Summary

Jason Vallery told Jai Menon he started exploring external opportunities after a disappointing rewards outcome and now expects strong offers. Jason said he would consider staying at Microsoft only with a management role, clear scope and ownership, executive advocacy, and industry-competitive compensation; Jai agreed to brief Manish Sah and revisit once Jason has written offers. Both aligned that Apollo storage likely requires a clean-sheet design and that politics and execution speed are major risks.


## Action Items


- [?] Share Jason Vallery's expectations (management role, clear scope and ownership, executive advocacy, and industry-level compensation) and additional context with Manish Sah. @Jai Menon 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide Jai Menon and Manish Sah the best external written offer and a clear list of requirements for Jason Vallery to stay (scope, ownership, collaborators, resourcing, and compensation). @Myself 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Clarify proposed Apollo scope, PM ownership model, key collaborators, funding, and executive support if Jason Vallery stays at Microsoft. @Maneesh Sah 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Send end-of-week update to Jai Menon on external offers status and Jason Vallery's decision path (stay vs leave). @Myself 📅 2025-10-26 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule a follow-up discussion with Jason Vallery after written offers are received to negotiate role, scope, and compensation expectations. @Jai Menon 📅 2025-10-26 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Jai Menon and Jason Vallery agreed to use Jason Vallery's best external written offer as a reference point for any Microsoft counteroffer and role discussion.

- Jai Menon will inform Manish Sah that Jason Vallery is targeting management roles and requires clear scope and ownership to consider staying.




## Key Information


- Jason Vallery has been at Microsoft for 13 years and previously expected to retire from Azure Storage.

- Jason Vallery previously obtained an Amazon offer that Juergen (last name not stated) matched with a large stock grant; the grant was on a four-year vesting cycle nearing completion.

- Jason Vallery met Pete Emig through the Amazon interview process and later hired him at Microsoft.

- After meeting with Ong (full name not stated) and seeing his rewards outcome, Jason Vallery interpreted leadership signals as a prompt to look externally and began pursuing outside roles.

- Jason Vallery reported four external opportunities, with two likely contenders, including verbal commitments and expectation of a strong written offer after speaking with a CEO (company not stated).

- Jason Vallery said he lacks an advocate in Microsoft storage leadership since Juergen left, and he is concerned about organizational politics and territorial behavior impacting execution.

- Jason Vallery stated he wants a management role (not an individual contributor role), clear scope and ownership, latitude to execute, runway and stability, and industry-level compensation to consider staying at Microsoft.

- Jason Vallery believes the broader tech industry is unstable due to layoffs; he cited having to lay off a recently hired team member whose spouse also worked at Microsoft and both were laid off the same day.

- Jai Menon and Jason Vallery aligned that Microsoft Apollo storage likely needs a clean-sheet storage design and that a Bifrost-only approach is unlikely to be competitive; they discussed a 2 to 3 year timeline risk for a new storage stack versus data centers being built now.
