# 1:1 with Jai Menon: Microsoft counteroffer not viable; decision between VAST and Crusoe by Wednesday

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jai Menon, Maneesh Sah, Unknown person referred to as "Manish" (likely Maneesh Sah), Unknown person referred to as "Ganesh", Unknown person referred to as "Girish", Unknown person referred to as "Aung", Unknown person referred to as "Bombshe", Unknown person referred to as "Renan" (VAST CEO per notes)

## Summary

Jason Vallery briefed Jai Menon on job offers from VAST Data and Crusoe, emphasizing that VAST’s compensation is complex and variable while Crusoe has a Wednesday deadline. Jai Menon shared that Microsoft cannot craft a competitive counteroffer and that Apollo scope remains unclear, making it hard to define a successful role or path to partner. They aligned that Jason will decide between VAST and Crusoe and update Jai after discussions with VAST leadership.


## Action Items


- [?] Meet with Renan (identified in notes as VAST Data CEO) to quantify compensation risk in the VAST Data offer and negotiate terms (equity and variable compensation components). @Myself 📅 2025-10-07 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Decide between the VAST Data offer and the Crusoe offer by the Crusoe deadline (Wednesday, 2025-10-08). @Myself 📅 2025-10-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Update Jai Menon on final decision and resignation plan after completing discussions with VAST Data and Crusoe. @Myself 📅 2025-10-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Jai Menon will not push Maneesh Sah to produce a modest Microsoft counteroffer for Jason Vallery because it is unlikely to be competitive and risks being perceived as insulting.

- Jason Vallery will proceed to choose between the VAST Data offer and the Crusoe offer, driven by the Crusoe Wednesday deadline (2025-10-08).




## Key Information


- Jason Vallery received an offer from VAST Data with multiple compensation components that are difficult to value and include highly variable elements.

- Jason Vallery has an offer from Crusoe with a decision deadline on Wednesday (relative to 2025-10-06, this implies 2025-10-08).

- VAST Data did not provide Jason Vallery a decision deadline at the time of this conversation.

- Jai Menon believes Microsoft cannot approach Crusoe-level compensation for Jason Vallery and any potential adjustment would be modest and could be perceived as insulting.

- Jai Menon stated that the Apollo program scope is still in flux, which makes it difficult to define Jason Vallery’s role scope and success criteria at Microsoft.

- Jai Menon and others have seen Jason Vallery be successful managing product management work, but they have limited experience seeing him manage a development team.

- Jason Vallery estimates he would forfeit approximately $800,000 of vested compensation by leaving Microsoft, which narrows the effective gap versus external offers.

- Jason Vallery prioritizes having clear ownership of scope and deliverables, hands-on technical work, and the ability to influence customer deals, and he wants a clear path to partner if staying at Microsoft.

- Jason Vallery previously approached a Microsoft leader referred to as "Manish" about switching teams and asked for clarity on scope and a path to partner; "Manish" said he would talk to "Girish" about partner.
