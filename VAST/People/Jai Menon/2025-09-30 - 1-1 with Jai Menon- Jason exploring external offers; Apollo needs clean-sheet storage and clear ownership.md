# 1:1 with Jai Menon: Jason exploring external offers; Apollo needs clean-sheet storage and clear ownership

**Date**: 2025-09-30
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jai Menon, Manish Sah, Ong (last name unknown), Juergen (last name unknown), Pete Emig

## Summary

Jason Vallery told Jai Menon he began exploring external opportunities after a disappointing rewards outcome and now expects strong offers. Jason said he would consider staying at Microsoft only with a management role, clear scope and ownership, executive advocacy, and industry-competitive compensation; Jai planned to brief Manish Sah and revisit once Jason has written offers.


## Action Items


- [?] Share Jason Vallery's expectations for staying at Microsoft (management role, clear scope and ownership, executive advocacy, and industry-level compensation) with Manish Sah, including additional context from the 1:1. @Jai Menon 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide Jai Menon and Manish Sah with Jason Vallery's best external written offer details and a clear list of requirements to stay (scope, ownership, collaborators, resourcing, and compensation). @Myself 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Clarify the proposed Apollo scope, product management ownership, key collaborators, funding, and executive support package if Jason Vallery stays in the role. @Maneesh Sah 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Send an end-of-week update to Jai Menon on external offer status and Jason Vallery's decision path (stay vs leave) once written offers are received. @Myself 📅 2025-10-26 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule a follow-up discussion with Jason Vallery after written offers are in to negotiate role, scope, and compensation expectations. @Jai Menon 📅 2025-10-26 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Jai Menon and Jason Vallery agreed to use Jason Vallery's best external written offer as the reference point for any Microsoft counteroffer discussion and role/scope negotiation.

- Jai Menon will inform Manish Sah that Jason Vallery is targeting a management role and requires clear scope and ownership to consider staying.




## Key Information


- Jason Vallery has been at Microsoft for 13 years and previously expected to stay in Azure Storage long-term (potentially until at least age 55).

- Jason Vallery previously received an Amazon offer for a Product Manager role on Amazon S3, and Juergen (last name unknown) matched it with a large stock grant that vests over a four-year cycle.

- Jason Vallery said he felt he lacked an advocate in Microsoft storage leadership after Juergen (last name unknown) left/retired, and he interpreted a recent rewards outcome as a signal to look for a new job.

- Jason Vallery said he is pursuing external opportunities and has four external options, with two likely contenders; he expects a strong written offer after additional executive conversations and has already received verbal commitments.

- Jason Vallery said he will only consider staying if he has clear scope and ownership, latitude to execute, a management role (not an individual contributor role), executive backing/advocacy, and industry-level compensation.

- Jason Vallery expressed concern that organizational politics and territorial behavior among stakeholders could slow execution and undermine his ability to own and deliver outcomes.

- Jason Vallery and Jai Menon aligned that the Microsoft Apollo storage effort likely requires a clean-sheet storage design, and a Bifrost-only approach is unlikely to be competitive.

- Jason Vallery raised a timeline risk for Apollo: a new storage stack could take 2 to 3 years, while Apollo data centers are being built now, creating a near-term gap.

- Jason Vallery said industry instability and layoffs influenced his decision to explore external opportunities; he cited an example where a newly hired team member and the team member's spouse (both Microsoft employees) were laid off on the same day.

- Jason Vallery said he met with Ong (last name unknown) about two weeks before this 1:1 and then scheduled a 1:1 with Manish Sah to discuss Apollo and his fit.
