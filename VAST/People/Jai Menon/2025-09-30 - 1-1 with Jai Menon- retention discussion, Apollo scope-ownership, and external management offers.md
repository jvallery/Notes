# 1:1 with Jai Menon: retention discussion, Apollo scope/ownership, and external management offers

**Date**: 2025-09-30
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jai Menon

## Summary

Jason Vallery told Jai Menon he has multiple external management offers and plans to decide by end of week, with clear ownership/scope, latitude to execute, stability, and competitive compensation as top priorities. Jason is open to staying at Microsoft if Apollo role scope, leadership advocacy, and rewards can be addressed; Jai will brief Manish and continue the conversation once Jason has a best offer and retention asks.

## Decisions

## Key Information


- Jason Vallery has been at Microsoft for 13 years and recently returned from a sabbatical.

- Jason Vallery previously led a team of 20+ people at Microsoft and does not want to remain in an individual contributor role; he is seeking a management role.

- Jason Vallery felt under-recognized in rewards and without an advocate in Microsoft storage leadership after Juergen left.

- Jason Vallery has four external opportunities, all management-oriented; two are strong contenders and he expects to decide by the end of the week.

- Jason Vallery's top priorities for staying or leaving Microsoft are clear ownership and scope, latitude to execute, leadership buy-in and advocacy, stability/runway, and industry-level compensation.

- Jason Vallery is interested in the Microsoft Apollo initiative but needs clarity on product management ownership, collaborators, resourcing, and executive support.

- Jason Vallery is concerned that Microsoft storage infrastructure timelines versus new data center buildouts could mean a new storage stack is 2-3 years behind near-term data center needs.

- Jai Menon believes Apollo needs a clean-sheet approach and noted that internal politics and pace are known challenges.

- Jason Vallery is not interested in moving to another hyperscaler; if he leaves Microsoft he prefers a smaller, faster-moving company.

- Jai Menon previously received career advice from Juergen to obtain a competitive external offer to enable Microsoft to match compensation; Jai used an Amazon offer to secure a large stock grant that vests over a four-year cycle.
