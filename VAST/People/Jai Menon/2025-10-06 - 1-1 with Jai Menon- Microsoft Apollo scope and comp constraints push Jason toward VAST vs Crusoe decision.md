# 1:1 with Jai Menon: Microsoft Apollo scope and comp constraints push Jason toward VAST vs Crusoe decision

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jai Menon

## Summary

Jason Vallery discussed competing offers from VAST Data and Crusoe and concluded staying at Microsoft is not viable due to unclear Apollo scope and inability to assemble competitive compensation. Jai Menon confirmed Microsoft compensation flexibility is limited and Apollo scope remains in flux. Jason planned to meet VAST CEO Renan on 2025-10-07 to de-risk the offer and decide by the Crusoe deadline on 2025-10-08, then update Jai.


## Action Items


- [?] Meet with Renan (VAST Data CEO) to quantify compensation risk and negotiate terms for the VAST Data offer. @Myself 📅 2025-10-07 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Decide between VAST Data and Crusoe offers based on compensation risk, scope, and career trajectory considerations. @Myself 📅 2025-10-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Notify Jai Menon of the final decision and, if leaving Microsoft, submit resignation. @Myself 📅 2025-10-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Be available for clarification or references as Jason Vallery finalizes his decision between VAST Data and Crusoe. @Jai Menon 🔽 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Do not pursue an internal Microsoft compensation change package at this time due to constraints and risk of an uncompetitive outcome.

- Jason Vallery will not stay at Microsoft given unclear Apollo scope and lack of a defined path to Partner.

- Jason Vallery will choose between the VAST Data offer and the Crusoe offer by 2025-10-08 and will update Jai Menon.




## Key Information


- Crusoe offer decision deadline for Jason Vallery was Wednesday, 2025-10-08; VAST Data did not provide a deadline at the time of the call.

- Jason Vallery had an offer from VAST Data with multiple compensation components that were difficult to value, including sales-linked commission-like upside.

- Jai Menon indicated Microsoft could likely not assemble a compensation package competitive with Jason Vallery's external offers, and that even a materially higher number would take significant effort and still risk appearing insulting relative to a ~$2M external offer.

- Apollo scope at Microsoft was described as still in flux, with uncertainty about role expectations (managing a development team vs managing a PM team).

- Jason Vallery stated he would forfeit approximately $800K of vested compensation if he left Microsoft, reducing the incremental gap versus a ~$2M external offer to roughly $1.1M-$1.2M.

- Jason Vallery emphasized that clear scope, ownership of deliverables, and a defined path to Partner at Microsoft were more important than incremental compensation, and he did not see a concrete path at the time of the call.

- Jason Vallery reported that when he approached Manish (likely Maneesh Sah) in early May 2025 about switching teams, Manish said he would talk to Girish about a Partner path, but Jason did not receive a concrete outcome.
