# 1:1 with Jai Menon: retention discussion, external offers, and Apollo clean-sheet storage risk

**Date**: 2025-09-30
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jai Menon, Manish Sah, Ong (last name unknown), Juergen (last name unknown), Pete Emig

## Summary

Jason Vallery told Jai Menon he is actively evaluating external offers after a disappointing Microsoft rewards outcome and lack of perceived advocacy in Azure Storage leadership. Jason wants a management role with clear scope and decision authority, plus industry-competitive compensation, and will share his strongest offer before deciding by end of week. They aligned that Apollo likely needs a clean-sheet storage approach, but timing is risky relative to near-term datacenter buildouts.


## Action Items


- [?] Brief Manish Sah on Jason Vallery's expectations for a retention path, including management role, clear scope and ownership for Apollo, decision authority, and competitive compensation. @Jai Menon 📅 2025-10-03 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Send the strongest external offer package and explicit stay requirements (scope and ownership, collaborators, resourcing, compensation) to Jai Menon and Manish Sah once paperwork is finalized. @Myself 📅 2025-10-03 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Clarify product management ownership, decision authority, key stakeholders, and funding model for Apollo if Microsoft pursues a retention path for Jason Vallery. @Manish Sah 📅 2025-10-03 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide a decision update to Jai Menon by end of week after external offers are finalized. @Myself 📅 2025-10-03 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Use a competitive external offer from Jason Vallery as the basis to evaluate a Microsoft retention path (scope, authority, and compensation).

- Keep communication open through the end of the week and reassess after Jason Vallery receives and shares his strongest written offer.




## Key Information


- Jason Vallery has been at Microsoft for 13 years and previously expected to retire from Azure Storage.

- Jason Vallery believes he lacks an advocate in Azure Storage leadership since Juergen (last name unknown) left.

- Jason Vallery started exploring external opportunities after a meeting with Ong (last name unknown) and dissatisfaction with his Microsoft rewards outcome.

- Jason Vallery wants clear ownership and scope, explicit priorities, and latitude to execute, and he prefers a management or leadership role rather than an individual contributor role.

- Jason Vallery considers compensation and stability (runway) as key decision factors, and he wants industry-level compensation parity.

- Jason Vallery is not interested in moving to another hyperscaler and is more likely to join a smaller, faster-moving company.

- Jason Vallery described four external opportunities, with two likely ruled out and two still viable, including verbal commitments and an expected strong written offer after a CEO call.

- Jason Vallery plans to make a decision by the end of the week and will share his strongest external offer once paperwork is finalized.

- Juergen (last name unknown) previously advised Jason Vallery to get a competitive offer and he would match it, which resulted in a large stock grant that vests over a four-year cycle completing soon.

- Jason Vallery previously received an Amazon offer for a Product Manager role on S3, which he used to secure a matched package at Microsoft; during that process he met Pete Emig and later hired him.

- Jason Vallery and Jai Menon discussed Apollo and shared a belief that a clean-sheet storage approach is likely required to be competitive, with concern that new storage readiness may not align with near-term datacenter buildouts.
