# 1:1 with Jai Menon: Jason evaluating external management offers, retention conditions tied to Apollo scope and rewards

**Date**: 2025-09-30
**With**: Jason Vallery, Jai Menon, Maneesh Sah, Ong (last name unknown), Juergen (last name unknown), Pete Emig

## Summary

Jason Vallery told Jai Menon he has multiple external management offers and plans to decide by the end of the week, with retention contingent on clear ownership and scope, latitude to execute, stability, and competitive compensation. Apollo is interesting to Jason, but he needs clarity on PM ownership, collaborators, resourcing, and executive sponsorship; Jai will brief Maneesh Sah and continue the retention conversation once Jason has a best offer and specific asks.

## Key Information

- Jason Vallery has been at Microsoft for 13 years and recently returned from a sabbatical.

- Jason Vallery previously led a 20+ person team at Microsoft and later shifted into an individual contributor role, and he does not want to remain an individual contributor.

- Jason Vallery believes he has lacked an advocate in Microsoft storage leadership since Juergen (last name unknown) left, and he felt under-recognized in rewards.

- Jason Vallery has four external opportunities, all management-oriented, and expects to choose by the end of the week; he may present his best external offer to support a Microsoft counteroffer discussion.

- Jason Vallery's top priorities for staying are clear ownership and scope, latitude to execute, leadership buy-in and advocacy, stability and runway, and industry-level compensation.

- Jason Vallery is interested in the Microsoft Apollo initiative but needs clarity on product management ownership, collaborators, resourcing, and executive support.

- Jason Vallery is concerned that new data center buildouts may outpace delivery of a new storage stack by 2 to 3 years, creating a timeline mismatch for Apollo.

- Jai Menon believes Apollo needs a clean-sheet approach and that internal politics and pace are known challenges.

- Jason Vallery is not interested in moving to another hyperscaler and would prefer a smaller, faster-moving company if he leaves Microsoft.

- Jason Vallery previously obtained a competitive offer from Amazon for a product manager role on S3, and Juergen (last name unknown) advised him to get a competitive offer and then matched it with a large stock grant; Jason met Pete Emig through that Amazon process and later hired him.
