# IHDF executive session recap from Erika Smith (missed meeting)

**Date**: 2025-12-10
**With**: Erika Smith, Myself, Perla Delgado, Max (last name unknown), Shannon (last name unknown), Maureen (last name unknown), Jorin (last name unknown), Tracy (last name unknown)

## Summary

Erika Smith emailed a confidential recap of an IHDF executive session that Jason Vallery missed. Key points included risks of taking public stances due to tax-exempt status and donor/community impact, forming a broader fundraising committee, and an early-stage idea to explore acquiring a former church in Longmont with a small group assessing feasibility and reporting back to the board.


## Action Items


- [?] Ping Erika Smith for additional details on the IHDF executive session recap if more context is needed. @Myself 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Assess IHDF staff needs related to fundraising support requirements. @Perla Delgado #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Share the initial SWOT document draft for the potential acquisition of a former church building in Longmont (co-created with Erika Smith). @Perla Delgado #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Review initial feasibility of acquiring the former church building in Longmont and report findings back to the IHDF Board. @TBD #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Max (last name unknown) and Shannon (last name unknown) to add or correct details in the executive session recap thread. @TBD 🔽 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- IHDF will form a fundraising committee with a broader development scope than events and marketing (including volunteers and stewardship) and it may include non-board members and a budget.

- IHDF will discuss the impact of taking public stances in an executive session at the end of board meetings due to potential tax-exempt and donor/community risks.

- IHDF will have Maureen (last name unknown), Jorin (last name unknown), Tracy (last name unknown), and Perla Delgado assess initial feasibility of acquiring a former church in Longmont and report back to the IHDF Board.




## Key Information


- Erika Smith stated that taking public stances on some matters could create issues with IHDF tax-exempt status and could disenfranchise donors and the community, and recommended discussing the impact in an executive session at the end of board meetings.

- IHDF executive session participants agreed fundraising needs increased focus and that a fundraising committee broader than events and marketing (development, volunteers, stewardship) will be formed and may include non-board members and a budget.

- Perla Delgado needs to assess IHDF staff needs related to fundraising support; some members believe IHDF has the best development leader in place now.

- IHDF is exploring a very early-stage idea (about one day old as of 2025-12-10) to potentially acquire a former church building in Longmont that is for sale at a low price; the idea is not currently in any plan and is to be kept confidential.

- Perla Delgado will share the start of a SWOT document co-created with Erika Smith regarding the potential Longmont church acquisition.

- Maureen (last name unknown), Jorin (last name unknown), Tracy (last name unknown), and Perla Delgado were assigned to look at initial feasibility of the potential Longmont church acquisition and report back to the IHDF Board.
