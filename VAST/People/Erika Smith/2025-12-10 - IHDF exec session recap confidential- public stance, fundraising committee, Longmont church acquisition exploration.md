# IHDF exec session recap (confidential): public stance, fundraising committee, Longmont church acquisition exploration

**Date**: 2025-12-10
**Forum**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Erika Smith, Max (last name unknown), Shannon (last name unknown), Perla (last name unknown), Maureen (last name unknown), Jorin (last name unknown), Tracy (last name unknown)

## Summary

Erika Smith sent a confidential recap of an IHDF executive session that I missed. Key topics were risks of taking public stances (tax-exempt and donor/community impact), a plan to form a broader fundraising committee, and an early-stage exploration of acquiring a former church in Longmont with initial feasibility work assigned to specific individuals.


## Action Items


- [?] Follow up with Erika Smith to request any additional details from the IHDF exec session recap (as needed). @Myself 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Assess IHDF staff needs related to fundraising support and report findings to the appropriate IHDF leadership/board group. @Perla (last name unknown) #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Share the initial SWOT document for the potential acquisition of the former church in Longmont (co-created with Erika Smith). @Perla (last name unknown) #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Evaluate initial feasibility of acquiring the former church in Longmont and report back to the IHDF Board. @TBD #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Add/correct details in Erika Smith's recap email if needed. @TBD 🔽 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- IHDF executive session participants agreed to increase focus on fundraising and form a fundraising committee with a broader development scope than events and marketing.

- IHDF will explore initial feasibility of acquiring a former church in Longmont (early-stage, confidential) with a small group assigned to assess and report back to the Board.




## Key Information


- Erika Smith stated that taking public stances on some matters could create issues with tax-exempt status and could disenfranchise donors and the community, and recommended discussing the impact in an executive session at the end of board meetings.

- IHDF executive session participants agreed to focus more on fundraising and to form a fundraising committee beyond events and marketing, covering development, volunteers, and stewardship, potentially including non-board members and a budget.

- Perla (last name unknown) was asked to assess IHDF staff needs related to fundraising support; some members believe IHDF currently has the best development resources in place.

- A very early-stage idea was raised to explore acquiring a former church in Longmont that is for sale at a low price; it is not currently in IHDF plans and is to be kept confidential.

- Perla (last name unknown) will share the start of a SWOT document co-created with Erika Smith regarding the potential Longmont former church acquisition.

- Maureen (last name unknown), Jorin (last name unknown), Tracy (last name unknown), and Perla (last name unknown) were assigned to look at initial feasibility of the Longmont former church acquisition and report back to the IHDF Board.
