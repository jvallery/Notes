## Profile

**Role**: Program manager at VAST Data (Release planning)
**Location**: Tel Aviv (implied)
**Relationship**: Internal collaborator / meeting participant

**Background**:
- Referenced as a program manager to sync with.
- Identified as release manager (with Eyal).
- Jeff suggests the author should meet Noa; scheduling attempt occurred but she couldn't make it.

## Key Facts

- Eyal Traitel joined VAST in Dec 2024; Noa Cohen is a long-tenured VAST employee focusing on major releases while Eyal focuses on minor releases.
- Feature intake channels include leadership/architects, and SE requests filed in Salesforce tied to opportunities and triaged by Tomer Hagay’s team with bi-weekly reviews.
- Release managers run day-to-day execution for major and minor releases; Shelly Martin (Ops) and Liraz Ben Or (R&D) drive phase-gate documentation/process.
- vForce (Roy Sterman) and Dafna’s team manage service packs and hotfixes, including back/forward-porting and ensuring fixes go upstream to minors/majors.
- Minor releases are treated like full releases with regression and performance testing; weekly content/testing reviews.
- Planning is highly dynamic due to frequent urgent customer/field requests (example: Tesla), causing scope churn and parallel streams.
- 5.6 phase gates are underway with target GA in July next year.
- Historical cadence is roughly 2–3 major releases per year.
- Major multi-tenancy blocker: authentication providers limited to 8 and configured at host cluster rather than tenant-scoped; scaling and tenantizing is a large effort.
- Control plane (Polaris/Iceland) is more cloud-native; cluster layer is not yet operating in an agile/SaaS mode.

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Carl will move to ProServe under Rob rather than supporting customer-facing PM work.
- ✅ Set a monthly touchpoint with Brandon to align on cloud platform priorities.
- ✅ Customer requirement docs and FRDs will be authored and maintained in Confluence.
- ✅ Prioritize building a first-class cross-cloud platform and GTM versus ad hoc deal chasing.
- ✅ Carl will move to ProServe under Rob due to customer-facing risk.
- ✅ Morty will transition to the author’s team while maintaining Neo cloud feature ownership/commitments.
- ✅ The author owns defining cross-cloud product strategy and prioritization.
- ✅ Customer requirements and FRDs will be authored and maintained in Confluence (coordinated with A.L. and Tomer).
- ✅ Do not run an OpenAI alignment session until OpenAI engages.
- ✅ Primary focus is Microsoft while simultaneously investing in a Google TPU strategy.
