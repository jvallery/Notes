# Asaf Levy

## Key Facts

- Identified as the VAST chief architect involved in persistence architecture and QoS/governance design decisions for the multi-cloud object-tiering approach.

- Asaf Levy's team was cited as the architect function responsible for designing solutions for release features sourced by product management.

- Asaf Levy is the chief architect at VAST Data and is a key decision-maker for persistence architecture and QoS/governance design for VAST multi-cloud object-tiering.

- The QoS and governance model being defined uses identity-based quotas and prioritization across throughput, transactions per second (TPS), and capacity.

- Asaf Levy was assigned to schedule and run an internal working session with the Enscale technical team to refine the Microsoft MAI storyline and architecture.

- Asaf Levy was assigned to report out from the Friday Microsoft MAI session and align next steps.

- Jason Vallery planned to establish a weekly or monthly 1:1 cadence with Asaf Levy for coordination on cloud-related work.

- Asaf Levy performed field research that drove several platform and control fixes/features included in VAST Data 5.5.

- VAST is working with Asaf Levy and NVIDIA's Israel team on slides and animation for NVIDIA CES materials; a potential VAST press release may point to Asaf Levy's demo.

- Marianne Budnik stated VAST is working with Asaf Levy and NVIDIA team members in Israel, including Idan (last name unknown) and Ranen Carmel (NVIDIA Creative Director based in Tel Aviv), on slides and animation for CES content.

## Topics

- VAST object-tiering design for Blob/S3/GCS and metadata persistence options

- Consistency trade-offs for metadata persistence in multi-cloud object-tiering

- QoS and governance model using identity-based quotas and prioritization

- Benchmarking Premium Blob and S3 Express for metadata persistence versus block storage

## Key Decisions

- Proceed with an object-tiering design proposal for Azure Blob Storage, Amazon S3, and Google Cloud Storage (GCS) that explicitly documents metadata persistence options and consistency trade-offs.

- Use an identity-driven QoS/governance model with quotas and prioritization across throughput, TPS, and capacity.
