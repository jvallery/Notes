# 1:1 — Lior Genzel — 2025-09-16

> [!info] Purpose
> Build trust, surface and remove blockers, align on priorities, coach & grow.

## Summary

Intro call exploring roles for Jason at VAST. Lior outlined three potential homes (Jay’s model builders GTM, Lior’s hyperscalers/Azure GTM, or CTO Office). VAST signed Microsoft Lifter and is building a SaaS on Azure while pushing toward potential 1P or M&A. Jason shared deep Azure/OpenAI background, interest in customer-facing BD, and flagged egress/networking as a critical risk with a suggested path (ExpressRoute Direct Local). They agreed to start VAST’s interview process and likely focus Jason on the Azure business/strategic lane with a strong technical counterpart.

## Key facts learned

- Jason has ~13 years at Microsoft Azure Storage; led major AI storage engagements (e.g., OpenAI) and recently moved into an architect role.
- VAST signed Microsoft Lifter and is investing heavily in cloud GTM; scaling team from 1 to 10–15+.
- Potential org fits: Jay’s group (model builders/OpenAI/XAI), Lior’s hyperscalers GTM (Azure focus), or CTO Office (cross-cloud).
- VAST cloud GA plan as discussed: GCP (October), AWS MVP (December), Azure GA (February) with further Azure Lifter milestone around September next year.
- VAST positioning: beyond storage (big data platform, insights engine, vector DB), aiming for Azure 2.0 participation.
- Neoclouds: VAST widely adopted; NVIDIA DGX cloud blueprint favors VAST outside hyperscalers per discussion.
- Microsoft regrets ANF-type partnerships; preference to avoid single-source vendors and margin sharing.
- Network egress is a major risk; suggested mitigation via Azure ExpressRoute Direct Local; potential contacts: Frank Ray, Narayan.
- Target scale: build a $1B+/year business per hyperscaler over time.
- Comp discussion: Jason flexible on structure if equity upside is meaningful; prefers not to materially reduce quality of life.

## Outcomes

- Mutual interest to proceed; VAST will initiate formal interview process for Jason.
- Initial leaning to place Jason on the Azure business/BD lead track (owning strategic relationships) with a strong technical counterpart.
- Lior to explore Microsoft networking options (e.g., ExpressRoute Direct Local) and craft an egress/pricing program.
- Plan to set up next conversations with founders/leadership (e.g., Alon, Jay) as part of interviews.

## Decisions

- Proceed with interviews for Jason at VAST.
- Focus Jason initially on Azure GTM/business side rather than cross-cloud, with option to expand scope later.

- [x] Provide introductions or contact details for Azure Networking (e.g., Frank Ray, Narayan) when appropriate. @Jason Vallery ⏫ ✅ 2025-10-26

## Risks

- Cloud egress fees and cross-region/multi-cloud data movement costs could block adoption.
- Microsoft internal politics/slow execution and evolving OpenAI relationship may complicate Azure alignment.
- Compensation structure may be a hurdle versus current Microsoft cash comp.
- Role scope could become too broad early (risk of dilution) if not constrained to Azure first.
- Unclear current owner in Azure Networking; dependency on securing the right contacts and contracts.

## Open questions

- Final role placement: Lior’s Azure GTM vs. Jay’s model builders vs. CTO Office?
- Compensation structure and equity package for Jason.
- Exact Azure GA milestones and what lands in February vs. the Lifter-related milestone next September.
- Who is the definitive commercial owner in Azure Networking to drive ExpressRoute Direct Local and pricing agreements?
- Will Jason’s scope remain Azure-only initially or expand cross-cloud after initial build-out?

> Next meeting (if any): (none)

[00:00:00.04] zoom.us : >> Recording in progress. You I apologize for being late, I was listening to our product guy messing it all up so I apologize for that. I'm doing good. Okay, so... You were on a sales pitch and one of your product guys was sending the wrong message, is that the problem?

[00:01:48.50] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryYeah, I apologize for that. I'm doing good. Okay, so... You were on a sales pitch and one of your product guys was sending the wrong message,

[00:01:52.70] zoom.us : No, it was an internal call, so let's jump straight to it, right, so we finally decided to make the cloud a priority for Bust, and in the past few months with a lot of new hires and a lot of resources that are invested, I made the decision that it's time to start hiring for Go-To-Market, and I'm now in the process of ramping up a team of 10 to 15 people from just being me to 10 to 15 people, because the work is there. I was just trying to be Superman and do everything for everyone while we're trying to figure out if the product really has feasibility or feasibility to the market. Now I think that we are behind that point, so it's time to move forward. Because two of the cell specialists were already hired, this is an internal hire within VAST, and I exposed him to a call with a product guy, just to understand that he's just messing with their minds. Because he's talking about stuff that they don't even understand, and they're trying to listen, and you know, people lose confidence when they don't understand what's being discussed. So I had to jump into that call for a second and say, "Please, please, please, please, Please don't do what you're doing. Please don't talk about integration, which are fourth generation integration on cloud, but we're still on the first level of integration. It doesn't make any sense. You're not going to make the sales people more confident in what they do. They just don't understand what you're saying. Having said all that, so Glenn made the intro, right? Do tell me about yourself and kind of about. what you wish to do in life and so on and so forth, and this is an intro meeting where I'm open-minded to understand, you know, if and how we can partner.

[00:03:32.19] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason Vallery- Sounds good. Well, you know, about me. Spent the first 10 years of my career as a software developer. I'm technically passionate, geek at heart, if you will. But along that journey, you know, found that I also really... thrive working with customers and leading teams and, you know, looking at the bigger picture, and so I transitioned more into customer-facing roles, um, 13, 14 years ago, and you know, through that, I had a opportunity to work closely with Microsoft in my career and saw the writing on the wall that was Azure. the very early days and kind of jumped on board with Microsoft and Azure. I think I'm going on around 13 years at Microsoft these days and Azure from day one, and you know object storage became a part of what I found to be really just an interesting space to be in. I joined the Azure storage team and have worn many hats as we scaled the platform from our first one petabyte customer to what is now customers with tens of exabytes on the platform. You know surprisingly they're not our largest customer by exabytes but you know they are definitely the one that gets the attention in terms of we see platform gaps, needs to close product roadmap. Through that journey, I've worked with all of our Whale customers. Whale is a redefined term on an annual basis in terms of either revenue or exabytes or whatever, and a whole variety of different workloads come through. mature on the platform. I've owned within my scope over various points in the time in the team, capacity planning, feature roadmap, development on new priorities. I've owned sales engagements, I've owned go-to-market strategy, I've worked on pursuits with our sales teams. and our finance teams, margin profiles, it kind of, you know, in various ways, either directly or through my team, you know, owned the entirety of the business, and it's been a wild ride, you know, or we've gone into this territory now where it is just a machine though, that kind of operates on autopilot. You know, going from building that in its infancy. to what today exists, you know, we've kind of stalled out, you know, the ability for us to move the needle on things is no longer there, with this gigantic team, we have 1,600 people in Azure storage now, across PM and dev, and that doesn't include all the field and ancillary roles that support us.

[00:06:19.70] zoom.us : 1,600 people just for under my niche?

[00:06:22.74] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryI might actually be a little more than that now because they just re-orbed a few people so that might be a slightly stale number yet but Manisha is 1600 people which is just an insane thing to go to from where we were you know a decade ago. The other thing I would say like culturally at Microsoft we're very slow to execute. I wrote a technical strategy paper almost three years ago. now that outlined what I thought we needed to do to solve AI storage at scale. My first meeting with OpenAI was in 2018, and from 2018 until literally now, the amount of time I've spent with them has increased to the point where I was actually leading up until... I'll get to this in a second, but up until recently... I was full-time OpenAI and I had several folks working for me also just full-time OpenAI, just completely engaged with them. We also supported Microsoft AI and a few other AI labs that are sort of at smaller scale, but basically they have been my project for the last couple of years. The public reporting is clear on this, like the relationship with OpenAI very different than it was, you know, up until what I would say, the December of last year, it was an engineering to engineering relationship. Finance, legal, all of that stuff was pushed to the side and all decisions were made engineering to engineering between the two organizations. You know, the maturity of what OpenAI has accomplished is amazing and incredible, but ultimately. meant they grow up and they become a real big enterprise, and when I first met with them, they had 30 employees. Now they're pushing something like 5,000 people. They and Microsoft don't get along, lots of challenges, and it meant that over the last several months, since some of those contractual things happened, relationship is gone. You know, the folks at OpenAI are now tasked as a priority to become multi-cloud, and, you know, where it was, everything they built was built native to Azure. Blob storage APIs, all deeply entrenched in their entire code base. Like all the things I work with were said, "Meh, stop working with Microsoft. Go figure out how to abstract yourself away from Azure." And then all of the conversations pivoted for me. engineering to engineering to lawyer to lawyer and so that's interesting yeah

[00:08:43.01] zoom.us : But but they're still using Azure Blob even like a friend of mine is running the AI for OCI and he's saying that all of the OCI inferencing that they're doing is still connected to Azure Blob so it's not it's not that easy to

[00:08:55.22] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryDisconnect I guess. But there's some contractual reasons for that and probably some timeline reasons. for that. I mean, I was very involved with that project. I know all the ends of it. You know, I don't want to overshare, but yeah, we pulled, we pulled fiber directly from OCI and Abilene to our data centers in Dallas and we deployed a few exabytes for them there. You know, those project flight prior to some of the things that have happened more recently, and so how that evolves long-term, you know, it's, it's very unclear. But what I'll tell you is that it's also an inflection point for me in my career, like the energy that I was getting working on those projects, gone, and you know what it means for me in the future of my role within Azure Storage is changing. Like I decided at that sort of milestone to take a sabbatical, so I was off for the last three months. I was entitled based on my longevity at the company. I'm coming back right now, actually, I feel like a week and a half back from sabbatical, and Manisha's put me into an architect role, and it's an interesting role to kind of look at what we need to go deliver from a platform perspective, and so I alluded to this, like I wrote a strategy paper three years ago, what do we need to go build? And this is my frustration. We're so slow to execute on these things. If I was to look at that technical paper I wrote, I would say it's kind of what Vast went and built. You know, I have a ton of respect for Vast from a technical perspective, from a platform perspective. You know, I'm not blowing smoke here when I say, objectively, your tech stack is the best storage system outside of the hyperscalers, and certainly it is more mature than anything that Azure has in-house. You know, we we just have failed to execute on the vision that we laid out, and I think this is just Microsoft culture. We always are first to the vision, but last to execution, and that's where we sit as a staff, and so my choice in front of me is to kind of go back and be an architect for Manish on what we go build for AI storage. But I have a concern. I have two main concerns that I'm dealing with. with at this moment. One is that I thrive working with customers and it really isn't that anymore. I won't have those kinds of opportunities in this role, and second, I question our ability to execute. Like, you know, I don't think it's going to be a smooth journey to get there. We've struggled and we've looked at these things and we fail to make decisions and, you know, shipping features is not necessarily our story, and so, when I think about that, it puts me into this mindset of, I should explore what some of the others that are going fast are doing right now and see if there is a natural transition in my group.

[00:11:28.02] zoom.us : So, you know, I talk to Glenn a lot. So one second. So I've introduced some people from Microsoft. So first off, this sounds like the right decision. But there is a small challenge when you look at companies like Vaast, which is you got used to a very nice cash compensation, right? And Vaast is still a company that has a nice cash compensation relative to normal companies, but not related to somebody that's been doing what you were doing for the past 13 years with Azure, and there is that equity upside of the dream. Vast right now is $9.2 billion valuation based on two years ago, rumors in the market that the next round is $30 billion, and there won't be data breaks the day after, $100 billion. So how sensitive, and again, I love everything you're saying, and I want to figure out where to connect you at Vast the right way, but how sensitive are you to keeping the same cash compensation you have to pay?

[00:12:22.72] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryI mean, it's all, it's all a sum of, you know, what, what that forward looking opportunity

[00:12:29.92] zoom.us : is.

[00:12:30.92] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryAnd to your point, if you're a 9 billion valuation today and a 30 billion valuation tomorrow, that's a three X multiplier on stock on hire, right? So, you know, there's these there, I think that's explosive. Um, you know, I'm certainly not in the mindset that I'm looking to, you know, change my quality of life and downsize and cut, you know, my, my income opportunity, but I'm flexible in terms of what that shape takes, and, you know, I want to look at, um, you know, what's right both from a career perspective and a compensation perspective over the long term.

[00:13:00.64] zoom.us : So let me share with you kind of based on what you shared so far, there are two places that can be interesting for you, and one place is in my group, and the other place is in Jay's group, Jay is the VP, we both report up to the CRO, and maybe there is also a place in the engineering group or in the CTO office group, right, so let's open it even wider, you can be a part of the CTO office, which is the the team of specialists that you know can can touch projects from any vertical and do everything and if you feel that you want to be a part of the CTO office, I would be more than happy to introduce you to Alon, who is one of the founders in the CTO and probably the nicest person in the company, including me, and then Jay. Jay leads the model builders and the SAS company. companies out of the West Coast. Can I guess that you live in the West Coast?

[00:13:59.03] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason Vallery- I live in Colorado, so I'm an hour off Pacific, but--

[00:14:01.08] zoom.us : - Okay, so yeah, so let's call it West Coast for a second. So Jay leads OpenAI, right, and XAI, and all of these projects. So right now there is a campaign around OpenAI of how do we take what Microsoft is leaving behind make them a billion-dollar customer for us, right? So someone like you with your knowledge and your experience being a part of Jay's group, I think he might be looking for a technical leader to be the leader of all activities in his region, so that's a management position. I heard the rumor that the guy who's doing it today, who is not going anywhere. doesn't want to be a manager anymore, but that's a rumor. I need to check it out. But if you don't want to be a manager in his group, just being that model builder go-to person and technical expert and clearly understands the space, that's an interesting one. So that's one place. The second place is in my book where we just move. from nothing to something. So we signed LFTR. Last week we met with Manish, we met with Igal, we met with - the guy reports to Eric - the Specialized team, we met with Jason who is running the global partnerships, like we're connected to many people at Microsoft and with LFTR being signed and with us moving forward into getting our stuff on the market. marketplace at the beginning in the customer tenant and then as our own SaaS service, we're pushing hard to try and figure out a way to move forward and to become a 1P, right, first 5P service with Microsoft. So I've hired a sales specialist internally at Vaas, somebody who is just a salesperson, it's a she, and she's going to be the global sales specialist to help the Salesforce sale. I'm looking for two other people. One person is a strategic business development guy that will own the strategy with Microsoft, will own the relationship with Microsoft, and he will be do-or-die on getting us to different type of design programs and, you know, an all-star of the 1P, not only in storage. In storage, in big data, in everything. I'm a business guy that is responsible of how do we get from zero to a billion dollar business on Azure, okay, not in day one, but it's a big job like we're just starting, Cori for us is more than a billion dollar a year. So there is no reason that Azure will not be more than a billion dollar a year, right, and next to it, a technical expert. so that right but if technical partner that will work together so it's a group of three salesperson business development person technical person or the technical person needs to be the one that will oversee everything and will be put his fingers on anything that needs to happen there I can share those descriptions so you can potentially fit the BD guy or you can fit the the bd technical guy, and I am interviewing someone for the bd guy, someone for Microsoft. That is not as technical and knowledgeable as you are. So that's that's the second place, and the third place is probably probably the city office, which is different because then you can touch the cloud and you can touch the model builders and Like we're touching all customers because what's model builders and when XAI are saying that they want to get Well, they want to figure out how do they move into GCP then it comes to me then is the GCP team So we work with the model builder team to do that We are the experts of what goes to clouds and you are an Azure expert, right? That's an easy one So I would love you to join the Azure team if that's something that can pick your interests, and this is a story that is now being written. So we're moving from zero to a two and a three. We're moving from zero business to a signed lifter. We're moving from a huge pipeline of customers that wants to use us on Azure to really starting doing it, right? We have moved from five engineers that were building massive cloud to already now. 30 engineers. We have recently hired Yonsi, who was on the email introduction, who came with his entire team from NetApp. You probably know those guys. So, joining right now the Azure team, for you it will be Azure 2.0. You saw the Azure 1.0 before it was Azure and you joined and you rode that for 12 years. You can now have an opportunity to ride the Azure. 2.0 this time coming from Vaas. We have been talking to Julia who reports to Jay about what's really Azure 2.0 and the foundation. How do we become a part of that? Tons of technical stuff that we need to figure out. How do we integrate it? Because we are at the end, we're not just a storage company. Vaas started as a storage company, and yes, the foundations and the elements that we created is all storage, and the initial customers were all about blog storage file, but that is also a big data company So we've created a big data platform and it's also an insight engine like we have an engine of enabling people to run complete AI Pipelines and we are a vectorized database and we're doing so many other things, right? So, how do we take this and we connect to the Azure story? become a billion dollar business on Azure so I think that's more interesting than going after OpenAI and XAI because they will eventually lend them and likes and we already have some interesting variables from huge customers for us on Azure so there is MIT on the bone, MIT to work with, UK Met Office which is a huge Azure customer on specialized we go available from that team a month ago that the second deployment of 320 petabytes is going to be on what's fast is going to be on Azure so that's available from the Microsoft UK Met Office team. Wave since you are you probably know wave because it's one of the big names so wave just decided to to go into core with for the lack of GPUs on Azure cloud but they're going to core with the because BaaS is Core Wave, and they're already having data space in mind of, meaning once they move to Core Wave, they want to have BaaS on Azure, and then use our data space to move data to wherever GPUs are available. So they're going to be a big Azure BaaS customer as well, and many others. So what is your initial gut feeling here, or questions?

[00:20:15.59] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryLet me throw on some product strategy pieces around this. I have to be careful because obviously I still work for Azure, so you know there's a couple of hats I have to wear simultaneously in this conversation, but you know I'll candidly say to you I've heard that Microsoft openly say in meetings that I've been part of that one of the biggest regrets are mistakes we've made strategically over the last several years is the NetApp partnership, and the reason why, and this is me, the reason why is that Microsoft, from a strategic perspective at Azure, and I assume, I have friends at Amazon and Google too, and it sounds like it's kind of the same story, there's kind of two core tenets. You never want to be single source vendor tied, and two is that you don't want to have, um, you know, someone else taking your margin and you dealing with the operational complexities of deploying their stuff.

[00:21:12.37] zoom.us : Right.

[00:21:13.09] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryAnd so if you look at it, like ANF is the example of breaking both of those tenants, right? Because it was a moment of pressure, um, against the business where. we didn't have an NFS solution. Just candidly, like, you know, we're built on top of Windows Server. We didn't have NFS. All of our customers were beating down the door saying, "Where's the managed NFS offering?" And NetApps came along at the right time and said, "Hey, let's go sign this deal." And now here we are, I don't know what it is, four or five years later, since that deal was signed, and there's a lot of regret, frankly, because that should have been. Microsoft's revenue that should have been Microsoft's mark

[00:21:48.48] zoom.us : And the same on Databricks prior the similar similar conversation about Databricks him So what I'm saying is the following we are already committed of building our own SaaS service on Azure in our own tenants rights and And we're going to do it and we're going to do it a huge scale and we're going to take NetApp business away and we can take Databricks business away and we will take Managed Asset Business away and it will either end up with Microsoft doing a quick M&A and buying it because they won't do another A&F. I'm with you. I think Manish was clear about it. Like we had a meeting with him on Friday and then he had dinner with the CEO on Friday night. I think for Manish, 12 months of decision before bus becomes a 100 billion dollar company does he just buys the company and take it off the market because of the technology if he doesn't we will become a billion dollar business on Azure which is the goal like you know I would love them to make a decision to do a 1p and but we signed Lifter right and we're moving forward So, from our point of view, we will have the first party interface, and the Microsoft team that is being formed right now, that starts from three and will probably get to 30 by next year, that still needs to figure out how to just find the best swim lanes and the best relationship to accelerate the business. So, we are committed to building that SaaS service, to your question. There might be an M in it.

[00:23:17.26] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryLet me up-level it because I think the opportunity is beyond that. You know, as I look at the biggest challenge we face, and you alluded to this in the case of Wave going to CoreWeave, you know, even Microsoft AI is running on CoreWeave. Like the reality is that customers are getting GPUs wherever they can get them, and they're disaggregated sets of GPUs across the globe. OpenAI, they have GPUs in 30-something Azure regions, and one of their core asks to Microsoft is, I want more GPUs in fewer locations, and so from a product capability perspective, we have no global namespace, and so this is a clear differentiator that BaaS has, that you can have one namespace of data and you can expose that to...

[00:24:00.66] zoom.us : Different Azure regions, different clouds. We're doing the same program with GCP, AWS and internexed here with OCI. I did not think of hiring a technical partner yet to oversee all clouds with me. I might be wrong here, right? I'm kind of thinking out loud from what you're starting to say. to say. I thought that you know the best thing to do is to bring people in and to just focus them on their cloud and keep open communication between everyone. You might be a fit also for a level up, meaning I'm the business, I'm the go-to market business guy that leads everything, so I need to oversee the program across all clouds. You might be an interesting candidate to be the go-to-market person overseeing all clouds as well, right, and not just being in Azure. Maybe the initial step is building it with your two hands for Azure, and then we hire someone else to take the Azure piece. We are already, so Azure is, we signed Lifter, but just to be clear, we are GAing with our cloud for the first with GCP, so we are further away with GCP than we are with Azure because of customer demand. That will actually happen in October, next month. We will then GA in December with MVP, and I can explain what MVP is with AWS, and February is where we're going to GA with Azure, and then September of next year is when we're planning to GA with Azure based on the Lifter program, because that is… more time. So yeah, same as I'm building the business strategy across all clouds, I need to be able to build a technical strategy, and I'm a technical guy, but I'm not as technical as you are. So you joining might also be a position in my group to oversee all clouds, which I think might

[00:25:47.27] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason Vallerybe more interesting for you. I think it's an interesting idea, and I would extend it to be the Neo clouds. You know, they're getting a lot of business, CoreWeed, Crusoe, Lambda, Voltage Park.

[00:25:57.44] zoom.us : - This is 2 billion, so I'm going to quote Renen, not saying I don't believe him, but it's not my numbers because I didn't check it, just saying. When Renen talked about it with Manish, he dropped these numbers. 100 neoclouds are already using Vaas. Most of them are using Vaast as the first party, exclusive service. Meaning they've selected Vaast, just to be clear, same as you selected NetApp ANF, and they're building it and sending it to customers. Now this is already 2 billion plus business a year for Vaast, and I got the responsibility to lead zero business. That's how much you trust me. (laughs) public cloud, we do not sell on the public cloud today. So my task is to create a billion dollar a year for each and every one of those clouds, right, this is a I find the number, but same as we're doing a billion with call with, and I'm starting from zero, the new clouds is where 60% of the businesses today, years of relationship, and so it's not that you'd like any opportunity I touch on the big guys is related like when we've looked at what they want to go so we connected them to n scale and to call weave and we had three-way calls with call weave and n scale and cool so in others so it's all connected but there is a lining the same right now and the lining the same is that I'm responsible for the hyperscalers and there is no one to me that is responsible for the Neo clouds. The Neo clouds are sitting in regions and they all have different pricing, they all have different ways of deploying Vaas because these are first parties so they can decide to hide features, they can decide to build dedicated environments, they can decide to use our multi-tenancy features or just create you know whatever they want to do. We didn't force any of that, right? So again, that takes you now to the CTO office. Because to be successful at BASC, you need to have a mission that you wake up in the morning to do and you can show the achievement of that mission, and if you want to oversee everything, it's the CTO office. If you want to be in IT... hyperscalers like building the zero to billion right it's the hyperscalers if you want to be with the model builders because that's also existing business of 1 billion dollar plus right like XAI open AI wave is a part of it as a model builder like globally right so that's Jay's group and the only team that oversees everything is the CTO of his team

[00:28:32.22] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryI'm not necessarily pushing for something for myself, just more, you know, pushing on the strategy of where Vast ends up, because I think all of those cohorts, you'll likely see customers that end up, you know, getting capacity from some mix of hyperscalers and

[00:28:47.62] zoom.us : neoclassics. It's happening everywhere. Look, it's simple. Like, the reason why we developed globalization, you know, is because we have to, you know, namespace was to enable people to have access to data in a read-write fashion in a secondary data center that can be on-prem or on cloud. So from one cloud to the other, NeoCloud doesn't matter, where they can have immediate access to data based on a directory structure in the remote site, even if the files are not there. Metadata will move and then the data can move after, and that's being out there from version 5.1. We are at 5.3, almost 5.4. Then recently we announced or didn't announce SyncEngine, which is a software piece that enables you to start moving data for the first time outside of VaST back into VaST. This is mostly because of the public cloud object storage, which is price. Price is when you're not a 1P. you have no control on price on the cloud, and then you need to use the cheaper options, which is object storage. So, Sync Engine enables you to catalog all the data that is in VAS, or which was already there, right, globally, and also out of VAS, if you want to oversee, and use different movers, data movers, to move data in and out. So, now you can start, you call it archive, call it whatever, data tiering. This is the first step into auto-archive, auto-data-tiering with Vaas that wasn't there. So all of that is happening, and it's happening because of the relationship with those NeoClouds. The fact that we are already almost the standard de facto for NeoClouds is just making it so much simpler. 'Cause then for our customers, they don't need Sync Engine to move data to CoreViz because CoreViz is also Vaas, or to move to N-scale is also Vaas. of us or to move to cursor it goes also bust and that's the advantage we have now more than that it was announced or wasn't announced two weeks ago but NVIDIA had to think hard about their DGX clouds and how do they want it to be installed outside of the hyperscalers because the hyperscalers can do everything themselves and it's a managed service and it's a shift left strategy for NVIDIA but when this doing it with the NeoCloud and they're trying to go away from the hyperscalers because you guys at the end are competing against NVIDIA. At the end of the day, you know, we decide. So they sat down, your process, product team, and they made a decision that Vaas is the blueprint of NeoCloud moving forward outside of the hyperscalers. So now any new NeoCloud that wants to be a DGX cloud partner is also a Vaas customer. So global namespace becomes a very strong tool when you can move GCP to Azure, Azure to AWS, to NeoCloud, to on-prem. So the strategy is there. What I was referring to earlier is that I'm also looking like I'm trying to help you think about how do you want to approach this opportunity. I think Vaas is really focused on business, and it's not silent, but you need to know where you want to make it yours, in a way, and that's why we're structuring. Business strategy is clear. We're doing exactly what you're saying.

[00:31:43.98] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryHow are you overcoming network egress fees and the cloud techs? I mean, that feels like the biggest selling point for a solution like this.

[00:31:51.32] zoom.us : It's simple because we don't have any customers. so it's easy right now now if we put jokes aside what happened with wave is that you know wave came to Microsoft and they said we want to put 50 petabytes on core wave and Microsoft said it's five cents a gigabyte to regress the data out so we've said okay so we're moving everything out so they they waived the egress fee, no egress fee. Why no egress fee? Because because Microsoft is now building BaaS, which is what they're going to let go with, and now the plan is, you know, they will start there because Microsoft has a capacity issue, but they can always move their data back to Microsoft and consume GPUs. This is going to be at least the way I see it in the beginning for the big customers, big customers negotiation with hyperscalers and big customers like Wave or XAI or others can negotiate, and again, right now, most of the data flow I'm seeing on normal customers, and normal customers can be big, big names, like different banks and others, is burst into cloud. So most of the first customers we're going to have on cloud are not Wave, are these customers that created a billion-dollar era for us, so selling on-prem, and they have tens of petabytes to hundreds of petabytes for Vaas. So they use Vaas for all use cases on-prem. Vaas can compete against a backup target on-prem. Vaas can be cheaper than Azure Blob if you compare the on-prem to on-cloud, like price per gigabyte per month. We can do that on-prem. On-cloud, of course, there is no way to do that. So these customers… now looking for ways to burst into CPU, GPU resources, burst into building small, hundreds of terabytes, you know, high-performance clusters. That's our initial offering on cloud, and this is ingress, and ingress is really zero, right? People, you know, the cloud wants data to move into cloud. The egress, I think, at the beginning is going to be minimal, and if there is any egress, there is now a big project on AWS. with a financial customer, moving three petabytes from AWS to on-prem. So they're egressing, but they're leaving the cloud for that use case, and they're still keeping the cloud as a burst. It's an AI use case that is moving on-prem with 100 GPUs, and then they're still keeping the option of using the global namespace to burst into tens of GPUs when needed, when they need more power. than what the 100 GPUs can provide. So again, we are at the early stage, my friend. Like, I'm really open with you, same as you're open with me. This book is being written. We're at the first chapter of the book. I'm talking about the Vaston Cloud book, and how are we going to promote the use cases? And which verticals are we going to focus on? And how are we going to be-- strategic for Microsoft in the foundation model, in this J Azure 2.0 organization, they're building a new cloud, and now we're going to be strategic with Eagle Piglin to push him into building a hardware that is a better fit for our software for our 1P service, or sorry, for our SaaS service. All of that is still being written. All of that are still stuff that we're working on, right? We're not there yet. That's why I'm hiring the strategic people. I'm trying to hire strategic people to lead that effort because I Can't do it myself. That's it. We are well past the point of one person

[00:35:03.42] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryWell, look, I'm excited about the idea of working with you on building this. I think I'll leave I'll give you a tip Okay, you need to work with our networking team. You need to think about how you're going to solve this egress problem, we have precedence inside of the organization around partnering with companies that move data, like CDN providers that avoid these kinds of charges, because I think the inevitable scenario is you're going to have a customer who's generating data in one region that needs to process it in another region. This is the canonical opening, and as that becomes multi-cloud, you're going to need to real-time move data between clouds, between hyperscalers and neoclouds and on-prem, and that data movement mesh is just going to become the biggest challenge you'll face with your vision, and solving that early with the right networking partnerships. is, I think, the key to success for what you want to go do, and I'd love to go part of it. It's fun building things.

[00:36:07.19] zoom.us : So to the lady with the red dress, I already wrote myself a note. I'm going to follow up.INAUDIBLE immediately to understand how do we start building a program for the network team to be aware of what we do and to build a program that suggested to customers so they know exactly what to expect. Thank you for the for the tip.

[00:36:28.10] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryYou got to get pricing and contracts from Microsoft in place before they realize what a risk it is to their business. Because it is Microsoft's long-term risk. Like to be clear, that's the that's the big hammer they have to protect customers' egress. out of Azure and it's the same on the other clouds.

[00:36:48.11] zoom.us : But when I build my own SaaS service, then I have that contract, but if I don't build a SaaS service, then it's the customer, right? So the data will be... So right now, the first offering is a managed cluster in the customer tenant.

[00:37:01.69] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryRight now, there's a service that nobody really ever buys called Express Route Direct Local. But who uses it? I'll tell you, the key customers that buy it are the CDN providers in the world. The Akamai, Fastly, CloudSport.

[00:37:18.15] zoom.us : Express? What's the name of the service again? Express?

[00:37:21.27] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryExpressRouteDirectLocal. What it enables you to do as a partner with Microsoft is get a 100 gigabit circuit and a specific IP address. point where we interconnect with the public internet and you can move as much data through that hundred gigabit circuit as you want for a fixed monthly price and it can come out of a customer's tenant or your tenant. Okay so

[00:37:44.10] zoom.us : I if I sell a cluster that logos into a customer tenant I can also use that service and proactively promote a business. a solution for the customer because it can use it to egress fee. Okay, I like that. Who is the person on the networking team that I want to get in front of? Who is the lead person there?

[00:38:04.37] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryThey just had a big rework. So I don't know, their, their, their, their Manish equivalent just got kind of pushed aside and retired. So I don't know who's stepping up at the moment. I can make I'll figure out like, I know, like I, I know a bunch of folks over there. I just didn't know who's sitting in the commercial seat right now. It's probably a guy named Frank Ray would be my guess. Um, Narayan is the guy who kind of sits over all of it. Um, and has picked up for Dave when he got pushed out. But I think I would start with Frank Ray to see what his take is.

[00:38:38.36] zoom.us : Okay, where do you so we spoke something for you to think about and it sounds like you are intrigued, right? I would love to see to see you join the Microsoft because you are 12 years Microsoft and because Microsoft right now is where we have most of the bets on the strategic relationships not get to the sense we have strategic relationship with GCP. Let's say if Microsoft is saying GCP is 5, AWS is 0. Again, nothing is black and white. So right now the biggest impact can happen with Azure and then again I would love to see you as either the business or the technical person, maybe better as the person because then you have another brain to work with, assuming it's the right compensation one way or the other, and then after six months, if that's become boring and we get to a place that we understood what we're doing, then take a step up and do it for all the other clouds. So hire people that will be working for you and and be responsible for building the same type of program with all the people. clouds, and I think people as good as you for each and every one of the clouds, I would love to see that. So if something to think about, I want you to talk to a few other people once you say you want to talk to them, some of the founders, and let's let's move forward, tell me when you want to move forward and talk with other people.

[00:40:04.56] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryLet's go. I mean, I'm interested. Okay. I mean, transparently, I am actually talking to a couple of the Neo clouds, they've got roles. I mean, I don't know what's happening out there, but I can imagine they're trying to figure out their storage strategies and how it relates with Vast in the future. So this is the transition moment for me. I'm ready to go and objectively, no blowing smoke, I do actually really think that Vast is best positioned to capitalize on the next wave. But being part of that sounds fun. I'll tell you, I bring-- obviously, I know we're a Microsoft buried all the bodies, and I think it'd be fun to kind of work on the other side over there and see what we can go do.

[00:40:43.51] zoom.us : Yeah, I'm seeing you more as-- I just don't-- I'm afraid of trying to put somebody in a position where he has so much to do when he starts. where then nothing will get to the closer, where I know that Azure is going to be so much work, and I just want to have someone like, with your skillset of just go all in and just figure out everything with the team and just get us to a place where, wow, we're starting to do business there and we have the right program, and then if it's not enough to build a billion dollar business out of nothing, and do it with the other clouds as well. But the others I'm hiring for the teams are really, I'm hiring them to stay, I'm hiring them as people that are going to be a part of that program and starting from a team of three to a team of 30. Like NetApp is 300 people on Azure, this is the first three people. All right, so it's an interesting position. It's like starting a new company, vast on Azure, it's not the same product, it's a different approach, they can go. to market, different things to consider. So it's an interesting project.

[00:41:43.05] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason Vallery- Well, look, I'm flexible how you deploy me. I have strong technical background, a lot of business skills. I love and thrive working with kind of customers and doing BD kind of work as well. So, you know, I can wear all those hats, and I think in this early phase of what you're trying to accomplish, it's appropriate that somebody can come in and help you and wear all those hats. So we can figure that out.

[00:42:03.30] zoom.us : OK. I'm going to set you up with the next conversation, and I'm going to ask HR to start an official process with you so you will be in the system, and I will define the right interviews for you to talk to the right people. So you can also ask and share opinions, and yeah, you can potentially do both, right? You can potentially do both. But if I need to ask you-- if you're not doing both and I can put someone next to you to help you day one because we want to we don't want to bet on resources would you prefer to have someone extremely technical next to you or you prefer to have someone who is busy development next to you let's say they're both professionals which side would you prefer to have your help? I think it depends on how that sort of

[00:42:44.00] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryEvolves from a strategy and product perspective. aligned to what you want to get out of Azure? I mean, personally, I thrive in the mix of those two worlds, right, because what I do is I take the requirements and the business strategy and turn them into technical designs and proposals, and so I kind of straddle both of those fences in my current role, and I think that's appropriate here. Now, what do I need to support? me I don't have the real sense on where we go next so I think that's you need I'll give an example

[00:43:14.82] zoom.us : Like you need to build a strategic relationship and trust relationship with the CVPs right and you need to be able to sit down to to get in front of Jay and Julie an organization and to figure out the swim lane with us in that program. like business wise, right? You need to also be able to communicate, you know, with our sales force and the Azure sales force on stage, not on stage, to be able to really promote the solution and use cases to the market. So it's clear to me that you can touch everything. But the question is, do you want to be the one owning the strategic relationship Figlin and Manish and others? Or do you want to be the one that will be owning the design, what we're going to do and the actual stuff? So a business guy, sometimes it's just somebody who can just outdo everyone, get everybody and just move the shit to the right direction. At the end of the day, the strong technical guy is the one who is dictating the value of what's created, right? So I'm just asking you with full open. like something to think about. If I want you, who do I put next to you? Something that will help you with the business side and the relationships and the strategy of how to approach Microsoft and how to approach fabrics and what type of relationship and how do we build, you know, the right political environment or someone that will come and will be a bit and bite expert that can go dream. into the details of what you're doing with different, you know, AI projects and help you on that level. You will get help from other people in the company but it's

[00:44:45.53] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryNot the same. I got you. In this world, I'm definitely on the business side with you. You know, I thrive as a communicator, working with others, obviously these are relationships that I already have in many cases, that's where I would excel

[00:44:59.57] zoom.us : For you. you gave me the answer. So you are now interviewing against another candidate that is also a good guy from Microsoft. I like you a lot. So I put chips on you now. You're a good guy. I'm going to start your interview process. Very clear. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Jason. Bye-bye. (clicking)AUDIOBLANK You
