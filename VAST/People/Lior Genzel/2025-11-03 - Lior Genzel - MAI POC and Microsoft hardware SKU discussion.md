# Lior Genzel - MAI POC and Microsoft hardware SKU discussion

**Date**: 2025-11-03
**With**: Jason Vallery, Lior Genzel

## Summary

Notes indicate a 1:1 style discussion with Lior Genzel about a Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) proof of concept and implications of a Microsoft-provided hardware SKU. The conversation also touched on broader Voice of Customer (VoC) inputs and a Google-related thread, but details were not captured in the transcript.

## Action Items

- [?] Clarify what the Microsoft-provided hardware SKU refers to (SKU name, configuration, intended use, and whether it is required for the MAI POC). @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Define the MAI POC scope (success criteria, environment, timeline assumptions, and VAST deliverables) and document it for internal alignment. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Capture and summarize the specific Voice of Customer (VoC) items that motivated the MAI POC and hardware SKU discussion, including which customers and what pain points. @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Identify what the Google mention referred to (GCP MVP, Google Marketplace offers, Google Distributed Cloud RFP, or another Google initiative) and whether it impacts MAI POC planning. @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Clarify what the Microsoft-provided hardware SKU is (exact SKU name, configuration, and intended deployment model) and how it impacts VAST Data positioning for MAI. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Define the MAI POC: success criteria, architecture assumptions, required VAST components, and who owns execution on the Microsoft side. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Collect and summarize broader Voice of Customer (VoC) inputs related to MAI and hardware SKU expectations, and map them to VAST product gaps or opportunities. @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Assess whether any learnings from the MAI hardware SKU and POC should inform VAST's Google Cloud Platform (GCP) integration or Google partnership messaging. @Myself #task #proposed #auto
