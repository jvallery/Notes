## Key Decisions

- Proceed with initiating VAST Data's formal interview process for Jason Vallery.

- Initial bias to focus Jason Vallery on Azure go-to-market and strategic relationship ownership, paired with a strong technical counterpart, with potential to expand scope later.

- Prioritize building a Microsoft MAI stakeholder map (reporting lines and roles for Kushal, Vipin, and their management chain) to target influence effectively amid MAI organizational changes.

- Do not include non-public Microsoft Azure Blob on HDD/Flash performance or cost figures in externally shared decks or materials, especially when third parties (example: N-scale) could receive them.

- For the MAI engagement, prioritize immediate functional testing access via an existing VAST environment and pursue hardware-based testing using pre-certified hardware, since VM support is not available until December 2025 and will initially be limited.
