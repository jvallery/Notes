## Profile

**Relationship**: Primary owner of the listed follow-ups; collaborator on pipeline and partner coordination.

**Background**:
- Point person driving cloud/provider pipeline synthesis, performance/pricing/TCO discussions, and introductions across Google/Microsoft and customer solution teams.
- Referenced as the entity for this note; no additional background provided in the content.

## Open Tasks

- [ ] Clarify what the Microsoft hardware SKU implies/means for the workstream.
- [ ] Follow up on the POC with MAI (scope/status/next steps).
- [ ] Define/expand VoC approach more broadly (what is needed, how it will be used).
- [ ] Determine relevance/next steps regarding Google in this context.

## Key Facts

- John runs alliances/partnerships and is the go-to for AMD/NVIDIA and channel (non-cloud).
- Sagi leads pipelines/serverless and needs alignment on cloud GTM and packaging.
- Morty owns Neo cloud feature requirements and must maintain that coverage while supporting the author’s area.
- Rob’s customer success org is primarily support and systems engineering today.
- Confluence is the source of record for FRDs/customer requirements for engineering consumption.
- Google RFP may be TPU-oriented; ensure scope is not block-I/O latency sensitive where NetApp excels.
- Jeff will be in Orlando Tue–Thu next week for sales strategy; SE engagement is high value.
- Risk: ambiguity between author scope and Lior’s could cause ownership gaps and misaligned priorities.
- Jason’s mandate is to own multi-cloud strategy end-to-end and translate deal flow into requirements, Confluence docs, and focused cloud plays (Azure/AWS/GCP/Oracle plus Foundry/Bedrock/Vertex).
- Near-term proof points include building the 'dagger' Azure slide, establishing a win/loss cadence, and embedding with SEs during/after Tech Summit.

## Topics

Org landscape and role mapping, Cross-cloud platform strategy (including Neo clouds), Cloud GTM and packaging (Foundry/Bedrock/Vertex), Alliances and control-plane partnerships, In-flight deal cataloging by product requirements, Google RFP preparation (TPU), Microsoft competitive positioning vs Azure Storage, Customer requirements/FRDs documentation in Confluence, SE engagement and field exposure (Orlando Tech Summit), PM capacity and operating cadence, Win/loss analysis cadence, Onboarding/tooling friction (calendars/notifications), Org chart and key players across sales/engineering/product, Product management structure and process, Multi-cloud strategy and cloud plays (Azure/AWS/GCP/Oracle)

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Carl will move to ProServe under Rob rather than supporting customer-facing PM work.
- ✅ Set a monthly touchpoint with Brandon to align on cloud platform priorities.
- ✅ Customer requirement docs and FRDs will be authored and maintained in Confluence.
- ✅ Focus on building a first-class cross-cloud platform and GTM versus ad hoc deal chasing.
- ✅ China should be approached as a sales outpost rather than a location for significant capital investment or operational infrastructure.
- ✅ Carl will move to ProServe under Rob due to limitations in customer-facing roles.
