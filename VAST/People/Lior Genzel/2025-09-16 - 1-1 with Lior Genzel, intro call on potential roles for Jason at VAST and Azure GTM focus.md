# 1:1 with Lior Genzel, intro call on potential roles for Jason at VAST and Azure GTM focus

**Date**: 2025-09-16

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Lior Genzel held an intro call about Jason potentially joining VAST Data, with Lior describing a major cloud GTM hiring ramp and several possible org homes. Jason shared his Azure Storage and OpenAI engagement background and highlighted cloud egress and networking as a key adoption risk, with ExpressRoute Direct Local as a mitigation path; both agreed to proceed into a formal interview loop and initially bias toward an Azure GTM and strategic relationships role paired with a strong technical counterpart.

- Proceed with initiating VAST Data's formal interview process for Jason Vallery.

- Initial bias to focus Jason Vallery on Azure go-to-market and strategic relationship ownership, paired with a strong technical counterpart, with potential to expand scope later.

- Initial bias to focus Jason Vallery on Azure go-to-market and strategic relationship leadership, paired with a strong technical counterpart, rather than starting with a broad cross-cloud scope.

## Key Information

- Lior Genzel stated VAST Data recently made cloud a top priority and is ramping cloud go-to-market headcount from a single person (Lior) to a team of roughly 10 to 15 people due to increased workload and confidence in product-market feasibility.

- Lior Genzel described a sales enablement issue where a VAST Data product team member discussed advanced cloud integrations beyond current maturity, which reduced sales confidence because the content was not understandable to the sales specialists.

- Jason Vallery said he spent about the first 10 years of his career as a software developer and transitioned into customer-facing roles about 13 to 14 years ago.

- Jason Vallery said he has been at Microsoft working on Azure since the early days and has approximately 13 years at Microsoft, primarily in Azure Storage and object storage.

- Jason Vallery said Azure Storage scaled from its first 1 PB customer to customers with tens of exabytes, and he has held responsibilities spanning capacity planning, feature roadmap, development priorities, sales engagements, go-to-market strategy, and margin profile work with finance.

- Jason Vallery estimated Azure Storage has roughly 1,600 people across product management and engineering (excluding field and ancillary roles), noting the number may be slightly higher due to recent org changes.

- Jason Vallery stated Microsoft culture is slow to execute and that he wrote a technical strategy paper about three years prior outlining how to solve AI storage at scale.

- Jason Vallery said his first meeting with OpenAI was in 2018 and that until recently he was effectively full-time on the OpenAI engagement with several people working for him also full-time on OpenAI, while also supporting Microsoft AI and other smaller AI labs.

- Jason Vallery said the Microsoft and OpenAI relationship shifted from engineering-to-engineering decision making to lawyer-to-lawyer interactions after contractual changes, and that OpenAI is prioritizing becoming multi-cloud and abstracting away from Azure-native dependencies such as Azure Blob Storage APIs.

- Glenn Lockwood made the introduction between Jason Vallery and Lior Genzel for this exploratory conversation about partnering and potential roles at VAST Data.
