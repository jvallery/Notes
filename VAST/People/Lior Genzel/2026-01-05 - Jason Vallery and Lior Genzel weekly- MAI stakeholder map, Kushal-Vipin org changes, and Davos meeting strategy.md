# Jason Vallery and Lior Genzel weekly: MAI stakeholder map, Kushal/Vipin org changes, and Davos meeting strategy

**Date**: 2026-01-05
**With**: Lior Genzel, Jason Vallery

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Lior Genzel aligned on the need to map Microsoft MAI stakeholders and reporting lines due to org churn affecting Kushal and Vipin. They discussed Microsoft’s “eat our own dog food” platform thesis and how it shapes MAI leadership incentives versus operator pain with Azure Storage. Lior shared that Leah is attempting to secure Davos meetings for Renan with Satya Nadella and Jason Taylor, with the goal of using any acceptance to trigger a follow-on meeting with Scott to accelerate engineering collaboration discussions.


## Action Items


- [?] Set up an introductory call between Kushal (Microsoft MAI) and Alon Horev, and ask Kushal to invite additional Microsoft stakeholders who would value an introduction to VAST Data. @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-12 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule a separate short call with Kushal (Microsoft MAI) to ask non-technical logistical and process questions (not related to technology). @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-12 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Obtain and review the Microsoft MAI reporting chain for the five current MAI contacts (who reports to whom, roles, and flow up the org) from Leah, and use it to build a stakeholder influence map. @Myself 📅 2026-01-12 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm whether Mustafa (Microsoft MAI leader) is attending the Davos event in mid-January and whether a Renan-Mustafa meeting can be arranged in January as Kushal previously suggested. @Myself 📅 2026-01-12 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Follow up with Leah on the status of Davos meeting approvals for Renan with Satya Nadella and Jason Taylor, and align on a pre-brief narrative and supporting attendees if a Scott meeting is triggered. @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-09 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- VAST will create a Microsoft MAI stakeholder map, including reporting lines for current contacts (Kushal, Vipin, and others) to determine who to influence given MAI org churn.

- Lior Genzel will pursue an introductory call between Kushal and Alon Horev, with Kushal inviting additional relevant Microsoft stakeholders.




## Key Information


- Lior Genzel was back in Tel Aviv as of Monday, 2026-01-05.

- Lior Genzel has been exchanging messages with Kushal (Microsoft MAI contact) and proposed setting an introductory call between Kushal and Alon Horev, asking Kushal to invite additional Microsoft stakeholders who would value an introduction to VAST Data.

- Jason Vallery believes there is confusion and churn in Microsoft MAI organizational structure, including new managers and recent hires, and that VAST needs a stakeholder map to know who to influence.

- Jason Vallery stated that historically Kushal and Vipin were in different parts of Microsoft MAI, with Vipin aligned to infrastructure operations and Kushal aligned to business and longer-term research requirements, and they historically had different managers.

- Lior Genzel asked Leah (VAST contact) to provide the reporting chain for five current Microsoft MAI contacts, including who reports to whom and what each person does, and also asked for any Israel-based connections who understand MAI well.

- Jason Vallery described a Microsoft cultural thesis that Microsoft is a platform company that “eats its own dog food,” meaning internal teams are pressured to build on Azure so Azure improves, which can conflict with MAI operators who want non-Azure solutions that work immediately.

- Jason Vallery recalled that at a Supercomputing conference meeting with Anson (unknown last name), Anson described Project Apollo’s ethos as “go fast,” use and contribute to open source, and hire people with public open source experience, which Jason said differs from typical Microsoft team culture he experienced.

- Lior Genzel stated that Leah is attempting to schedule Davos meetings in mid-January for Renan with Satya Nadella and Jason Taylor, but there was no approval yet as of 2026-01-05.

- Lior Genzel stated that a meeting with Jason Taylor is less strategically valuable because Jason Taylor wants VAST on Azure Marketplace, and Lior believes pushing Marketplace too early could backfire.

- Jason Vallery said that before Renan’s New Jersey meeting with Kushal, Jason attempted to secure a data center tour for Renan and in the process “pissed off Sagar” (unknown last name) while pulling favors to make it happen.

- Jason Vallery said Kushal told him that Mustafa’s chief of staff, Majid, would attend the data center tour, and Kushal suggested that if the goal is a Renan-Mustafa meeting, that could be arranged in January.

- Jason Vallery said that in the actual Renan meeting, Majid did not show up and the attendees were Kushal and a couple of Kushal’s direct reports, including someone Jason heard as “Boomi” and another person possibly named Rohit (uncertain).
