## Key Information


- Lior Genzel is ramping VAST Data's cloud go-to-market team from a single-person function (himself) to a team of 10 to 15 people due to increased cloud GTM workload and investment.

- Jason Vallery has approximately 13 years at Microsoft working on Azure from early days, including roles spanning capacity planning, feature roadmap, development priorities, sales engagements, and go-to-market strategy for Azure Storage.

- Jason Vallery led deep engagement with OpenAI starting from an initial meeting in 2018 and was recently full-time focused on OpenAI with multiple team members also dedicated full-time to OpenAI work.

- Jason Vallery believes Microsoft culture executes slowly and stated he wrote an AI storage-at-scale technical strategy paper about three years prior to this meeting.

- Jason Vallery stated the Microsoft and OpenAI relationship shifted from engineering-to-engineering decision making to lawyer-to-lawyer engagement after contractual changes, and OpenAI is prioritizing becoming multi-cloud.

- Lior Genzel described an internal VAST Data issue where a product team member was discussing advanced cloud integrations beyond current maturity, which reduced sales confidence due to misaligned messaging.

- Glenn Lockwood made the introduction between Jason Vallery and Lior Genzel for this role exploration conversation.
