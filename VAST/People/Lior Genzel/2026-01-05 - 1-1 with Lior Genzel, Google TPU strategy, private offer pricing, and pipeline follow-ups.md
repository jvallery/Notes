# 1:1 with Lior Genzel, Google TPU strategy, private offer pricing, and pipeline follow-ups

**Date**: 2026-01-05
**With**: Jason Vallery, Lior Genzel

## Summary

Discussion focused on Google TPU strategy outside GCP, private offer and pricing model considerations, and near-term event alignment (Ignite, GTC-DC). Lior Genzel owned several follow-ups to connect Jason Vallery with Microsoft, UK Met, Zoom, and GCP performance stakeholders and to synthesize multi-cloud pipeline requirements.

## Action Items

- [?] Build a synthesized pipeline and requirements view for Oracle, Microsoft, AWS, and Google, and map VAST product fit. @Lior Genzel 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule a call with the Microsoft Managed Lustre performance lead to review implementation details, performance results, and pricing/TCO with Jason Vallery. @Lior Genzel 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Connect Jason Vallery with the UK Met sales engineering or solution team to capture workload characteristics, I/O patterns, and performance expectations. @Lior Genzel 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Obtain Zoom’s Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) comparison basis (dense E5 VMs vs NVMe plus object storage mix) and drive a decision on whether to pursue OCI parity work or a POC. @Lior Genzel 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Share the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) performance Excel and introduce Jason Vallery to the performance lead and the product marketing owner responsible for the field calculator. @Lior Genzel 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Reconnect Product Marketing with Jason Vallery and Jonsi Stephenson and include Polaris and marketplace content requirements in the engagement. @Lior Genzel 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Build a synthesized pipeline and requirements view for Oracle, Microsoft, AWS, and Google, and map VAST product fit across those clouds. @Lior Genzel 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Connect Jason Vallery with the UK Met Office SE and solution team to capture workload characteristics, I/O patterns, and performance expectations. @Lior Genzel 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Obtain Zoom’s Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) comparison basis, specifically whether the comparison used dense E5 VMs versus an NVMe plus object storage mix, then decide whether to pursue OCI parity work or a proof of concept (POC). @Lior Genzel 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Share the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) performance Excel and introduce Jason Vallery to the performance lead and the product marketing owner responsible for the field performance calculator. @Lior Genzel 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Reconnect Product Marketing with Jason Vallery and Jonsi Stephenson and include Polaris and marketplace content requirements in the collaboration scope. @Lior Genzel 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

## Decisions

- Decide whether to pursue Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) parity work or a proof of concept (POC) after obtaining Zoom’s OCI comparison basis (dense E5 VMs vs NVMe plus object storage mix).

## Key Information

- Google's TPU strategy outside of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) was expected to be disclosed on an approximately two-week timeline, and required alignment with Google contacts Nirav and Michelle plus preparation meetings (example: GTC-DC).

- Sales pipeline accounts discussed included Zoom, UK Met, and NBCU, with follow-ups focused on workload requirements, I/O patterns, and performance expectations.
