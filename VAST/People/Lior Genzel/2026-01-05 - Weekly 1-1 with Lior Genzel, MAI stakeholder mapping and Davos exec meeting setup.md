# Weekly 1:1 with Lior Genzel, MAI stakeholder mapping and Davos exec meeting setup

**Date**: 2026-01-05
**With**: Jason Vallery, Lior Genzel, Alon Horev, Kushal, Vipin, Leah, Jack Kabat, Anson (Qi), Renan, Satya Nadella, Jason Taylor, Scott, Mustafa, Manish Sah, Majid, Sagar, Rohit, Boomi

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Lior Genzel aligned on the need to map Microsoft MAI stakeholders and reporting lines (Kushal, Vipin, and their management chain) to influence the right decision makers amid MAI org churn. Lior is working with Leah to obtain an MAI org flow chart and is pushing to set an intro call between Kushal and Alon Horev. They also discussed potential Davos meetings for Renan with Satya Nadella and Jason Taylor as a path to trigger a follow-on meeting with Scott, with risk noted that marketplace-focused discussions could backfire if positioned poorly.

## Action Items

- [?] Set up an introductory call between Kushal (Microsoft MAI) and Alon Horev, and ask Kushal to invite additional Microsoft stakeholders who would value an introduction to VAST Data. @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-12 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule a separate short call with Kushal (Microsoft MAI) to ask non-technical logistical and process questions (not related to technology). @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-12 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Obtain and review the Microsoft MAI reporting chain for the five current MAI contacts (who reports to whom, roles, and flow up the org) from Leah, and use it to build a stakeholder influence map. @Myself 📅 2026-01-12 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm whether Mustafa (Microsoft MAI leader) is attending the Davos event in mid-January and whether a Renan-Mustafa meeting can be arranged in January as Kushal previously suggested. @Myself 📅 2026-01-12 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Follow up with Leah on the status of Davos meeting approvals for Renan with Satya Nadella and Jason Taylor, and align on a pre-brief narrative and supporting attendees if a Scott meeting is triggered. @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-09 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Set an introductory call between Kushal (Microsoft MAI) and Alon Horev so Kushal can meet VAST Data leadership and invite additional MAI stakeholders for a first introduction to VAST Data. @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-12 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Obtain and review the Microsoft MAI reporting chain for key contacts (including Kushal and Vipin) to build a stakeholder map of who reports to whom and who to influence for MAI storage decisions. @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-12 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule a quick call with Kushal to ask non-technical logistical and process questions related to Microsoft MAI engagement (not technology-specific). @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-12 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Verify the current Microsoft MAI org structure and identify the correct managers for Kushal and Vipin (including confirming who 'Young Chow' is and whether Kushal and Vipin now share a manager). @Myself 📅 2026-01-12 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Track approval status for Davos meeting requests for Renan with Satya Nadella and Jason Taylor, and align internal positioning to avoid a marketplace-first discussion that could backfire. @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-10 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Pursue a January meeting between Renan and Mustafa by following up with Kushal on the opening he offered after the New Jersey meeting. @Myself 📅 2026-01-17 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

## Decisions

- VAST will create a Microsoft MAI stakeholder map, including reporting lines for current contacts (Kushal, Vipin, and others) to determine who to influence given MAI org churn.

- Lior Genzel will pursue an introductory call between Kushal and Alon Horev, with Kushal inviting additional relevant Microsoft stakeholders.

- Prioritize building a Microsoft MAI stakeholder map (reporting lines and roles for Kushal, Vipin, and their management chain) to target influence effectively amid MAI organizational changes.

## Key Information

- Lior Genzel was back in Tel Aviv as of Monday, 2026-01-05.

- Lior Genzel has been exchanging messages with Kushal (Microsoft MAI contact) and proposed setting an introductory call between Kushal and Alon Horev, asking Kushal to invite additional Microsoft stakeholders who would value an introduction to VAST Data.

- Jason Vallery believes there is confusion and churn in Microsoft MAI organizational structure, including new managers and recent hires, and that VAST needs a stakeholder map to know who to influence.

- Jason Vallery stated that historically Kushal and Vipin were in different parts of Microsoft MAI, with Vipin aligned to infrastructure operations and Kushal aligned to business and longer-term research requirements, and they historically had different managers.

- Lior Genzel asked Leah (VAST contact) to provide the reporting chain for five current Microsoft MAI contacts, including who reports to whom and what each person does, and also asked for any Israel-based connections who understand MAI well.

- Jason Vallery described a Microsoft cultural thesis that Microsoft is a platform company that “eats its own dog food,” meaning internal teams are pressured to build on Azure so Azure improves, which can conflict with MAI operators who want non-Azure solutions that work immediately.

- Jason Vallery recalled that at a Supercomputing conference meeting with Anson (unknown last name), Anson described Project Apollo’s ethos as “go fast,” use and contribute to open source, and hire people with public open source experience, which Jason said differs from typical Microsoft team culture he experienced.

- Lior Genzel stated that Leah is attempting to schedule Davos meetings in mid-January for Renan with Satya Nadella and Jason Taylor, but there was no approval yet as of 2026-01-05.

- Lior Genzel stated that a meeting with Jason Taylor is less strategically valuable because Jason Taylor wants VAST on Azure Marketplace, and Lior believes pushing Marketplace too early could backfire.

- Jason Vallery said that before Renan’s New Jersey meeting with Kushal, Jason attempted to secure a data center tour for Renan and in the process “pissed off Sagar” (unknown last name) while pulling favors to make it happen.

- Jason Vallery said Kushal told him that Mustafa’s chief of staff, Majid, would attend the data center tour, and Kushal suggested that if the goal is a Renan-Mustafa meeting, that could be arranged in January.

- Jason Vallery said that in the actual Renan meeting, Majid did not show up and the attendees were Kushal and a couple of Kushal’s direct reports, including someone Jason heard as “Boomi” and another person possibly named Rohit (uncertain).

- Lior Genzel has been exchanging messages with Kushal (Microsoft MAI contact) and is trying to set an introductory call between Kushal and Alon Horev so Kushal can meet VAST Data leadership and invite additional MAI stakeholders.

- Jason Vallery believes Microsoft MAI has undergone significant org changes and hiring, creating confusion about whether Kushal and Vipin now share the same manager; historically they were in different parts of MAI (Vipin in infrastructure operations, Kushal in business and future requirements/vision).

- Jason Vallery saw an MAI org chart screenshot shared by Jack Kabat that showed a manager named 'Young Chow' as Kushal's manager, which Jason considered a change from prior structure; Jason noted this manager came from Verkada (video surveillance company).

- Lior Genzel asked Leah to provide the reporting chain ('flow chart all the way up') for the five MAI contacts VAST Data interacts with, including who reports to whom and what each person does.

- Lior Genzel stated that Kushal and Vipin are dissatisfied with Azure storage capabilities and believe 'Azure is not good enough' for MAI needs.

- Jason Vallery described a Microsoft cultural principle that Microsoft is a platform company that 'eats its own dog food', meaning internal teams are pressured to build on Azure so Azure improves, which can conflict with MAI teams seeking non-Azure solutions.

- Jason Vallery recalled that in a meeting with Anson (Qi) at Supercomputing, Anson described Project Apollo's thesis as moving fast by using and contributing to open source and hiring people from open source communities, which Jason viewed as atypical for Microsoft teams he worked in.

- Lior Genzel expects an answer during the week of 2026-01-05 on whether Renan will have a mid-January Davos meeting with Satya Nadella; meeting requests were made via Leah and were not yet approved.

- Lior Genzel stated a Davos meeting request also exists with Jason Taylor, but Lior believes a Jason Taylor meeting is less valuable and could backfire because Jason Taylor primarily wants VAST Data on Azure Marketplace, which Lior considers a late-stage step.

- Jason Vallery previously asked Kushal whether Mustafa would attend a Microsoft MAI data center tour; Kushal said Mustafa would not attend, but Mustafa's chief of staff Majid would attend along with Kushal and Kushal's team, and Kushal suggested a Renan-to-Mustafa meeting could happen in January.

- Jason Vallery stated that while trying to arrange the MAI data center tour for Renan, Jason 'pissed off Sagar' during the process (context: pulling favors to make the tour happen).

- In the Renan meeting with Kushal in New Jersey, Majid did not show up; attendees were Kushal and a couple of Kushal's direct reports, including someone named Boomi and another person possibly named Rohit.
