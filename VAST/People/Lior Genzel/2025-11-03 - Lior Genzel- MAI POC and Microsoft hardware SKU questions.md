# Lior Genzel: MAI POC and Microsoft hardware SKU questions

**Date**: 2025-11-03
**With**: Jason Vallery, Lior Genzel

## Summary

Notes capture an open set of questions around a Microsoft-provided hardware SKU, a proof of concept with Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI), and what the implications are for VAST. Also flags a need to connect this to broader Voice of Customer (VoC) signals and potential relevance to Google.


## Action Items


- [?] Clarify what the Microsoft-provided hardware SKU is (exact SKU name, configuration, and intended deployment model) and how it impacts VAST Data positioning for MAI. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Define the MAI POC: success criteria, architecture assumptions, required VAST components, and who owns execution on the Microsoft side. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Collect and summarize broader Voice of Customer (VoC) inputs related to MAI and hardware SKU expectations, and map them to VAST product gaps or opportunities. @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Assess whether any learnings from the MAI hardware SKU and POC should inform VAST's Google Cloud Platform (GCP) integration or Google partnership messaging. @Myself #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- A discussion topic with Lior Genzel was a potential proof of concept (POC) involving Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) and a Microsoft-provided hardware SKU, but the meaning and implications for VAST were not yet clear in the notes.
