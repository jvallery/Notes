# AI talk and community Q&A

**Date**: 2025-12-15
**With**: Justin Veach, Jason Vallery, Emily Vallery, Tim Waters, Elizabeth

## Summary

Jason Vallery (Vast Data) presented an overview of rapid AI progress (agents, robotics, compute/data exponentials) and discussed implications for Longmont across education, local business, city governance/privacy, digital divide, and community resilience. Q&A focused on defense/ethics, regulation and data ownership, energy/climate tradeoffs, and risks from malicious actors more than “robot sentience.” The event concluded with a call to join the Longmont Next Wave Initiative, take a survey, and attend a follow-up discussion at Longmont Public Media on 2026-01-15.
## Action Items
- [ ] Host/attend the next Longmont Next Wave Initiative discussion at Longmont Public Media (5:30 p.m.). @TBD 📅 2026-01-15 #task
- [ ] Share the Longmont Next Wave Initiative survey link/QR code with friends/neighbors to gather community sentiment. @TBD #task
- [ ] Send participants a copy of the slide deck and follow-up resources to those who provided an email via the QR survey. @Jason #task

## Key Information
- Jason Vallery is VP of Product Management at Vast Data; previously spent ~13 years at Microsoft working on storage/data infrastructure for AI customers including OpenAI.
- ChatGPT reached 100M users in ~2 months after launch (Nov 2022); Jason stated ~800M active users and >1B users across major chatbots.
- Jason described a shift from chatbots to agentic AI (autonomous agents) as a key 2024 milestone.
- AI progress is driven by exponentials in compute and data; Jason cited Moore’s-law-like acceleration and recent NVIDIA chip generations doubling faster than 24 months.
- Jason cited a gigawatt-scale AI training site in Abilene, Texas (~120 acres, 32 data halls, ~1.2 GW) and said there are 22 similar sites in development.
- Platte River Power Authority peak production cited as ~720 MW on a hot July day; Rawhide Unit 1 cited as ~280 MW capacity.
- Jason cited a McKinsey study claiming current AI capabilities could automate ~57% of knowledge-worker tasks in Fortune 500 companies.
- Key risks emphasized: malicious use (cyber, autonomous weapons/drones), privacy/surveillance, widening digital divide, and a future crisis of purpose as work changes.
- Jason advocated for governance focused on data ownership/controls and “human-in-the-loop” decision frameworks; contrasted with China’s social credit approach.
- Emily Vallery announced the Longmont Next Wave Initiative and a follow-up event at Longmont Public Media on 2026-01-15 at 5:30 p.m.
