# 1:1 with Kanchan Mehrotra, align on MAI and UK Met Office to drive Azure storage-optimized hardware shape for VAST

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**With**: Jason Vallery, Kanchan Mehrotra

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Kanchan Mehrotra aligned to prioritize Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) and the UK Met Office as flagship customer wins to create pull for an Azure hardware shape that makes VAST economics and networking viable. They agreed on a dual-track plan: progress Azure Marketplace readiness while escalating requirements with Igal Figlin's team and MAI stakeholders, and coordinate messaging at Supercomputing and a follow-on internal alignment session with Nidhi.

## Decisions

- Prioritize Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) and the UK Met Office as near-term anchor wins to drive an Azure hardware shape suitable for VAST, rather than pursuing a broad Azure sales motion immediately.

- Run a dual-track plan: advance the Azure marketplace listing work while simultaneously pursuing flagship customer escalations (MAI and UK Met Office) to create internal pull for improved Azure storage-optimized hardware shapes.

- Engage Nidhi to re-energize internal advocacy only after the marketplace offer and the customer story (including economics) are ready to present.

## Key Information

- Kanchan Mehrotra is shifting focus to work more on OpenAI and Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) engagements, including technical problem-solving and operationalizing third-party GPU capacity inside Azure.

- GPU supply constraints, not demand, are limiting Microsoft’s ability to allocate third-party GPU capacity to customers, slowing new large third-party GPU deals despite continued high demand.

- VAST’s current hyperscaler go-to-market constraint is reliance on compute SKUs with local NVMe (for example Azure L-series), where the compute-to-storage ratio makes VAST deployments financially non-viable at exabyte scale.

- Azure LSv4 is the only current Azure option for VAST’s NVMe-based deployment approach, but it has poor economics and networking characteristics for scale, including too many CPU cores per storage, weak networking, and low drive density.

- LSv5 is planned and committed by Igal Figlin’s team, but it is far out and may still be bandwidth-limited for UK Met Office requirements.

- VAST claims an exabyte-scale deployment can be delivered with approximately 20 VAST racks versus approximately 240 racks of Azure Blob Storage for the same logical capacity, implying about 10x higher rack density for VAST.

- VAST claims power consumption for exabyte-scale storage in MAI Falcon-type clusters can be approximately one-fifth compared to alternatives, driven by higher density and fewer racks.

- Azure Storage is unlikely to champion VAST internally, so progress requires support via Igal Figlin’s team and customer-driven escalations from marquee lighthouse accounts.

- Target lighthouse customers identified for driving Azure hardware shape changes are Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) and the UK Met Office, with existing MAI relationships including Kushal and Vipin Sachdeva.

- MAI already has CoreWeave capacity available, and VAST capacity exists in CoreWeave, while MAI interest in running VAST on Azure remains active.

- Marketplace control plane work from Yancey’s team is being integrated, with Google marketplace first and Azure marketplace targeted around February (year not specified).

- Neo cloud GPU-adjacent storage was identified as an opportunity to keep GPUs productive during network disconnects by targeting a GPU-to-local-storage ratio and deploying storage adjacent to GPU capacity.

- VAST has a high-performance KV-store called Undivided Attention positioned for long-term memory use cases, and Microsoft previously declined to build a similar capability.

- Kanchan Mehrotra is increasingly focused on Microsoft OpenAI engagement and Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI), including technical problem-solving and supporting 3P GPU customer deployments in Azure.

- Microsoft has strong demand for 3P GPU deals in Azure, but GPU supply constraints are limiting how much capacity can be allocated to 3P customers.

- For VAST deployments on Azure, the current viable compute option is Azure LSv4, but its economics and networking are not suitable for large-scale VAST storage deployments because it has too many CPU cores relative to storage, weak networking, and low drive density.

- LSv5 is planned and is described as committed by Igal Figlin's team, but it is far out and may still be bandwidth-limited for UK Met Office requirements.

- VAST claims that delivering approximately 1 exabyte of capacity can require about 20 VAST racks versus about 240 racks of Azure Blob Storage, implying roughly 10x rack density improvement for the same logical capacity.

- VAST claims power consumption for storage in MAI Falcon-type clusters can be approximately one-fifth compared to alternatives, driven by higher density and fewer racks.

- Azure Storage is unlikely to champion VAST as a partner; progress likely requires support via Igal Figlin's team and customer-driven pull from marquee lighthouse customers.

- MAI already has CoreWeave capacity available, and VAST capacity exists in CoreWeave, while MAI interest in VAST on Azure remains active.

- Marketplace control plane work (from Yancey's team) is being integrated; Google Marketplace is planned first, with Azure Marketplace targeted around February (year not specified).

- Neo cloud GPU-adjacent storage is viewed as an opportunity to keep GPUs productive during network disconnects by maintaining a GPU-to-local-storage ratio.

- VAST has a high-performance KV-store called Undivided Attention that is positioned as suitable for long-term memory use cases; Microsoft previously declined to build a similar KV-store internally.
