# 1:1 with Kanchan Mehrotra (Koncha), align on MAI + UK Met Office as marquee wins to drive Azure hardware shape

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**With**: Jason Vallery, Kanchan Mehrotra

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Kanchan Mehrotra (called "Koncha" in the transcript) aligned on prioritizing Microsoft MAI and the UK Met Office as flagship wins to create executive pull for an Azure hardware shape that is economically viable for VAST. They discussed why current Azure L-series VM shapes (LSv4) are a poor fit for VAST, the expected but delayed LSv5 path, and a dual-track plan to keep Azure Marketplace moving while pushing leadership for a better hardware model.


## Action Items


- [?] Meet Kushal (Microsoft MAI) to discuss VAST opportunities and clarify the "not really Azure" capacity hint. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Reconnect with Vipin Sachdeva (Microsoft MAI) to re-engage VAST. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Build an internal comparative economics deck for a 1 EB deployment comparing VAST on Azure LSv4, Azure LSv5, and on-prem versus Azure Blob HDD and Azure Blob Flash, to support the Azure hardware shape ask. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate a review meeting with Nidhi to walk through the comparative deck and align on the MAI plus UK Met Office plan. @Kanchan Mehrotra 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Meet UK Met Office stakeholders (Mike Kiernan, Nico, Allen) at Supercomputing to push the VAST path and surface Azure LSv5 networking needs. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Speak with Egal to push on Azure LSv5 shape and networking and bandwidth requirements and align on timelines. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Align the joint VAST-Azure story for Supercomputing and Ignite (booths and panel) with Andrew, Joe Green, and Lior. @Kanchan Mehrotra 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Check if Suresh will attend Supercomputing; if yes, set up a Neo cloud storage discussion with Jason Vallery; if not, schedule later. @Kanchan Mehrotra 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide input and content for Egal’s keynote slide referencing VAST. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Progress the Azure Marketplace offer (initially LSv4-based), track ETA, and be ready to brief sellers once the offer is credible. @TBD 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Clarify MAI’s incremental opportunity and where capacity will be located after the Kushal meeting. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Validate GPU-adjacent storage ratio guidance for Neo clouds with Suresh and Anand, and explore Microsoft usage models (lease vs 1P vs Azure-sold) that would enable VAST. @Kanchan Mehrotra 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Keep Kurt informed so sellers remember VAST when qualifying 3P GPU deals. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Track Wave’s 40 PB request and assess a viable Azure configuration or alternatives, then report back. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm Nidhi’s Ignite and Supercomputing schedule and lock a time to review the comparative deck. @Kanchan Mehrotra 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Prioritize Microsoft MAI and the UK Met Office as flagship wins to create executive pull for an Azure hardware shape that is economically viable for VAST deployments.

- Run a dual track: continue progressing Azure Marketplace offers while simultaneously driving a leadership-backed path to improved Azure hardware shapes and networking for VAST.

- Defer broad seller-led sales pushes for VAST on Azure until there is a credible Azure product and SKU path that meets customer economics.




## Key Information


- Kanchan Mehrotra is increasingly focused on Microsoft OpenAI engagement and Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI), including technical problem-solving and supporting 3P GPU customer deployments in Azure.

- Microsoft 3P GPU demand remains high, but deal velocity is constrained primarily by GPU supply limitations rather than lack of demand.

- Jason Vallery’s cloud GTM constraint for VAST on hyperscalers is that current go-to-market requires compute SKUs with local NVMe, and the compute-to-storage ratio on those SKUs makes large-scale VAST deployments financially non-viable for exabyte-class needs.

- Azure LSv4 is a poor fit for VAST due to too many CPU cores per storage, weak networking, and low NVMe density, which drives poor cost-performance and customer sticker shock.

- Azure LSv5 is described as committed by Egal’s team but expected to be roughly a year or more out, and networking plans may still be insufficient for UK Met Office price-performance targets.

- VAST can deliver approximately 1 EB of logical storage in about 20 racks versus approximately 240 racks for Blob storage, implying about a 10x rack density advantage for VAST in comparable scenarios.

- MAI has existing affinity for VAST, with champions including Kushal and Vipin Sachdeva.

- Azure NetApp Files is cited as prior art for a partner-hardware-in-Azure model that could be a viable pattern for VAST via OEM/ODM relationships.

- Marketplace control plane from Yancey’s team was acquired by VAST, with Google first and Azure expected to follow (internal tracking suggests early next year).
