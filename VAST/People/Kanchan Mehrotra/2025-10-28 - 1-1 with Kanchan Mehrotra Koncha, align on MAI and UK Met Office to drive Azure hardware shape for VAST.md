# 1:1 with Kanchan Mehrotra (Koncha), align on MAI and UK Met Office to drive Azure hardware shape for VAST

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**With**: Jason Vallery, Kanchan Mehrotra

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Kanchan Mehrotra (called "Koncha" in the transcript) aligned on prioritizing Microsoft MAI and the UK Met Office as flagship wins to create executive pull for an Azure hardware shape that is economically viable for VAST. They discussed why current Azure L-series VM shapes (LSv4) are a poor fit for VAST, the expected but delayed LSv5 path, and a dual-track plan to keep Azure Marketplace moving while pushing leadership for a better hardware model.

## Decisions

- Prioritize Microsoft MAI and the UK Met Office as flagship wins to create executive pull for an Azure hardware shape that is economically viable for VAST deployments.

- Run a dual track: continue progressing Azure Marketplace offers while simultaneously driving a leadership-backed path to improved Azure hardware shapes and networking for VAST.

- Defer broad seller-led sales pushes for VAST on Azure until there is a credible Azure product and SKU path that meets customer economics.

- Prioritize Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) and the UK Met Office as flagship wins to create executive pull for an Azure hardware shape and networking profile that is economically viable for VAST.

- Run a dual track: continue shipping Azure Marketplace offers while simultaneously driving a leadership-backed path to improved Azure VM shapes and networking for VAST.

## Key Information

- Kanchan Mehrotra is increasingly focused on Microsoft OpenAI engagement and Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI), including technical problem-solving and supporting 3P GPU customer deployments in Azure.

- Microsoft 3P GPU demand remains high, but deal velocity is constrained primarily by GPU supply limitations rather than lack of demand.

- Jason Vallery’s cloud GTM constraint for VAST on hyperscalers is that current go-to-market requires compute SKUs with local NVMe, and the compute-to-storage ratio on those SKUs makes large-scale VAST deployments financially non-viable for exabyte-class needs.

- Azure LSv4 is a poor fit for VAST due to too many CPU cores per storage, weak networking, and low NVMe density, which drives poor cost-performance and customer sticker shock.

- Azure LSv5 is described as committed by Egal’s team but expected to be roughly a year or more out, and networking plans may still be insufficient for UK Met Office price-performance targets.

- VAST can deliver approximately 1 EB of logical storage in about 20 racks versus approximately 240 racks for Blob storage, implying about a 10x rack density advantage for VAST in comparable scenarios.

- MAI has existing affinity for VAST, with champions including Kushal and Vipin Sachdeva.

- Azure NetApp Files is cited as prior art for a partner-hardware-in-Azure model that could be a viable pattern for VAST via OEM/ODM relationships.

- Marketplace control plane from Yancey’s team was acquired by VAST, with Google first and Azure expected to follow (internal tracking suggests early next year).

---

- Kanchan Mehrotra is starting to work more on Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) and OpenAI-related engagements, including technical-side support and follow-through on third-party GPU (3P GPU) deals in Azure.

- Microsoft has high demand for third-party GPU (3P GPU) capacity, but near-term deal execution is constrained primarily by supply, not demand.

- Jason Vallery’s cloud strategy constraint for VAST on Azure is that current L-series VM shapes with local NVMe create an unfavorable compute-to-storage ratio, making exabyte-scale deployments economically and physically impractical.

- VAST can deliver approximately 1 EB of storage in about 20 racks versus approximately 240 racks for Azure Blob storage, implying roughly 10x rack density advantage for VAST in comparable logical capacity scenarios.

- Azure LSv4 is described as a poor fit for VAST due to too many CPU cores, weak networking, and low NVMe density, leading to poor cost-performance and customer sticker shock.

- Azure NetApp Files is considered a viable prior-art pattern for bringing partner hardware into Azure, and could be a model for VAST via OEM/ODM-qualified hardware.

- Marketplace control plane from Yancey’s team was acquired by VAST, with Google first and Azure expected to follow later, tracked internally as early next year.
