# Kanchan Mehrotra

## Key Facts

- Kanchan Mehrotra is increasingly focused on Microsoft OpenAI engagement and Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI), including technical problem-solving and supporting 3P GPU customer deployments in Azure.

- Kanchan Mehrotra reported a lukewarm reception from Azure Storage members regarding Fungible DPU maturity, based on prior partner testing requests, and she was not confident recommending it without more validation.

- Kanchan Mehrotra is a key contact for discussions related to storage plays and storage density considerations for Supercomputing (FAST).

- Kanchan Mehrotra agreed to discreetly seed a VAST-optimized Azure storage hardware path with Microsoft leadership (Nidhi and Renan) before engaging Michael Myrah (Azure Storage Hardware) to avoid premature escalation without leadership air cover.

- Fungible DPU readiness risk and alternative NIC/DPU paths (including NVIDIA BlueField-3 mentioned in notes)

- MAI Dallas capacity timing (December 2025 and April 2026) and storage plan influence window
## Key Decisions

- Prioritize Microsoft MAI and the UK Met Office as flagship wins to create executive pull for an Azure hardware shape that is economically viable for VAST deployments.

- Run a dual track: continue progressing Azure Marketplace offers while simultaneously driving a leadership-backed path to improved Azure hardware shapes and networking for VAST.

- Defer broad seller-led sales pushes for VAST on Azure until there is a credible Azure product and SKU path that meets customer economics.

- Jason Vallery will not contact Michael Myrah directly to avoid premature escalation; Kanchan Mehrotra will open the thread when internal Microsoft alignment is ready (after Nidhi buy-in).

- Primary engagement path is to pursue a unified VAST-on-Azure-storage-hardware story via Azure Storage hardware ownership (Michael Myrah), with Azure Dedicated (Anand) considered as a parallel option if needed.

- Prioritize Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) and the UK Met Office as near-term anchor wins, rather than pursuing a broad Azure sales motion.

- Run a dual-track plan: advance Azure Marketplace readiness while driving flagship customer escalations to influence Azure hardware shape and networking requirements.

- Engage Nidhi to amplify internal advocacy after the Azure Marketplace offer and the MAI and UK Met Office story are ready.

- Prioritize exploring a storage-hardware-led path (VAST bare metal on Azure storage hardware) over VM-based approaches (Lsv4/Lsv5) to meet performance and exabyte-scale efficiency requirements for Microsoft MAI and Apollo.

- Do not engage Michael Myrah (Azure Storage Hardware) directly until Kanchan Mehrotra confirms leadership support from Nidhi to reduce political risk and increase likelihood of a viable Azure storage SKU path.

- Use NVIDIA DGX Cloud reference storage compliance (VAST and Weka meeting throughput requirements) as an executive-level justification to accelerate alignment with Microsoft leadership (Nidhi and Renan).
