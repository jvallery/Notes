# Renen Hallak update: Crusoe file recovery effort and CES NAND allocation focus

**Date**: 2026-01-04
**Project**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Renen Hallak

## Summary

Renen Hallak shared an internal update describing a two-week R&D effort to recover nearly 200,000 files on Crusoe's cluster by building an automated recovery system. He also noted he will travel to Las Vegas for CES to help Operations secure NAND allocation amid flash shortages and emphasized cross-geo collaboration as a driver of innovation.






## Key Information


- Renen Hallak reported that for the prior two weeks, a significant portion of VAST Data R&D was redirected to build an auxiliary system to recover nearly 200,000 files on Crusoe's cluster, evolving from manual to semi-automatic to fully automatic recovery.

- Renen Hallak stated the Crusoe incident required recovering every piece of customer data and that VAST Data is committed to never losing a single bit of customer data and maintaining a perfect record.

- Renen Hallak said he is going to Las Vegas for CES during the upcoming week to help VAST Data Operations secure NAND allocation due to flash shortages and the need to build strategic relationships with major flash vendors.

- Renen Hallak claimed VAST Data has grown to account for more than 10% of the data center NAND market, increasing the importance of strategic relationships with major flash vendors.

- Renen Hallak observed strengthened collaboration between teams across geographies as VAST Data hires more R&D outside Israel and more G&A in Israel, widening the operational bridge across the ocean.
