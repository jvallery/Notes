# Renen Hallak update: Crusoe file recovery automation and CES NAND allocation outreach

**Date**: 2026-01-04
**Project**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Renen Hallak

## Summary

Renen Hallak shared an internal update describing a two-week R&D effort to recover nearly 200,000 files on Crusoe's cluster by building an automated recovery system, after initially using manual and semi-automatic approaches. He also noted he will travel to Las Vegas for CES the week of 2026-01-05 to help Ops secure NAND allocation and strengthen relationships with major flash vendors amid shortages, citing VAST's growing share of the data center NAND market.


## Action Items


- [?] Capture a post-incident write-up for the Crusoe cluster recovery effort, including root cause (if known), recovery mechanism design, validation steps, and preventive actions to avoid recurrence. @TBD #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with VAST Data Operations on CES flash vendor meetings to support NAND allocation discussions and ensure follow-up owners are assigned for each vendor relationship. @TBD 📅 2026-01-05 #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Renen Hallak stated that for the prior two weeks, a significant portion of VAST Data R&D was redirected to build an auxiliary system to recover nearly 200,000 files on Crusoe's cluster, evolving from manual to semi-automatic to fully automatic recovery.

- Renen Hallak stated that VAST Data successfully built a fully automatic recovery mechanism to fix the Crusoe cluster issue and recover all affected data, reinforcing VAST's commitment to not losing customer data.

- Renen Hallak stated he will travel to Las Vegas during the week of 2026-01-05 to help the VAST Data Operations team secure NAND allocation at CES due to flash supply shortages.

- Renen Hallak stated that VAST Data has grown to account for more than 10% of the data center NAND market and therefore needs strategic relationships with major flash vendors, especially during shortages.

- Renen Hallak observed increased cross-geo collaboration at VAST Data as the company hires more R&D outside Israel and more G&A in Israel, widening the operational bridge between regions.
