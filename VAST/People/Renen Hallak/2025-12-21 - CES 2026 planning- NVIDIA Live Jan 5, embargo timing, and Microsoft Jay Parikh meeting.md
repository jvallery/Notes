## Summary

Internal VAST thread aligning CES 2026 strategy around NVIDIA announcements, including the NVIDIA Live event on January 5 and an embargo lift at 3:00pm PT for NVIDIA CME news. Renen Hallak confirmed he will meet flash vendors and cannot change dates or do interviews, while Kirstin Bordner proposed arriving January 5 and using John Mao for press interviews. Team also wants to arrange a meeting with Microsoft EVP Jay Parikh while in Las Vegas.


## Action Items


- [?] Arrange a meeting in Las Vegas during CES with Microsoft EVP Jay Parikh (CoreAI) by coordinating with the Microsoft team. @TBD 📅 2026-01-05 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Register Renen Hallak for the NVIDIA Live event at CES on January 5, 2026 at 1:00pm PT (Fontainebleau), if he can attend. @Kirstin Bordner 📅 2026-01-05 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Approve the VAST mentions in NVIDIA press releases (CME press release, NVIDIA Rubin press release, and Open Models press release) since NVIDIA is requesting approval but not a VAST quote. @TBD 📅 2025-12-22 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Jeff Denworth to approve the new BF4 blog written by Nicole and share it with Kirstin Bordner so she can draft a VAST press release aligned to the NVIDIA CME embargo lift. @Jeff Denworth 📅 2025-12-22 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule a content review meeting on Monday, December 29, 2025 with Renen Hallak and Gilad (last name unknown) and include at least one California-based team member working on Jensen Huang's NVIDIA press conference presentation. @Marianne Budnik 📅 2025-12-29 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Develop a CES media strategy to engage journalists and insert VAST into NVIDIA launch coverage, including considering a VAST "available now" press release pointing to Asaf Levy's demo and sending it to NVIDIA for review. @Kirstin Bordner 📅 2025-12-22 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Create or identify VAST supporting content for the NVIDIA Rubin platform press release, since Kirstin Bordner noted there is currently no VAST content for Rubin. @TBD 📅 2026-01-05 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Renen Hallak will keep his CES schedule focused on flash vendor meetings and will not allocate time for press interviews.

- VAST will use John Mao for CES press interviews because Renen Hallak will be tied up with flash vendor meetings.
