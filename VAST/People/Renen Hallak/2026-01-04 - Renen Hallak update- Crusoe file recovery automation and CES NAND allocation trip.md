# Renen Hallak update: Crusoe file recovery automation and CES NAND allocation trip

**Date**: 2026-01-04
**Project**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Renen Hallak

## Summary

Renen Hallak shared an internal update describing a two-week R&D effort to recover nearly 200,000 files on Crusoe's cluster by building an automated recovery system, meeting a customer deadline after multiple all-nighters. He also noted he will travel to Las Vegas for CES to help Ops secure NAND allocation amid flash shortages and highlighted increased cross-geo collaboration as a driver of innovation.


## Action Items


- [?] Capture a post-incident writeup for the Crusoe cluster recovery effort, including root cause (if known), recovery tooling approach (manual to fully automatic), validation steps proving all ~200,000 files were recovered, and follow-on prevention actions. @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with VAST Data Ops on CES flash vendor meetings to support NAND allocation planning, including target vendors, required allocation volumes, and relationship owners. @TBD #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Renen Hallak stated that for the prior two weeks a significant portion of VAST Data R&D was redirected to build an auxiliary system to recover nearly 200,000 files on Crusoe's cluster, evolving from manual to semi-automatic to fully automatic recovery.

- Renen Hallak stated the Crusoe incident required recovering every piece of customer data and that VAST Data is committed to never losing a single bit of customer data and maintaining a perfect record.

- Renen Hallak stated that after a crisis was averted the prior week, he is traveling to Las Vegas for CES the upcoming week to help the VAST Data Ops team secure NAND allocation and build strategic relationships with major flash vendors during a shortage.

- Renen Hallak stated that VAST Data has grown to account for more than 10% of the data center NAND market, increasing the need for strategic relationships with major flash vendors.

- Renen Hallak observed strengthened collaboration between VAST Data teams across geographies as the company hires more R&D outside Israel and more G&A in Israel, and he linked this cross-cultural bridge to innovation.
