# CES 2026 planning, NVIDIA Live (Jan 5) and attempt to meet Microsoft EVP Jay Parikh

**Date**: 2025-12-21
**Project**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Renen Hallak, Kirstin Bordner, Marianne Budnik, Jeff Denworth, Jay Parikh, John Mao, Roland, Asaf Levy, Idan, Ranen Carmel, Sagi, Lior Cohen, Gilad, Nicole

## Summary

Internal VAST thread aligning CES 2026 strategy around NVIDIA Live on January 5 (1pm PT) and the 3pm PT embargo lift for NVIDIA CME news, with supporting VAST blog, demo, and press release. Renen Hallak cannot change travel dates due to flash vendor meetings and has no time for interviews, but will add the Microsoft team to arrange a meeting with Jay Parikh (Microsoft EVP, CoreAI) who is participating in Roland's January 6 keynote.


## Action Items


- [?] Arrange a meeting in Las Vegas with Jay Parikh (EVP, CoreAI at Microsoft) during CES, coordinating with the Microsoft team that Renen Hallak is adding to the thread. @TBD 📅 2026-01-05 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Register Renen Hallak for NVIDIA Live at CES (January 5, 2026 at 1:00 PM PT, Fontainebleau) if he confirms attendance. @Kirstin Bordner 📅 2026-01-05 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Approve the VAST mentions in NVIDIA press releases (CME, Rubin, Open Models) since NVIDIA is requesting approval of mentions rather than a VAST quote. @TBD 📅 2025-12-22 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Jeff Denworth to approve the new BF4 blog written by Nicole and share it with Kirstin Bordner so she can draft a VAST press release aligned to the NVIDIA CME embargo lift. @Jeff Denworth 📅 2025-12-22 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule a review meeting on Monday, December 29, 2025 with Renen Hallak and Gilad, including at least one person from the California team working on Jensen's CES press conference presentation, to review slides/animation and ensure advocacy alignment. @Marianne Budnik 📅 2025-12-29 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Create or source VAST content for the NVIDIA Rubin platform announcement topic, since Kirstin Bordner noted there is currently no supporting VAST asset for Rubin. @TBD 📅 2026-01-05 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Use John Mao for CES press interviews to insert VAST into NVIDIA CES news cycle while Renen Hallak is meeting flash vendors. @Kirstin Bordner 📅 2026-01-06 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- VAST will prioritize inserting into NVIDIA Live (January 5, 2026) and the CME embargo lift (3:00 PM PT) rather than focusing on the Siemens keynote for the BF4/inference effort.

- Renen Hallak will keep his flash vendor meeting schedule and will not allocate time for press interviews; VAST will use John Mao for press interviews instead.




## Key Information


- NVIDIA is hosting an open event called "NVIDIA Live" at CES on January 5, 2026 starting at 1:00 PM PT at the Fontainebleau in Las Vegas.

- The embargo for NVIDIA's CME announcement lifts at 3:00 PM PT on January 5, 2026, and VAST plans to align its blog, demo, and press release timing to that embargo lift.

- Renen Hallak stated he is going to meet flash vendors during CES and cannot change his dates; he also stated he has no time for press interviews.

- Jay Parikh is EVP for CoreAI at Microsoft and is participating in Roland's January 6, 2026 keynote that includes NVIDIA and executives from Microsoft, PepsiCo, and Commonwealth Fusion Systems.

- Marianne Budnik clarified that Jensen Huang does not have his own CES keynote; he is joining the Siemens CEO onstage as part of the Siemens Day 2 CES keynote.

- NVIDIA is doing a 90-minute media-only press conference at CES, and VAST's goal is to be shown as a leading solution in the media briefing and amplify it online.

- VAST is working with Asaf Levy and NVIDIA's Israel team (including Idan and Ranen Carmel, NVIDIA Creative Director based in Tel Aviv) on slides and animation for CES-related content.

- NVIDIA sent VAST two additional press releases requesting VAST inclusion: the NVIDIA Rubin press release and the Open Models press release; VAST is not being asked to provide a quote, only to approve VAST mentions.

- A supporting blog post for the Open Models press release is being worked on by Sagi together with Lior Cohen from NVIDIA.

- Kirstin Bordner added John Mao because he is planning to be in Las Vegas and can be used for press interviews since Renen Hallak will be tied up meeting flash vendors.

- Kirstin Bordner identified three CES news-cycle insertion topics for VAST: NVIDIA CME (blog, press release, demo), Rubin platform (no VAST content yet), and Open Models/Cosmos Reason (supporting blog exists).
