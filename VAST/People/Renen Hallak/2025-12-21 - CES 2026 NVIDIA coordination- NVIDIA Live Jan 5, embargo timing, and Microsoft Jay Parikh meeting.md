# CES 2026 NVIDIA coordination: NVIDIA Live (Jan 5), embargo timing, and Microsoft Jay Parikh meeting

**Date**: 2025-12-21
**Attendees**: Renen Hallak, Kirstin Bordner, Marianne Budnik, Jeff Denworth, Jay Parikh, Asaf Levy, Idan (NVIDIA, Israel team), Ranen Carmel, Gilad (last name unknown), Roland (last name unknown), Jensen Huang, John Mao, Sagi (last name unknown), Lior Cohen, Nicole (last name unknown)

## Summary

Internal VAST thread aligning CES plans around NVIDIA announcements. Key points include NVIDIA Live on January 5 at 1:00pm PT with a 3:00pm PT embargo lift for the NVIDIA CME announcement, plus a push to meet Microsoft EVP Jay Parikh in Las Vegas. Renen Hallak cannot change travel dates due to flash vendor meetings and has no time for press interviews, so Kirstin Bordner proposes using John Mao for interviews and filling content gaps (notably Rubin).

## Action Items

- [?] Arrange a meeting with Microsoft EVP Jay Parikh (CoreAI) during CES in Las Vegas by coordinating with the Microsoft team. @TBD 📅 2026-01-05 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Register Renen Hallak for the NVIDIA Live event at CES on January 5, 2026 at 1:00pm PT at the Fontainebleau (if he plans to attend). @Kirstin Bordner 📅 2026-01-05 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Approve VAST mentions in NVIDIA press releases (NVIDIA CME press release, NVIDIA Rubin press release, and Open Models press release) since NVIDIA is requesting approval but not a VAST quote. @TBD 📅 2025-12-22 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Jeff Denworth to approve the new BF4 blog written by Nicole (last name unknown) and share it with Kirstin Bordner so she can draft a VAST press release. @Jeff Denworth 📅 2025-12-22 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule a review meeting on Monday, December 29, 2025 with Renen Hallak and Gilad (last name unknown), including at least one California team member working on Jensen Huang's NVIDIA press conference presentation, to review CES press conference slides/animation and talk track. @Marianne Budnik 📅 2025-12-29 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Develop a CES media strategy to engage journalists and insert VAST into NVIDIA launch coverage, including considering a VAST "available now" press release pointing to Asaf Levy's demo and sending it to NVIDIA for review. @Kirstin Bordner 📅 2025-12-22 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Identify and create missing VAST collateral for the NVIDIA Rubin platform press release (currently no supporting content). @TBD 📅 2026-01-05 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Approve the VAST mentions in NVIDIA press releases (CME press release, NVIDIA Rubin press release, and Open Models press release) since NVIDIA is requesting approval but not a VAST quote. @TBD 📅 2025-12-22 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Jeff Denworth to approve the new BF4 blog written by Nicole and share it with Kirstin Bordner so she can draft a VAST press release aligned to the NVIDIA CME embargo lift. @Jeff Denworth 📅 2025-12-22 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule a content review meeting on Monday, December 29, 2025 with Renen Hallak and Gilad (last name unknown) and include at least one California-based team member working on Jensen Huang's NVIDIA press conference presentation. @Marianne Budnik 📅 2025-12-29 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

## Decisions

- Renen Hallak will keep his CES schedule focused on flash vendor meetings and will not allocate time for press interviews.

- VAST will pursue arranging a meeting with Microsoft EVP Jay Parikh during CES by involving the Microsoft team.

- VAST will use John Mao for CES press interviews because Renen Hallak will be tied up with flash vendor meetings.

## Key Information

- NVIDIA is hosting an event called "NVIDIA Live" at CES on January 5, 2026 starting at 1:00pm PT at the Fontainebleau; it is open to anyone and is not a press conference.

- The embargo for NVIDIA's CME announcement lifts at 3:00pm PT on January 5, 2026, which is when VAST can publish related blog, demo, and press release content.

- Renen Hallak plans to meet flash vendors during CES and stated he cannot change dates and has no time for press interviews.

- Jay Parikh is EVP for CoreAI at Microsoft and is participating in Roland's CES keynote on January 6, 2026; VAST wants to meet him while in Las Vegas.

- Marianne Budnik clarified that Jensen Huang does not have his own CES keynote; he is joining the Siemens CEO onstage as part of the Siemens Day 2 CES keynote.

- NVIDIA is doing a 90-minute media-only press conference at CES; content from that session will not be broadly shown, so VAST plans to amplify online to create broad visibility.

- VAST is working with Asaf Levy and NVIDIA's Israel team (including Idan and Ranen Carmel, NVIDIA Creative Director based in Tel Aviv) on slides and animation for NVIDIA CES materials; Jeff Denworth is driving the talk track.

- NVIDIA requested VAST be included in two additional press releases: the NVIDIA Rubin press release and the Open Models press release; NVIDIA is not requesting a VAST quote, only approval of VAST mentions.

- A VAST blog post supporting the Open Models press release is being worked on by Sagi (last name unknown) together with Lior Cohen from NVIDIA.

- Kirstin Bordner identified three CES news-cycle insertion topics for VAST: CME (blog, press release, demo), Rubin platform (no VAST content yet), and Open Models/Cosmos Reason (supporting blog exists).
