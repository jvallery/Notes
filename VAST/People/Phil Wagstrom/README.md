## Key Facts

- Andy’s team operates across four pillars: field escalation/POC support, lab management/benchmarks, SE enablement/training plus PM augmentation, and marketing support.
- Documentation is currently feature/button-oriented and not scenario-driven; scenario guides are ad hoc and late.
- PM process gaps include training ownership, PRDs vs FRDs (engineering writes FRDs), release visibility, and access to builds/docs.
- OVA is a single-VM multi-container demo; requires ~128GB RAM host; client networking requires tunneling/proxies; unsupported.
- SE Lab access requires VPN plus an AD account via octo.selab.fastdata.com; multiple clusters exist with varying admin levels.
- GitLab access is restricted and requires an IT ticket for a licensed account.
- Implementation reviews are run by Galit/Orly; Confluence release pages (e.g., 5.4 dev) list features, owners, and FRDs.
- Sync Engine lacks a formal PM; Andy and Blake are acting PMs.
- OpenAI architecture pattern described: multi-exabyte lakes in 3 Azure regions; GPUs in 50+ regions plus other providers; GPU-adjacent cache with checkpoints back to central.
- Urgent need: Sync Engine must read from Azure Blob to support large migrations (wave.ai) on a December timeline; key engineer Aaron Zilber is OOO ~2.5 weeks.

## Background

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Use Phil Wagstrom as primary multi-tenancy SME contact.
- ✅ Proceed with OVA and SE Lab access for Jason’s learning.
- ✅ Schedule a follow-up focused on OpenAI architecture and needs.
- ✅ Reframe outreach to focus on concrete pipeline components (Kafka for RL, real-time vector DB) rather than platform narratives.
- ✅ Use an NVIDIA-customer event (via AI Circle) as the primary NVIDIA intro mechanism; direct 1:1 intros from NVIDIA reps are unlikely.
- ✅ Broaden persona targeting to include data/pipeline owners, not just CTO-level contacts.
- ✅ Defer direct Google/Microsoft-introduced paths where conflicts exist to reduce hyperscaler conflict risk.
