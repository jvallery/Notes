## Key Facts

- Walmart uses Azure for dot-com systems and GCP (BigQuery/GCS) for enterprise analytics.
- Walmart wants a consistent lakehouse view across GCP and two on-prem sites; two on-prem DCs run active-active with >30 ms latency.
- Immediate ask: two VAST clusters (Region 1/Region 2) in Q4 for pilot testing.
- Scale: ~450 PB initially, growing to ~770 PB by 2029.
- Replication target: ~10% of the lake per day from GCP to on-prem; estimated sustained ~5 Tbps; prior discussions included up to ~10 Tbps targets and ~100 PB/month change rate claims.
- Walmart prefers GCS-compatible APIs; S3-only access is not acceptable long-term.
- Near-term architecture direction: SyncEngine for near-real-time replication from GCS plus DataSpaces across on-prem sites; gaps include GCS API endpoint, stronger consistency/write-lease semantics, and GCS change-feed integration.
- Pilot timeline: now through roughly Sep/Oct next year; decision frame for full project in calendar year 2027; budgets finalize end of next calendar year.
- John owns alliances/partnerships for conventional channels (incl. AMD/NVIDIA) and control-plane partner ecosystem for Tier-2 cloud-in-a-box.
- Morty owns Neo cloud feature requirements; moving to Jason’s team but must keep Neo focus.

## Topics Discussed

Walmart hybrid lakehouse architecture (GCP + two on-prem sites), SyncEngine replication from GCS to on-prem, DataSpaces/global namespace across on-prem sites, GCS API compatibility requirement, Strong consistency challenges and write-lease semantics, Network throughput/egress feasibility for multi-Tbps replication, Pilot/POC scoping using real workloads (Trino/Presto, Spark; Delta/Hudi tables), Governance, multi-tenancy, auditing, and compliance requirements, BigQuery interoperability considerations, Q4 pilot cluster configurations (Region 1/Region 2), Org chart and key leaders across marketing, alliances, SE, sales, finance, Multi-cloud strategy mandate (Azure/AWS/GCP/Oracle) and complement vs compete framing, Cloud packaging and serverless/pipelines gaps, Neo cloud requirements ownership and team transition, Customer Success vs support operating model

**Role**: DM for system engineering (supports SE org; Brad and Paul's boss) (Systems Engineering)
**Relationship**: Internal collaborator

**Background**:
- Introduced as DM for system engineering part of the business; supports Brad and is Paul's boss.

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Use SyncEngine for the pilot to replicate from GCS to on-prem VAST clusters.
- ✅ Pursue GCS API compatibility on the roadmap; S3 alone is insufficient for Walmart.
- ✅ Focus the pilot on real Walmart workloads (tables/queries), not synthetic benchmarks.
- ✅ Consolidate questions and send to Walmart before scheduling the design session.
- ✅ Carl to move to ProServe under Rob.
- ✅ FRDs and detailed customer requirements will be authored/maintained in Confluence.
- ✅ Jason will own multi-cloud strategy end-to-end and catalog in-flight opportunities from a product requirements lens.
- ✅ Establish a monthly touchpoint between Jason and Brandon.
- ✅ Reframe outreach to focus on concrete pipeline components (Kafka for RL, real-time vector DB) rather than platform narratives.
- ✅ Use an NVIDIA-customer event (via AI Circle) as the primary NVIDIA intro mechanism; direct 1:1 intros from NVIDIA reps are unlikely.
