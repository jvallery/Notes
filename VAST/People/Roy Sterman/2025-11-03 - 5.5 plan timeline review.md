# 5.5 plan timeline review

**Date**: 2025-11-03
**With**: Roy, Erwin, Asaf Levy, Yogev Shachar, Thomas, Dan, Shachar, Yaakov, Shelly, Sherry, Jeff, Gregor, Tzu

## Summary

Team reviewed the updated 5.5 release plan and scope: feature freeze next week, beta in January, and restricted release in March, with discussion on the restricted-to-GA gap. Key focus areas included technical debt/resilience, software-defined e-box enablement, cloud scope (Azure GA in 5.5), Query Engine DDL inclusion (without group-by), and multiple hardware/supply-chain risks requiring risk buys and alternate sourcing. Several follow-ups were captured around Broadcom 4.2 justification, BOM/qualification readiness, GMP POC clarity, and HTX dark-site install timing vs December beta readiness.
## Action Items
- [ ] Create OEM guidance matrix for e-box configuration changes (CPU, memory, SSD) with estimated validation timelines @Hardware team 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Evaluate removal of ISOCPU dependency in favor of modern CPU affinity for software-defined e-box @Yogev Shachar 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Schedule alignment meeting on software-defined e-box configuration and CPU/memory implications @Platform team 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Finalize BOM and lab dates/quantities for g-node POC servers and start qualification work @Dan 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Define plan and timeline for database acceleration targeting GTC (beta goals, milestones) @Yaakov 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Define plan and timeline for database acceleration targeting GTC (beta goals, milestones) @Tzu 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Create justification for Broadcom 4.2 option and schedule discussion @Shelly 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Check and add SMI 3.2 SCM to 5.5 sampling/QA plan and confirm quantities @Shelly 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Submit risk buys for SSDs (E1L, SCM, UW2FMLK) to secure December QA quantities and lock forecast @Shelly 📅 2025-11-04 🔺 #task
- [ ] Ensure alternate drive sources: secure three SCM vendors and three 122 U.2 vendors @Shelly 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Compile list of 5.5 beta customers/features (beyond HTX) for the next 1–2 months @Roy 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Send clarified GMP POC document (5.5 vs 5.6 scope, risks) to stakeholders @Roy 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Review HTX readiness for early-December dark-site production install; align with NFSv4 event triggers beta and adjust plan @HTX team 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Update FRD for AVMS scaling if tests exceed 100K views @AVMS team 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task
- [ ] Decide on MD Migrate rollout strategy for 5.5 (general vs limited customers) and ensure disable/rollback safety @Jeff 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Confirm readiness or deferral for firmware item requiring new procedure @Hardware team 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Revisit restricted-to-GA timeline and confirm plan (target 5–6 weeks) @Roy 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Discuss Broadcom 4.2 path and NVIDIA CX7 supply exposure and agree on mitigation @Shelly 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Clarify Query Engine DDL usefulness and roadmap for aggregations (group-by, sum, count) @Query Engine team 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task
- [ ] Close GMP POC scope, capabilities, and risks; ensure documentation reflects 5.5 vs 5.6 @Roy 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Confirm g-node/Genoa acceleration demo readiness plan for GTC (milestones, owners) @Yaakov 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Validate sample quantities and QA timelines for all listed SSDs and adjust risk buys if needed @Shelly 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task

## Decisions
- Azure GA is part of 5.5; decommission delivered in 5.5 for cloud flows
- Query Engine DDL included in 5.5; group-by not in 5.5
- SMB scale deferred to 5.6
- SPDK target and DB projections moved to 5.6
- NFSv4 delegations view-level added in 5.5
- Physical quota added in 5.5
- SMB server-side copy (SMBX copy) added in 5.5
- Broadcom 4.2 is not currently in 5.5 scope (requires separate justification)

## Key Information
- Feature freeze planned for next week (relative to 2025-11-03); beta in January; restricted release in March
- Restricted-to-GA gap debated; typical target discussed as ~5–6 weeks
- 5.5 emphasis includes technical debt/resilience (NDU latency, install fixes, support bundles, metrics scaling, testability)
- Software-defined e-box path aims to reduce code changes; config-file approach targeted for 5.6
- Cloud scope: AWS/GCP minors exist without decommission; Azure GA planned for 5.5; decommission delivered in 5.5
- Query Engine: DDL in 5.5; group-by excluded; focus on performance
- MD Migrate considered risky for a minor release; disable/rollback safety is a concern; possible limited customer rollout discussed
- NFSv4 event triggers for HTX targeting December beta; early-December dark-site production install timing flagged as risky
- Hardware change management requires firmware updates; one item needs a new procedure not yet ready
- Supply risks on NICs/drives (CX7, SCM, 122 U.2) require alternate sources and risk buys to secure December QA quantities
- Goal to show database acceleration results by GTC (March)
