# Jonsi Stephenson

## Key Facts

- Jonsi Stephenson is the GM of Cloud at VAST Data and previously served as Global CTO and GM of cloud storage at NetApp, where he helped build Azure NetApp Files (ANF).

- Jonsi Stephenson is the GM of Cloud for VAST Data and previously served as Global CTO and GM of cloud storage at NetApp, where he helped build Azure NetApp Files (ANF).

- A Google contact asked Jonsi Stephenson friend-to-friend whether VAST Data would consider being acquired by Google; Jason Vallery responded that VAST Data is 'for sale for the right price' but that replicating the CoreWeave-style deal is more interesting to keep options open.

- Jonsi Stephenson said a temporary restraining order against him was lifted; remaining legal focus is on solicitation, and he believes his contract has no consequence.

- Jonsi Stephenson said a temporary restraining order that previously limited his ability to take meetings is no longer in place, and the remaining legal focus is on a solicitation-related issue.

- Jonsi Stephenson proposed a 'better together' approach with Microsoft where VAST invests engineering effort into deep integration with Azure Blob, positioning VAST as the high-performance filer and GPU-adjacent storage while Azure Blob remains the object store, enabling a global namespace spanning Azure, Nebius, Nscale, and other GPU cloud providers.

- Jonsi Stephenson stated he was in Orlando and handing over for November 17, then attending Microsoft Ignite from 2025-11-18 to 2025-11-21, then AWS re:Invent from 2025-12-01 to 2025-12-05, and expected Jason Vallery and Jeff Denworth to visit Iceland on 2025-12-08.

- Jason Vallery planned to align with Jonsi Stephenson on travel logistics to enable an in-person working session.

- Jason Vallery planned to establish a weekly or monthly 1:1 cadence with Jonsi Stephenson for coordination on cloud-related work.

- Jonsi Stephenson shared a Google Slides presentation titled "GCP Flow from customer to sales to customer.pptx" with Jason Vallery and granted edit access.

- Jonsi Stephenson left an open comment in 'VAST and Azure Integration.docx' questioning whether cold data tiered to Azure Blob should use VAST object format (not directly readable from Azure Blob) versus native Azure Blob format for direct readability and ecosystem accessibility.

- Jonsi Stephenson left an open comment in 'VAST and Azure Integration.docx' asking whether the document should make a firmer statement that VAST DRR/efficiencies reduce the impact of flash supply constraints and rising prices.

- Jonsi Stephenson is GM of Cloud at VAST Data.

- Jonsi Stephenson met with Microsoft contacts Aung (last name unknown) and Maneesh Sah who expect an Azure Blob integration proposal from VAST.

- Jonsi Stephenson emailed Microsoft contacts for MAI supply chain clarity but received out-of-office replies indicating return on 2026-01-05.

- Jonsi Stefansson (jonsi@vastdata.com) shared a Google Slides presentation titled "GCP Flow from customer to sales to customer.pptx" and invited Jason Vallery to edit it.

- Jonsi Stefansson raised a concern that tiering cold data to Azure Blob using VAST object format would not be readable directly from Azure Blob, and suggested reconsidering native Azure Blob format for ecosystem accessibility.

- Jonsi Stefansson suggested strengthening the document's messaging to more firmly state that VAST data reduction ratio (DRR) and efficiencies reduce the impact of flash supply constraints and rising prices.

## Key Decisions

- Use VAST Data real-workload TPU benchmark results and the cross-region global namespace demo as primary evidence in upcoming Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) leadership discussions.

- Prioritize the Azure Storage hardware path (running VAST Data on Azure Storage hardware) over Azure LSVx VMs for large-scale GPU and exabyte-scale throughput requirements.

- Treat Microsoft Azure as a distinct sell-to motion (first-party or Azure Storage hardware aligned) separate from Marketplace sell-through, while still making Marketplace listing a near-term priority.

- Use real-workload benchmarks rather than synthetic benchmarks as the standard for TPU and storage evaluations with Google.

- Position the Microsoft partnership narrative as Azure Blob for central data lakes and VAST Data for GPU-adjacent storage, enabled by deep integration with Azure Blob, and avoid expanding into higher-level database or event-broker topics in Microsoft conversations.

- Proceed with drafting and starting the deep Azure Blob integration project rather than waiting for a Microsoft purchase order, to demonstrate commitment and be ready for MAI and OpenAI needs.

- Jonsi Stephenson will proceed with scheduled 1:1 meetings now that the temporary restraining order is lifted.

- Jason Vallery and Jonsi Stephenson will position a potential Microsoft partnership narrative around tighter VAST integration with Azure Blob, with VAST focusing on high-performance file and GPU-adjacent storage rather than being the primary object store.
