## Key Facts

- John owns alliances/partnerships for conventional channels (incl. AMD/NVIDIA) and control-plane partner ecosystem for Tier-2 cloud-in-a-box.
- Morty owns Neo cloud feature requirements; moving to Jason’s team but must keep Neo focus.
- Customer Success under Rob is effectively reactive support, not proactive CS.
- SE org is critical to Jason’s success; Hari called out as a top SE.
- China posture agreed: software-only sales outpost; avoid CAPEX/headcount build-out.
- Need a crisp, quantified Azure Storage gaps narrative ('dagger' slide) and a repeatable measurement rubric across clouds.
- Win/loss analysis should be routine and tied to Sales Ops; cloud is a platform, product gaps apply across deployment environments.
- Confluence is the engineering-respected source of truth for FRDs/requirements; coordinate taxonomy with Alon (A.L.) and Tomer.
- Targets reviewed included Thinking Machines, Reflection, Physical Intelligence, Midjourney, SSI (Safe Superintelligence Inc.), Perplexity, Cohere, Magic, Anthropic, and Apple.
- Reflection is reportedly discussing ~10,000 GB300s for an upcoming run.

## Topics Discussed

Org chart and key leaders across marketing, alliances, SE, sales, finance, Multi-cloud strategy mandate (Azure/AWS/GCP/Oracle) and complement vs compete framing, Cloud packaging and serverless/pipelines gaps, Neo cloud requirements ownership and team transition, Customer Success vs support operating model, SE engagement strategy and Tech Summit embedding, China go-to-market posture (software-only), Azure Storage limitations and messaging for Microsoft, Google RFP triage and no-bid criteria for block/latency-heavy asks, Confluence as FRD system of record and documentation taxonomy, Win/loss cadence and product MBR rhythm, Warm intro mapping via LinkedIn mutuals, Investor vectors for introductions, NVIDIA relationship strategy (events vs 1:1 intros), Outreach messaging strategy (pipeline components vs platform narrative)

## Profile

**Role**: CoreWeave
**Relationship**: External connector

**Background**:
- Former Microsoft colleague of Jason Vallery; potential connector for intros to Phil (Cohere) and Eric (Magic).

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Carl to move to ProServe under Rob.
- ✅ FRDs and detailed customer requirements will be authored/maintained in Confluence.
- ✅ Jason will own multi-cloud strategy end-to-end and catalog in-flight opportunities from a product requirements lens.
- ✅ Establish a monthly touchpoint between Jason and Brandon.
- ✅ Reframe outreach to focus on concrete pipeline components (Kafka for RL, real-time vector DB) rather than platform narratives.
- ✅ Use an NVIDIA-customer event (via AI Circle) as the primary NVIDIA intro mechanism; direct 1:1 intros from NVIDIA reps are unlikely.
- ✅ Broaden persona targeting to include data/pipeline owners, not just CTO-level contacts.
- ✅ Defer direct Google/Microsoft-introduced paths where conflicts exist to reduce hyperscaler conflict risk.
