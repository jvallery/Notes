## Key Facts

- MAI Falcon plan includes Phoenix, Dallas, and Richmond sites (~40k GPUs per site) connected by an AI WAN; initial tranche includes ~3 EB of Blob.
- MAI struggles to use Falcon capacity due to control plane fragility and GPU issues.
- OpenAI GPT-4.5 training reportedly took ~9 months across multi-islands and up to ~100k H100s; outcome described as disappointing, shifting away from ever-bigger clusters.
- MAI is exploring online RL continuous learning loops with ~60s feedback cycles (trainers in Phoenix, generators elsewhere).
- Vipin values VAST features (global namespace, quotas, capacity estimation, QoS) and acknowledges Blob cannot match VAST performance.
- Marketplace VM offers (Lsv4/v5) are not price-performance competitive for VAST at scale; hardware qualification is viewed as the long-term path.
- Azure Hardware qualification for first-party SKUs is a multi-year effort; liquid-cooled storage SKUs could help with data center cooling fungibility and late-binding storage vs GPU rack decisions.
- Blob API is largely Microsoft-specific; S3 compatibility is broadly attractive; multi-protocol (Blob + S3) could broaden appeal but faces Azure control plane integration hurdles.
- Azure LSV4 is a poor fit for VAST (too many cores, weak networking, low NVMe density) leading to poor cost/perf and sticker shock.
- LSV5 is committed by Egal’s team but roughly a year+ out; networking plans may still be insufficient for UK Met Office economics.

## Topics Discussed

Microsoft AI (MAI) org landscape and stakeholders, Falcon capacity rollout and AI WAN, MAI control plane fragility and GPU utilization constraints, Project Apollo (AKS-led slim control plane) and storage integration, Azure internal politics (Compute vs Storage incentives), Azure hardware qualification path and timelines, Liquid-cooled storage SKUs and data center cooling fungibility, Blob API vs S3 compatibility and multi-protocol strategy, Using MAI success as a wedge for broader Azure adoption, MAI as marquee win to drive Azure hardware alignment, UK Met Office opportunity and LSV5 networking economics, Azure LSV4/LSV5 VM shape limitations for VAST, Comparative economics deck (VAST vs Blob; on-prem vs Azure), Azure Marketplace offer progress and limitations, Neo clouds and GPU-adjacent storage for network disconnect resilience

## Profile

**Role**: Microsoft
**Relationship**: Partner/customer-side contact (MAI within Microsoft ecosystem)

**Background**:
- MAI (ex-Inflection) contact; described as a strong VAST proponent; Koncha previously worked with him during Inflection.
- MAI-aligned; described as a strong VAST proponent; to be re-engaged to reopen MAI conversation and align with Kushal.

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Wait until Friday’s Kushal meeting before Alon follows up with Vipin.
- ✅ Prioritize Project Apollo as the first entry path over Azure marketplace SKUs.
- ✅ Use MAI success as the wedge to influence broader Azure storage strategy and hardware qualification.
- ✅ Treat Blob compatibility as exploratory; near-term emphasis remains on performance to keep GPUs utilized.
- ✅ Focus first on MAI and UK Met Office to create executive pull for a VAST-suitable Azure hardware shape.
- ✅ Pursue a dual track: ship marketplace offers while driving a leadership-backed hardware path.
- ✅ Defer broad sales pushes until a credible Azure product/SKU path exists.
- ✅ Near-term focus on MAI and UK Met Office over broad sales motion.
- ✅ Pursue a dual-track: marketplace listing plus flagship customer escalations.
- ✅ Use Nidhi to re-energize internal advocacy once the story and offer are ready.
