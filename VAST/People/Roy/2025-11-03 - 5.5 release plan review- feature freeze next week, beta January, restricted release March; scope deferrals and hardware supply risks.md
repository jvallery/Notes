# 5.5 release plan review: feature freeze next week, beta January, restricted release March; scope deferrals and hardware supply risks

**Date**: 2025-11-03
**Project**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Roy, Erwin, Asaf Levy, Yogev Shachar, Thomas, Dan, Shachar, Yaakov, Shelly, Sherry, Jeff Denworth, Gregor, Tzu

## Summary

Internal team reviewed the updated VAST 5.5 release plan with feature freeze the week of 2025-11-10, beta in January 2026, and restricted release in March 2026, including discussion of the typical restricted-to-GA gap (target ~5-6 weeks). The group emphasized technical debt and resilience work (NDU latency, install fixes, support bundles, metrics scaling, testability) and confirmed several scope decisions (Azure GA in 5.5, Query Engine DDL in 5.5, multiple items deferred to 5.6). Hardware change management and supply risk (NICs and drives) drove actions around risk buys, alternate sourcing, and a Broadcom 4.2 evaluation justification.


## Action Items

- [?] Submit risk buys for SSDs (E1L, SCM, UW2FMLK) to secure December QA quantities and lock forecast. @Shelly 📅 2025-11-04 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Ensure alternate drive sources by securing three SCM vendors and three 122 U.2 vendors to mitigate supply and price risk. @Shelly 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Send clarified GMP POC document to stakeholders, explicitly stating what is in VAST Data 5.5 vs VAST Data 5.6 and the associated risks. @Roy 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Review HTX readiness for an early-December dark-site production install, align with the NFSv4 event triggers December beta, and adjust the plan if needed. @TBD 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Update the FRD for AVMS scaling if tests exceed 100,000 views. @TBD 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Decide on MD Migrate rollout strategy for VAST Data 5.5 (general availability vs limited customers) and ensure disable and rollback safety. @Jeff Denworth 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm readiness or deferral for the firmware item that requires a new procedure for VAST Data 5.5. @TBD 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Revisit the restricted-release to GA timeline for VAST Data 5.5 and confirm the plan, targeting approximately 5-6 weeks. @Roy 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Discuss Broadcom 4.2 path and NVIDIA CX7 supply exposure and agree on mitigation actions. @Shelly 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Clarify the value of Query Engine DDL in VAST Data 5.5 and document the roadmap for aggregations (group-by, sum, count). @TBD 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm g-node and Genoa acceleration demo readiness plan for NVIDIA GTC in March 2026, including milestones and owners. @Yaakov 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Validate sample quantities and QA timelines for all listed SSDs and adjust risk buys if needed. @Shelly 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- VAST Data 5.5 includes Azure GA as part of the 5.5 release scope.

- Cloud decommission functionality is delivered in VAST Data 5.5 for cloud flows.

- Query Engine DDL is included in VAST Data 5.5; Query Engine group-by aggregations are not included in 5.5.

- SMB scale is deferred from VAST Data 5.5 to VAST Data 5.6.

- SPDK target is moved from VAST Data 5.5 to VAST Data 5.6.

- DB projections are moved from VAST Data 5.5 to VAST Data 5.6.

- NFSv4 delegations view-level is added in VAST Data 5.5.

- Physical quota is added in VAST Data 5.5.

- SMB server-side copy (SMBX copy) is added in VAST Data 5.5.

- Broadcom 4.2 is not currently in VAST Data 5.5 scope and requires a separate justification to evaluate.




## Key Information


- VAST Data 5.5 release plan timeline discussed: feature freeze planned for the week of 2025-11-10, beta release planned for January 2026, and restricted release planned for March 2026.

- Team debated the typical restricted-release to GA duration for a minor release and aligned that it is usually about 5-6 weeks (not 3 months).

- VAST Data 5.5 prioritizes technical debt and resilience improvements including NDU latency improvements, installation fixes, support bundle enhancements, metrics scaling, and improved qualification and testability in AVMS.

- Asaf Levy performed field research and the platform/control area added multiple fixes and features into VAST Data 5.5 based on issues observed in the field.

- Customer-facing items discussed for VAST Data 5.5 include 'old snapshots' (a secondary access point to independently taken snapshots) and a delta cache feature.

- Software-defined e-box enablement direction is to reduce code changes by moving toward configuration-based enablement in VAST Data 5.6; 5.5 work aims to avoid VMS/platform code changes when adding new e-box types where possible.

- Cloud scope for VAST Data 5.5 includes Azure GA; AWS and GCP have minor releases without decommission, while decommission is delivered in 5.5 for cloud flows.

- Query Engine scope for VAST Data 5.5 includes DDL support, but group-by aggregations are not included; focus remains on performance.

- SMB scale, SPDK target, and DB projections were moved out of VAST Data 5.5 and deferred to VAST Data 5.6.

- MD Migrate was flagged as risky for a minor release (VAST Data 5.5) and the team considered limiting enablement to specific customers and ensuring disable and rollback safety.

- NFSv4 event triggers for HTX were discussed as targeting a December beta, and an early-December dark-site production install was flagged as a readiness risk.

- Hardware change management risks for VAST Data 5.5 include firmware updates (one item requires a new procedure not yet ready), unfinalized BOMs, and supply constraints and cost pressure on NICs and drives, requiring risk buys and alternate sourcing.
