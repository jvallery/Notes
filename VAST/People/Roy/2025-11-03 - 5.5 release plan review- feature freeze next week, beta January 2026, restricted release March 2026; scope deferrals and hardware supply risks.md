# 5.5 release plan review: feature freeze next week, beta January 2026, restricted release March 2026; scope deferrals and hardware supply risks

**Date**: 2025-11-03
**Project**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Roy, Erwin Trogler, Asaf Levy, Yogev Shachar, Thomas, Dan Murray, Shachar, Yaakov, Shelly, Sherry, Jeff Denworth, Gregor, Tzu

## Summary

The team reviewed the updated VAST 5.5 release plan with feature freeze targeted for the week of 2025-11-10, beta targeted for January 2026, and restricted release targeted for March 2026, with debate on the typical restricted-to-GA gap (generally 5-6 weeks). Discussion emphasized technical debt and resilience work (NDU latency, install fixes, support bundles, metrics scaling, testability), clarified several 5.5 scope decisions (Query Engine DDL in, group-by out; multiple items deferred to 5.6), and covered hardware change management and supply risks (NICs and drives) requiring risk buys and alternate sourcing.


## Action Items

- [?] Check and add SMI 3.2 SCM line item to the VAST Data 5.5 sampling and QA plan and confirm required quantities. @Shelly 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Submit risk buys for SSDs (E1L, SCM, UW2FMLK) to secure December 2025 QA quantities and lock the forecast. @Shelly 📅 2025-11-04 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Ensure alternate drive sources by securing three SCM vendors and three 122 U.2 vendors to mitigate price and supply risk for VAST Data 5.5 hardware qualification. @Shelly 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Compile a list of VAST Data 5.5 beta customers and the specific features they will validate (beyond HTX) for the next 1-2 months. @Roy 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Send a clarified GMP POC document to stakeholders that explicitly distinguishes 5.5 scope vs 5.6 scope and calls out risks. @Roy 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Review HTX readiness for an early-December 2025 dark-site production install, align timing with the NFSv4 event triggers beta, and adjust the plan if needed. @TBD 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Update the FRD for AVMS scaling to address scenarios where tests exceed 100,000 views. @TBD 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Decide the MD Migrate rollout strategy for VAST Data 5.5 (general availability vs limited customers) and ensure disable and rollback safety is designed and validated. @Jeff Denworth 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm readiness or deferral for the firmware update item that requires a new procedure that is not yet ready, and align it to VAST Data 5.5 scope. @TBD 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Revisit and confirm the restricted-release to GA timeline plan for VAST Data 5.5, targeting approximately 5-6 weeks unless validation constraints require change. @Roy 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Discuss the Broadcom 4.2 path and quantify NVIDIA CX7 NIC supply exposure, then agree on mitigation actions. @Shelly 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Clarify the concrete value of Query Engine DDL in VAST Data 5.5 and document the roadmap for aggregations (group-by, sum, count). @TBD 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm the g-node and Genoa acceleration demo readiness plan for NVIDIA GTC in March 2026, including milestones and owners. @Yaakov 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Validate sample quantities and QA timelines for all listed SSDs and adjust risk buys if needed to protect December 2025 QA schedules. @Shelly 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- VAST Data 5.5 includes Azure GA as part of the 5.5 release scope.

- Cloud decommission functionality is delivered in VAST Data 5.5 for cloud flows.

- Query Engine DDL is included in VAST Data 5.5.

- Query Engine group-by aggregations are not included in VAST Data 5.5.

- SMB scale is deferred from VAST Data 5.5 to VAST Data 5.6.

- SPDK target work is moved from VAST Data 5.5 to VAST Data 5.6.

- Database projections are moved from VAST Data 5.5 to VAST Data 5.6.

- NFSv4 delegations view-level is added in VAST Data 5.5.

- Physical quota is added in VAST Data 5.5.

- SMB server-side copy (SMBX copy) is added in VAST Data 5.5.

- Broadcom 4.2 is not currently in VAST Data 5.5 scope and requires a separate justification to evaluate.




## Key Information


- VAST Data release 5.5 plan targets feature freeze during the week of 2025-11-10, beta in January 2026, and restricted release in March 2026.

- The team stated the typical restricted-release to GA gap for VAST minor releases is about 5-6 weeks, and debated whether 5.5 should follow that cadence.

- VAST Data 5.5 prioritizes technical debt and resilience improvements including NDU latency improvements, installation fixes, and expanded support bundle capabilities requested by Support and customers.

- VAST Data 5.5 includes metrics scaling work and improved e-box qualification and testability work in AVMS/VMS areas.

- Asaf Levy performed field research that drove several platform and control fixes/features included in VAST Data 5.5.

- The 'old snapshots' feature discussed for VAST Data 5.5 was described as a secondary access point to snapshots taken independently, not merely hiding snapshots from view.

- Software-defined e-box enablement goal is to add new e-box hardware without requiring VMS or platform code changes, with a further move toward config-file based enablement planned for VAST Data 5.6.

- Non-standard e-box hardware qualification time varies based on deviation size; examples referenced included CloudStrike and Tesla in VAST Data 5.4, with larger changes (e.g., TCP instead of RDMA) taking longer.

- Cloud scope for VAST Data 5.5 includes Azure GA, while AWS and GCP have minor releases without decommission; decommission is delivered in 5.5 for cloud flows.

- Query Engine scope for VAST Data 5.5 includes DDL support, while group-by aggregations are not included in 5.5 and performance is the focus.

- SMB scale, SPDK target work, and database projections were explicitly moved out of VAST Data 5.5 and deferred to VAST Data 5.6.

- MD Migrate was flagged as risky for a minor release (VAST Data 5.5) and may require a limited customer rollout with disable and rollback safety.

- NFSv4 event triggers for HTX were discussed as targeting a December 2025 beta, with concern about readiness for an early-December dark-site production install.

- Hardware change management for VAST Data 5.5 includes firmware updates, BOM finalization, sample quantity planning, and risk buys to secure December 2025 QA quantities; supply risk exists for NICs (NVIDIA CX7) and drives (SCM and 122 U.2).
