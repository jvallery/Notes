# Weekly SE community call

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**With**: JB, Rob, Dre, Stacy, Jeff Moeller, Andrew Stack, Andy, Tim, Paul, Parker, Travis

## Summary

Weekly SE community call focused on end-of-quarter push, Tech Summit logistics (agenda email, hotel confirmations, evening events), and driving UserCon registrations for already-sold tickets. A strict expense policy was reiterated (no reimbursement outside official events). Jeff Moeller introduced the SE Toolbox segment with a demo of his Port Mapper tool for switch port mapping, config generation, and planning/validation workflows.

## Decisions
- Introduce an SE Toolbox segment approximately monthly.
- Tech Summit evening events set: Day 1 reception, Day 2 OPA tavern, Day 3 Sportsplex gaming event with prizes.
- Enforce strict no-expense policy outside official Tech Summit events.
- SEs are responsible for driving UserCon attendance by working with AEs and customers to convert sold tickets into registrations.

## Key Information
- SE community size is ~175; ~50 attended the call.
- Tech Summit is in two weeks from the meeting date.
- UserCon status: 19 registered; ~40 tickets sold; ~100 more tickets expected to close in the next few days.
- A dashboard will be shared to show ticket sales/registrations by account.
- Expense policy: no reimbursement for spend outside official Tech Summit events.
- SE Toolbox launched; first session featured Jeff Moeller’s Port Mapper (Python GUI) for switch port mapping, config generation, Lucidchart overlays, JSON import/export, and per-rack bandwidth validation.
- Port Mapper supports NVIDIA/Mellanox, Cisco, and Arista; handles Cisco ASIC slice balancing and Arista physical port order; no IPv6 support yet.
- Switch config generation depends on VPN to pull latest switchconf; offline requires manual steps.
- Guidance: do not plug clients into southbound switches; use networking field request process for design help.
