# 1:1 with Shachar Feinblit, weekly cadence and Tel Aviv visit planning (Nov 23-26, 2025)

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**With**: Jason Vallery, Shachar Feinblit

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Shachar Feinblit agreed to establish a weekly 30-minute 1:1 and planned Jason’s Tel Aviv visit (2025-11-23 to 2025-11-26) to meet key teams and run cloud platform knowledge sharing plus architecture/design planning. Shachar outlined key contacts across UX, release management, cloud engineering, support, and solutions, and discussed strengthening product’s technical depth because architects currently author detailed FRDs.

## Decisions


- Establish a weekly 30-minute 1:1 sync between Jason Vallery and Shachar Feinblit.

- Proceed with Jason Vallery’s Tel Aviv visit on 2025-11-23 to 2025-11-26 with an agenda focused on cloud platform knowledge sharing and cloud architecture and design planning.




## Key Information


- Shachar Feinblit prefers meetings very late in the day only when they are customer-related, but will accept a weekly 30-minute internal sync if Jason Vallery finds an available slot due to calendar constraints.

- Jason Vallery planned a Tel Aviv visit from 2025-11-23 to 2025-11-26 to meet VAST Data teams, share cloud platform experience (including Azure and cloud platform operations), and run cloud architecture and design planning sessions.

- Shachar Feinblit stated that much of the work to make VAST Data Cloud successful sits with Shachar’s team, while Yancey’s team owns control plane and marketplace work.

- Shachar Feinblit identified key cloud engineering leadership as Ronnie and Max, leading two teams split between VM-focused work and platform-aspects work.

- Shachar Feinblit described release management coordination: Noah and Yael Treitel arrange release management and tactical selection, Roit Suhr manages the 5.5 release execution, and Orly manages 5.4 and will move to 5.6.

- Shachar Feinblit recommended Jason Vallery meet Liron from the UX team, Omri from Support, and the Solutions team leads Ronen (team lead) and Dotan (cloud with Intel focus).

- Shachar Feinblit suggested Jason Vallery meet the QA lead for cloud, but the QA lead’s name was not captured in the transcript.

- Shachar Feinblit runs a monthly team all-hands and said he may move it to the week of 2025-11-23 so Jason Vallery can introduce himself in person during the Tel Aviv visit.

- Shachar Feinblit asked whether Jason Vallery met Alon Horev, and Jason confirmed he has an active working relationship with Alon Horev and is leveraging Alon’s existing knowledge.

- Shachar Feinblit raised Mordecai as a person Jason Vallery should meet; additional context about Mordecai’s role and potential team move was referenced in the notes but not fully present in the visible transcript segment.
