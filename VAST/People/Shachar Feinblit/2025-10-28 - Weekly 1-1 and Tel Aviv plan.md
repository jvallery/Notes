# Weekly 1:1 and Tel Aviv plan

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Forum**: [[Shachar Feinblit]]
**Attendees**: Jason Vallery, Shachar Feinblit

## Summary

Jason and Shachar agreed to establish a weekly 30-minute 1:1 and planned Jason’s Tel Aviv visit (2025-11-23 to 2025-11-26) to meet key teams, share cloud platform knowledge, and run cloud architecture/design planning sessions. They discussed AI/automation usage (e.g., Cursor; previously Copilot; evaluating Windsurf) and the tradeoffs of a formal AI center of excellence versus organic innovation. Shachar emphasized the need to strengthen product’s technical depth and end-to-end involvement, noting architects currently write detailed FRDs.

- Release coordination: Noah and Yael Treitel coordinate; Roit Suhr manages 5.5; Orly manages 5.4 and will move to 5.6.
- UX contact: Liron. Support contact: Omri. Solutions: Ronen leads; Dotan focuses on cloud with Intel.
- Shachar’s org uses AI tools (Cursor; previously Copilot; evaluating Windsurf) mainly for analysis, CI optimization, and bug triage.
- Feature planning buckets: tactical deal-driven, strategic innovation, and technical debt.
- Architects currently author detailed FRDs; product technical depth and end-to-end involvement need strengthening.
- Mordechai Blaunstein is between product/program, less technical, currently reports to Alon; Jeff is considering moving him to a different team.
