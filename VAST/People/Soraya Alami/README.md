## Key Facts

- EY is the near-term priority as a design partner, starting on Azure, with executive alignment planned around Microsoft Ignite.
- VAST has no GA cloud marketplace offer yet; near-term cloud fit is burst-to-cloud and repatriation.
- Work underway on optimized VM shapes and potential bare metal/storage-core integrations to improve cloud economics.
- Accenture is building an opinionated AI/HPC stack that currently includes VAST.
- Deloitte AI Factory lessons: advisory alone is insufficient; need co-developed, productized solutions.
- Referral incentive program is contemplated at ~3% of ACV (licenses only) and is moving through legal.
- Competitive overlap expected with Microsoft AI Foundry; VAST to emphasize data/workflow portability across clouds and on-prem.
- Multiple SIs (TCS, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Infosys) are reorganizing around AI; sales/build misalignment exists.

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Prioritize EY design partnership on Azure to unlock co-development and a portability-led narrative (reversible).
- ✅ Concentrate SI engagement on workflow automation practices to drive repeatable end-to-end solutions (reversible).
- ✅ Treat Kyndryl as an incentive-driven partner rather than a strategic co-development focus; revisit post-workshop.
- ✅ Advance referral incentive program (~3% ACV, licenses only) to enable pay-for-play partners while protecting margin.
