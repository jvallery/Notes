# GSI Team: EY Azure-first design partnership, SI workflow-automation GTM, and cloud readiness gaps

**Date**: 2025-11-07
**Project**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Soraya Alami, Jason Vallery, Jesse Thaloor, John Cedillo

## Summary

The GSI Team aligned on a go-to-market strategy with global SIs centered on enterprise workflow automation and repeatable, productized solutions rather than infrastructure outsourcing. EY is the near-term priority as an Azure-first design partner with executive alignment targeted around Microsoft Ignite, while VAST’s current cloud posture (no GA marketplace offer yet) drives a near-term focus on burst-to-cloud and repatriation plus work on optimized VM shapes and potential bare metal to improve economics.

## Decisions


- Prioritize an EY design-partner relationship with an Azure-first motion to unlock co-development and a portability-led narrative, with executive alignment targeted around Microsoft Ignite.

- Concentrate SI engagement on workflow automation business units and practices to drive repeatable end-to-end solutions rather than infrastructure outsourcing motions.

- Treat Kyndryl as an incentive-driven partner rather than a strategic co-development focus, and revisit prioritization after the initial virtual workshop.

- Advance a partner referral incentive program at approximately 3% of ACV (licenses only) to enable pay-for-play partners while protecting margin.




## Key Information


- The GSI Team agreed to prioritize EY as a near-term design partner with an Azure-first motion and executive alignment targeted around Microsoft Ignite.

- VAST Data does not yet have a GA cloud marketplace offer; the near-term cloud fit is burst-to-cloud and repatriation use cases.

- VAST Data is exploring optimized cloud VM shapes and potential bare-metal or storage-core integrations to improve cloud economics and TCO.

- Accenture is building an opinionated AI/HPC stack and VAST Data is currently included in that stack.

- Deloitte AI Factory experience highlighted that advisory-only engagements are insufficient; SI motions need co-developed, productized delivery to drive adoption.

- A partner referral incentive program is being advanced at approximately 3% of ACV for licenses only and is moving through legal approval.

- The team expects competitive overlap with Microsoft AI Foundry in Azure-centric accounts and plans to emphasize VAST Data’s data and workflow portability across clouds and on-premises.

- Kyndryl will be engaged via an initial virtual workshop and treated as an incentive-led, non-strategic partner unless post-workshop traction warrants escalation.

- Multiple SIs including TCS, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, and Infosys are reorganizing around AI, and there is misalignment between sales and build/delivery organizations that can slow solution adoption.
