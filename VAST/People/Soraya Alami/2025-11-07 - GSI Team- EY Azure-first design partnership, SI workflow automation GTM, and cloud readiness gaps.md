# GSI Team: EY Azure-first design partnership, SI workflow automation GTM, and cloud readiness gaps

**Date**: 2025-11-07
**Project**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Soraya Alami, Jason Vallery, Jesse Thaloor, John Cedillo

## Summary

The GSI Team aligned on a go-to-market strategy with global SIs centered on enterprise workflow automation and repeatable, productized solutions. EY is the near-term priority as an Azure-first design partner with executive alignment targeted around Microsoft Ignite, while VAST positions portability across clouds and on-prem and addresses cloud economics gaps (no GA marketplace offer yet, exploring optimized VM shapes and potential bare metal).

## Decisions


- Prioritize an EY design-partner relationship with an Azure-first motion to unlock co-development and a portability-led narrative, with the option to reverse as the partner landscape evolves.

- Concentrate SI engagement on workflow automation business units and practices (not infrastructure outsourcing) to drive repeatable end-to-end solutions, with the option to reverse if traction is poor.

- Treat Kyndryl as an incentive-driven partner rather than a strategic co-development focus, and revisit after the initial workshop.

- Advance a partner referral incentive program at approximately 3% of ACV (licenses only) to enable pay-for-play partners while protecting margin.




## Key Information


- The GSI Team agreed to prioritize EY as a design partner, starting with an Azure-first motion, with executive alignment targeted around Microsoft Ignite.

- VAST Data does not yet have a GA cloud marketplace offer; the near-term cloud fit is burst-to-cloud and repatriation use cases.

- VAST Data is exploring optimized cloud VM shapes and potential bare-metal or storage-core integrations to improve cloud economics and TCO.

- Accenture is building an opinionated AI/HPC stack and VAST Data is currently included in that stack.

- Deloitte's AI Factory experience indicated advisory-only engagements are insufficient; SI solutions need co-developed, productized delivery to drive adoption.

- A partner referral incentive program is being advanced at approximately 3% of ACV (licenses only) and is moving through legal approvals.

- The team expects competitive overlap with Microsoft AI Foundry in Azure-centric accounts and plans to emphasize VAST Data's data and workflow portability across clouds and on-prem.

- Kyndryl will be engaged via an initial virtual workshop and treated as an incentive-led, non-strategic partner pending post-workshop reassessment.

- Multiple global SIs (TCS, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Infosys) are reorganizing around AI, and there is misalignment between SI sales and build/delivery organizations that can block adoption.
