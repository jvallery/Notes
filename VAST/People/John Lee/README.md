## Key Facts

- VAST signed a ~$1.2B software licensing deal with CoreWeave.
- Apollo leadership requested (1) a VAST POC on VAST hardware shipped to an Azure data center and (2) a POC to run VAST bare metal on Azure Storage hardware.
- Azure Storage hardware spec options include Fungible DPU or NVIDIA BlueField 3; Fungible maturity is a risk with no production storage tenants using it yet.
- MAI is Apollo’s first customer; long-term Apollo vision is multi-tenant, third-party configurable offering.
- MAI Dallas capacity: initial tranche in December and larger tranche in April; April storage plan is still fluid and Kushal is interested in VAST.
- To support MAI Dallas on classic Azure (not Apollo), VAST would need to run bare metal on Azure Storage hardware and interoperate with Overlake/SDN.
- UK Met Office is exploring a POC with VAST hardware in an Azure Canary region.
- NVIDIA DGX Cloud storage requires aggressive per-GPU throughput; VAST and Weka are qualified; Azure Storage currently does not meet these specs.
- DGX Cloud on Azure uses AMLFS for H100/A100; no GB-series storage benchmarking observed by Kanchan.
- Deploying VAST on Lsv4/Lsv5 compute SKUs is power/capex prohibitive at exabyte scale; co-engineered bare metal on Azure Storage hardware is needed.

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Jason will not contact Michael Myrah directly to avoid premature escalation; Kanchan will open that thread when appropriate.
- ✅ Primary path is through Azure Storage hardware (Michael Myrah) for a single unified story; Azure Dedicated (Anand) is a parallel option if needed.
- ✅ Prioritize a storage-hardware path (Azure Storage Hardware / Michael Myrah’s team) over VM-based approaches for VAST performance and scale.
- ✅ Use MAI-driven demand (via Kushal) to advance the Dallas April window for a VAST bare-metal option.
- ✅ Position NVIDIA DGX reference storage compliance as strategic justification in executive conversations.
- ✅ Avoid opening a direct thread with Michael Myrah until Nidhi’s support is secured.
- ✅ Pursue a BizDev-led path (Joe Vane/Harish) to secure executive sponsorship (John Tinter) and engage Ronnie Booker’s org, rather than focusing on Nidhi/Manish.
- ✅ Treat the Azure Marketplace VM-based VAST offer as a checkbox while pushing a hardware/OEM storage-dense path for real density wins.
