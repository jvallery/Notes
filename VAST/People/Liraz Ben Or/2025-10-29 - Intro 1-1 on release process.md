# Intro 1:1 on release process

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**With**: Liraz Ben Or, Jason Vallery

## Summary

Jason and Liraz held an intro 1:1 focused on VAST’s non-traditional release management process, including phase gates, QA cycles, overlapping release trains, and field/customer-driven prioritization. Liraz described org structure (core dev vs vForce), key artifacts (wiki, QTest, Gantt/Excel, weekly status decks), and how change management drops or stretches features. They agreed to follow up next week and plan an in-person sync during Jason’s Tel Aviv trip in late November.

## Key Information
- Liraz is Head of Program Management with a team of three and is deeply involved in release management and phase gates.
- Release process is waterfall with four phase gates: (1) scope review, (2) plan & change management, (3) code freeze & beta readiness, (4) release.
- QA runs three cycles per release: Phase 1 (all tests), Phase 2 (re-run failed tests), Golden Run (all tests again); target success rate ~96–97%.
- Release cadence is roughly every five months.
- Org split: core dev focuses on future major releases; vForce handles field releases and escalations; 5.1 is hotfix-only.
- Active trains discussed: 5.4 released last week; 5.5 in progress; 5.6 planning starting; older trains (5.3, 5.2) still maintained.
- Prioritization is strongly field/customer driven; change management is used to drop or stretch features; anchor features get beta customers and early drops.
- Artifacts include per-release wiki pages (status/owners/dates), Gantt (often Excel), QA tracking in QTest, and weekly internal status decks.
- Tesla requirements drove expedited milestones on 5.4.
- Phase Gate 1 for 5.6 was targeted in about two weeks from the meeting date.
