# Liraz Ben Or walked Jason through VAST 4 phase-gate release management (5.4-5.6) and sustaining vForce model

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**With**: Jason Vallery, Liraz Ben Or

## Summary

Liraz Ben Or explained VAST Data's non-traditional major release management using four phase gates (scope, plan/change management, code freeze/beta readiness, release) with overlapping planning and execution across major versions. The discussion covered sustaining support via a separate vForce team for older majors, QA cycle targets, decision-making roles across product, architects, and development leadership, and the need to bring cloud-driven work into the same governed phase-gate and QA process.


## Action Items


- [?] Review VAST Data 5.4 phase-gate decks and materials shared by Liraz Ben Or. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Send VAST Data 5.5 status wiki and Excel Gantt link(s) to Jason Vallery. @Liraz Ben Or 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Review VAST Data 5.5 status wiki and Excel Gantt to understand current execution status and upcoming feature freeze. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule a follow-up 1:1 with Liraz Ben Or next week to go deeper on VAST Data release process details (phase gates, roles, tooling, and governance). @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Asaf Levy on thematic and architectural planning approach for VAST Data releases, including how priorities are shaped beyond single-customer asks. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Plan and schedule an in-person sync with Liraz Ben Or in Tel Aviv during Jason Vallery's trip (2025-11-23 to 2025-11-26). @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Share the current VAST Data 5.5 anchor features and the beta customers enlisted for those anchor features. @Liraz Ben Or 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Ensure cloud-driven features follow VAST Data phase gates and are included in release QA plans (avoid ad hoc cloud releases outside governance). @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm the exact calendar date planned for VAST Data 5.6 Phase Gate 1. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Obtain access to VAST Data per-release wiki pages, QTest views/dashboards, and the weekly release status deck materials. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Connect with the release managers for VAST Data 5.5 and 5.6 (referenced as Orly and Roy) to establish working rhythms and clarify planning vs execution ownership. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Clarify VAST Data official support policy for older major versions (target 'major minus two') and document any exceptions (for example, 5.1 hotfix-only). @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Liraz Ben Or has worked at VAST Data for almost six years (six years in March 2026) and leads program management for major releases with a team of three.

- VAST Data major releases use four phase gates: PG1 scope review, PG2 plan/timeline and change management, PG3 code freeze and beta readiness, PG4 release.

- VAST Data QA runs three cycles for a release: Phase 1 runs all tests, Phase 2 reruns failed tests only, and a Golden Run reruns all tests, targeting 96-97% success.

- VAST Data release cadence is roughly every five months, and planning for the next major overlaps with code freeze of the current major.

- VAST Data released version 5.4 in the week prior to 2025-10-29; 5.5 is in execution toward feature freeze; 5.6 Phase Gate 1 was expected in approximately two weeks from 2025-10-29.

- VAST Data uses a sustaining organization called vForce to handle minors and hotfixes for older major versions; the intent is to maintain 'major minus two' but customers still run 5.1 in the field, which receives hotfixes only.

- Unplanned VAST Data 5.2 minor releases were shipped to fix upgrade issues; the current migration focus is moving customers to 5.3 because 5.4 was described as not yet stable enough for broad push.

- VAST Data splits release management responsibilities so release managers focus on planning while Liraz Ben Or's team focuses on execution; release managers for 5.5 and 5.6 were referenced as Orly and Roy.

- Decision roles for VAST Data releases were described as: product management (example: Tomer Hagay) sources customer needs, architects (example: Asaf Levy's team) design, and development leadership (example: Shachar, last name not provided) makes trade-off calls with product.

- VAST Data release tracking tools include per-release wiki status pages, Excel Gantt plans, and QTest for QA, plus weekly internal status reviews using slides.

- Anchor features for a VAST Data major release are used to recruit beta customers, and change management at phase gates can push features to later releases.

- Liraz Ben Or stated cloud components should be integrated into the same phase-gate and QA process as core releases, rather than being released ad hoc outside governance.
