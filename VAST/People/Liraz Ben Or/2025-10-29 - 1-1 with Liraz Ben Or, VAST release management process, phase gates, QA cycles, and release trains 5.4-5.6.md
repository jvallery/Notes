# 1:1 with Liraz Ben Or, VAST release management process, phase gates, QA cycles, and release trains (5.4-5.6)

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**With**: Jason Vallery, Liraz Ben Or

## Summary

Jason Vallery met 1:1 with Liraz Ben Or to understand VAST Data's non-traditional release management approach, including four phase gates, QA cycles, overlapping release trains, and field-driven prioritization. Liraz explained the org split between core development for future major releases and vForce for field releases and escalations, and shared 5.4 materials with plans to follow up and meet in person during Jason's Tel Aviv trip (Nov 23-26).

## Action Items

- [?] Review the shared VAST Data 5.4 phase gate materials and status wiki links provided by Liraz Ben Or. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Send Jason Vallery the VAST Data 5.5 status wiki link and the current Gantt plan links for the 5.5 release train. @Liraz Ben Or 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule a follow-up 1:1 with Liraz Ben Or for the week of 2025-11-03 to go deeper on VAST Data release management process details (phase gates, decision makers, artifacts). @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Plan an in-person sync with Liraz Ben Or in Tel Aviv during Jason Vallery's trip on 2025-11-23 to 2025-11-26. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Connect with Asaf Levy (Architecture) to align a thematic roadmap for cloud-driven features entering the VAST Data core product release trains. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm Jason Vallery has access to QTest and the weekly internal VAST Data release status decks used for release execution tracking. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm invitation and attendance for VAST Data release 5.6 Phase Gate 1 meeting (targeted approximately two weeks after 2025-10-29). @Myself 📅 2025-11-12 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Align with Tomer Hagay and Jeff Denworth (and Noah Cohen if applicable) on how customer requests roll into FRDs and PRDs for upcoming VAST Data releases (e.g., 5.6). @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Discuss documenting the VAST Data phase gate process (RACI, required artifacts, and exit criteria) to reduce tribal knowledge risk. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Clarify VAST Data support policy (e.g., 'major minus two') and define explicit end-of-life expectations for older trains such as 5.1 and 5.2. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with VAST Data field teams to identify potential beta customers for 5.5 anchor features that are relevant to cloud initiatives. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

## Key Information

- Liraz Ben Or has worked at VAST Data for almost six years (six years in March 2026).

- Liraz Ben Or is Head of Program Management at VAST Data and leads major release program management with a team of three.

- Liraz Ben Or is deeply involved in release management and is responsible for VAST Data release phase gates (she invites stakeholders to phase gate meetings).

- VAST Data major releases use a waterfall-style process with four phase gates: (1) scope/content review, (2) plan plus change management to adjust commitments, (3) code freeze and beta readiness, and (4) release.

- VAST Data QA runs three cycles per release: Phase 1 runs all tests, Phase 2 re-runs failed tests, and a Golden Run re-runs all tests again; target QA success rate is approximately 96-97%.

- VAST Data release cadence is roughly every five months, with overlapping work where some developers shift to planning the next release during the current release code freeze.

- VAST Data maintains multiple release trains concurrently: 5.4 was released the week prior to 2025-10-29; 5.5 is in progress; 5.6 planning is starting; 5.3 and 5.2 are still maintained; 5.1 is hotfix-only.

- VAST Data is releasing additional 5.2 minors (e.g., 5.2.4) due to field upgrade issues requiring fixes, despite not planning to continue 5.2 minors originally.

- VAST Data has customers still running 5.1 in the field; 5.1 receives only hotfixes and no regular minor releases.

- VAST Data aims for a 'major minus two' support posture, but customers often remain on older versions because upgrades are difficult; the organization provides hotfixes when needed.

- VAST Data's R&D organization split includes core development for future major releases and a separate vForce group responsible for field releases and escalations; developers may rotate between groups, and vForce work is high-stress with after-hours escalation expectations.

- VAST Data prioritization is strongly field and customer driven; product curates a customer-weighted feature list for upcoming releases, and change management is used to drop or stretch features when commitments cannot be met.

- VAST Data release artifacts include per-release wiki pages (status, owners, dates), Gantt plans (often in Excel), QA tracking in QTest, and weekly internal status decks.

- VAST Data pushed expedited milestones in release 5.4 due to Tesla requirements.

- Liraz Ben Or stated that 5.4 was not yet stable enough at the time of the meeting and the organization was primarily pushing customers to 5.3 until 5.4 stabilizes.
