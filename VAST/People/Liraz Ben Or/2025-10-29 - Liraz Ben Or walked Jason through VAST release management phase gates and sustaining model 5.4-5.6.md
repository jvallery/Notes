# Liraz Ben Or walked Jason through VAST release management phase gates and sustaining model (5.4-5.6)

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**With**: Jason Vallery, Liraz Ben Or

## Summary

Liraz Ben Or explained VAST Data's non-traditional major release management process, including four phase gates, overlapping planning and execution across majors, and a sustaining vForce team for older versions. They reviewed current release state (5.4 just released, 5.5 executing, 5.6 entering early planning), QA cycle targets, decision roles across product, architects, and development leadership, and the need to bring cloud work into the same gated process.


## Action Items


- [?] Review the VAST Data 5.4 phase-gate decks and materials shared by Liraz Ben Or. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Send the VAST Data 5.5 status wiki link(s) and Excel Gantt link(s) to Jason Vallery. @Liraz Ben Or 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Review the VAST Data 5.5 status wiki and Excel Gantt to understand current execution status and upcoming feature freeze readiness. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule a follow-up 1:1 with Liraz Ben Or for a deeper dive on the VAST Data release process. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Asaf Levy on how VAST Data does thematic and architectural planning and how priorities are shaped beyond single-customer feature asks. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Plan and schedule an in-person sync with Liraz Ben Or in Tel Aviv during 2025-11-23 to 2025-11-26. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Share the current VAST Data 5.5 anchor features and the beta customers enlisted for those anchor features. @Liraz Ben Or 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Ensure cloud-driven features and cloud components follow the VAST Data phase-gate process and are included in the release QA plans rather than being released ad hoc. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm the exact calendar date planned for VAST Data 5.6 Phase Gate 1. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Connect with the release managers for VAST Data 5.5 and 5.6 (examples mentioned: Orly and Roy) to establish working rhythms and clarify planning vs execution ownership. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Clarify the official VAST Data support policy for older major versions (target major minus two) and document any exceptions (for example, continued 5.1 hotfix support). @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Liraz Ben Or has worked at VAST Data for almost six years and is Head of Program Management, responsible for major releases and the phase-gate release meetings.

- VAST Data major releases use four phase gates: PG1 scope review, PG2 plan and timeline plus change management, PG3 code freeze and beta readiness, and PG4 release.

- VAST Data QA for a major release runs three cycles: Phase 1 runs all tests, Phase 2 reruns failed tests only, and a Golden Run reruns all tests, targeting 96-97% success.

- VAST Data release cadence is roughly every five months, and planning for the next major overlaps with code freeze of the current major release.

- VAST Data released version 5.4 in the week prior to 2025-10-29; version 5.5 is in execution toward feature freeze; version 5.6 Phase Gate 1 was expected approximately two weeks after 2025-10-29.

- VAST Data maintains older versions via a sustaining development organization called vForce, which handles minors and hotfixes for versions still in the field after a major release ships.

- VAST Data aims to support major minus two, but customers still run 5.1 in the field; 5.1 receives hotfixes only, not planned minors.

- VAST Data shipped unplanned 5.2 minor releases to address upgrade failures; the current migration focus is moving customers to 5.3 because 5.4 was not yet stable enough at the time of the meeting.

- VAST Data split development into two groups: a major-release development organization focused on future major releases and a separate sustaining vForce group for older versions; developers may rotate between the groups, and sustaining work is high-stress due to escalations and off-hours calls.

- VAST Data uses per-release wiki status pages, Excel Gantt plans, and QTest for QA tracking, plus weekly internal status reviews using slides.

- Release management at VAST Data is split so that release managers typically handle planning while Liraz Ben Or's program management team focuses on execution for the major release.

- Product management (example: Tomer Hagay) sources customer needs and desired features for upcoming releases; architects (example: Asaf Levy's team) design; development leadership (example: Shachar, last name not provided) makes trade-off calls jointly with product.

- VAST Data seeks beta customers for anchor features, and change management during phase gates can push features to later releases if commitments cannot be met.

- Cloud components at VAST Data should be integrated into the same phase-gate and QA process as core releases rather than being released ad hoc outside the gated process.
