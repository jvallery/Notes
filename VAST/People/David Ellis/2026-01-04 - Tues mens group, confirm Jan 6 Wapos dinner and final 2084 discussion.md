## Key Information


- David Ellis planned a final mens group discussion about the book '2084' followed by dinner at Wapos on Tuesday, 2026-01-06 at 6:30pm, contingent on having a quorum.

- David Ellis stated he is taking a hiatus from the mens book club early in 2026 and will reassess what to do going forward after the Jan 6, 2026 meeting.

- Ben Kaiser said he is willing to meet on Jan 6, 2026 at Wapos to finish the AI-related book discussion and wants to stay connected with the group at church.

- Ben Kaiser provided his phone number as (719) 360-9749 for texting about the mens group plans.

- Brandon Dodsworth said he will be coaching a basketball team for the next few months with practices scheduled on Tuesday nights, so he would need to step away from the Tuesday mens group meetings.

- Trent Stickney voted for 'The Immortal Mind' as the next book for the mens group and said Jan 6 works best for him and he is down for Wapos.

- Jason Vallery previously noted (Nov 4, 2025) that his schedule became very busy due to a new job and frequent travel through the end of 2025, but he would attend the mens group if he is in town.
