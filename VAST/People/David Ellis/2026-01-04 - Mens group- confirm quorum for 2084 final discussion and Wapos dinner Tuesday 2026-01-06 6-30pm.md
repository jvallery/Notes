**Date**: 2026-01-04
**With**: David Ellis, Ben Kaiser, Brandon & Priscilla Dodsworth, Trent Stickney, M.A. Weimer, Michael Noreen, Brian Bearly, Nathan Fuller, David P. Melton, Myself

## Summary

David Ellis asked the mens group to confirm attendance for the final discussion of the book "2084" followed by dinner at Wapos on Tuesday, 2026-01-06 at 6:30pm, contingent on having a quorum. Thread includes prior context that David planned to take a hiatus from the book club after the January meetup and that some members have Tuesday conflicts early 2026.


## Action Items


- [?] Reply to David Ellis confirming whether I will attend the mens group final discussion of "2084" and dinner at Wapos on Tuesday, 2026-01-06 at 6:30pm so he can determine if there is a quorum. @Myself 📅 2026-01-06 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Tentative plan to meet Tuesday, 2026-01-06 for Wapos dinner and the final discussion of the book "2084", pending quorum confirmation.




## Key Information


- David Ellis planned a final mens group discussion about the book "2084" followed by dinner at Wapos on Tuesday, 2026-01-06 at 6:30pm, contingent on having a quorum.

- David Ellis stated he would take a hiatus from the mens book club early 2026 and reassess what to do going forward, with no future plans after the January 2026 meetup for now.

- Brandon Dodsworth said he would be coaching a basketball team for the next few months and practices were scheduled on Tuesday nights, making him unavailable for Tuesday night mens group meetings during that period.

- Ben Kaiser shared his phone number as (719) 360-9749 for texting to stay in touch about the mens group.

- Trent Stickney voted for the book "The Immortal Mind" as a candidate for the mens group's next book and said January 6 worked best for him.

- Myself (Jason Vallery) previously said that due to a new job and frequent travel through the end of 2025, attendance at mens group meetings would depend on being in town.
