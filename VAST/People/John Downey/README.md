## Key Facts

- Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) has connected and air-gapped variants; NetApp is the current storage partner in GDC deployments.
- Google issued a US-based RFP to replace NetApp for GDC storage; VAST was invited to respond and the pursuit is competitive/vendor due diligence.
- Google’s emphasis areas: air-gapped support, compliance/attestations (e.g., DISA STIG), ops model (updates, staffing, troubleshooting), multi-tenancy, quotas, encryption, and tags integration.
- Fort Meade on-prem "Gemini as a service" initiative is described as a Q4 commit and a strong candidate for rapid joint validation.
- GDC hardware commonly runs on Dell; deployments may also involve HPE and Cisco.
- VAST recently launched Google Marketplace offers; broader partnership is early-stage.
- There may be ambiguity whether "Leo" is the same person as Lior Genzel; needs clarification.
- Z4M is the next Google storage-serving VM with higher storage and network density; Z3 exists today.
- Z4M targets storage-serving use cases; CPU/RAM may be overprovisioned initially with planned pricing optimization.
- Google is developing a Google Supercomputer (GSC) provisioning interface to optimize co-placement of storage and accelerators and potentially automate partner deployments like VAST.

## Topics Discussed

## Profile

**Role**: Partner manager (high-performance file systems and primary storage) at Google
**Location**: New York (mentioned in transcript context)
**Relationship**: Partner contact (Google)

**Background**:
- Mentioned as Google partner manager relevant to storage partnerships.
- Partner manager covering high-performance file systems and primary storage; prior experience includes EMC and AWS enterprise storage strategy; focused on co-selling and co-innovation with partners like VAST.
- Google partner manager; included as participant.

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Greg Castellucci will run point with Google Federal and coordinate with the corporate GDC team over the next few weeks.
- ✅ Jason Vallery will connect Greg with Google stakeholders and drive RFP content assembly.
- ✅ Alon Horev will conduct a 1:1 with Muninder Singh Sambi on AI, VM shapes, RDMA, and storage/hardware tradeoffs.
- ✅ "Leo" will own the end-to-end RFP response and submissions.
- ✅ Use the Fort Meade on-prem "Gemini as a service" effort as the primary near-term validation path/reference.
- ✅ Include Dell and HPE SKU recommendations and consider Cisco/commodity VM options in proposals.
- ✅ Proceed with local SSD-based Z4M for initial VAST on GCP; evaluate object/HyperDisk tiers later.
- ✅ Coordinate in-person sessions at Supercomputing and include key GCP stakeholders (Ilyas, Dean).
- ✅ Create a shared pros/cons document to re-evaluate VIP/failover options (ILB, alias IP, route-based).
- ✅ Engage Google networking for a follow-up deep dive on RDMA and cross-project connectivity.
