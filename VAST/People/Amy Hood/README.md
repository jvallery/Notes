## Key Facts

- John owns alliances/partnerships for conventional channels (incl. AMD/NVIDIA) and control-plane partner ecosystem for Tier-2 cloud-in-a-box.
- Morty owns Neo cloud feature requirements; moving to Jason’s team but must keep Neo focus.
- Customer Success under Rob is effectively reactive support, not proactive CS.
- SE org is critical to Jason’s success; Hari called out as a top SE.
- China posture agreed: software-only sales outpost; avoid CAPEX/headcount build-out.
- Need a crisp, quantified Azure Storage gaps narrative ('dagger' slide) and a repeatable measurement rubric across clouds.
- Win/loss analysis should be routine and tied to Sales Ops; cloud is a platform, product gaps apply across deployment environments.
- Confluence is the engineering-respected source of truth for FRDs/requirements; coordinate taxonomy with Alon (A.L.) and Tomer.
- Kurt is global pre-sales lead for AI Infra under Zia; his team scores constrained GPU allocations and must approve any allocation of constrained SKUs.
- Kurt’s proposal: GA Azure Extended Zones as network-only plus AKS NodeJoin (ACAS FlexNode) to connect neo/sovereign cloud training sites to Azure for global inference.

## Background

Amy Hood has been with Microsoft since 2002 and became the company's first female CFO in 2013. She leads Microsoft's worldwide finance organization and has played a pivotal role in strategic acquisitions, including LinkedIn, GitHub, and Activision Blizzard. Prior to Microsoft, she worked at Goldman Sachs in investment banking and capital markets. Hood holds a bachelor's degree in economics from Duke University and an MBA from Harvard University. She is also a member of the board of directors at 3M.

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Carl to move to ProServe under Rob.
- ✅ FRDs and detailed customer requirements will be authored/maintained in Confluence.
- ✅ Jason will own multi-cloud strategy end-to-end and catalog in-flight opportunities from a product requirements lens.
- ✅ Establish a monthly touchpoint between Jason and Brandon.
- ✅ Pursue a BizDev-led path (Joe Vane/Harish) to secure executive sponsorship (John Tinter) and engage Ronnie Booker’s org, rather than focusing on Nidhi/Manish.
- ✅ Treat the Azure Marketplace VM-based VAST offer as a checkbox while pushing a hardware/OEM storage-dense path for real density wins.
- ✅ Reframe outreach to focus on concrete pipeline components (Kafka for RL, real-time vector DB) rather than platform narratives.
- ✅ Use an NVIDIA-customer event (via AI Circle) as the primary NVIDIA intro mechanism; direct 1:1 intros from NVIDIA reps are unlikely.
- ✅ Broaden persona targeting to include data/pipeline owners, not just CTO-level contacts.
- ✅ Defer direct Google/Microsoft-introduced paths where conflicts exist to reduce hyperscaler conflict risk.
