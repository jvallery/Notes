# Maturing VAST SaaS support model

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Account**: [[VAST]]
**Attendees**: Rob Banga, Jason Vallery

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Rob Banga aligned on evolving VAST’s support and customer success model to be cloud/SaaS-ready, including proactive TAM/CSM capabilities, cloud-grade incident management, and metrics-driven operations. They discussed creating paid premium support tiers with clear SLAs/SLOs, implementing time tracking/billing and SKUs, and addressing data sovereignty and government-cleared support requirements, with an in-person sync planned around Supercomputing in St. Louis.
## Action Items
- [ ] Draft job description for a proactive TAM/CSM role (hands-on, customer-facing, proactive adoption/roadmap). @Rob 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Send candidate referrals (CSM/SRE profiles) after reviewing LinkedIn. @Jason Vallery 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Document the end-to-end customer lifecycle and ownership flow (pre-sales to expansion) and review with Rob. @Jason Vallery 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task

- [ ] Stand up time tracking and billing processes and define SKUs/pricing for premium services. @Rob 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Assess data sovereignty and government-cleared support gaps and propose a plan for in-region, cleared coverage. @Rob 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Establish weekly metrics reviews and dashboards for support/NOC/CSM (SLOs, MTTR, backlog, adoption). @Rob 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Define developer on-call rotation and cloud-grade incident management process. @Jason Vallery 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Identify internal VAST engineers suitable for SRE rotations and plan training for cloud specifics. @Rob 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Schedule an in-person sync around Supercomputing in St. Louis. @Jason Vallery 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Share any existing documentation on current engagement/lifecycle to inform the flowchart. @Rob 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Confirm whether Jason should attend AOP or other November meetings. @Jason Vallery 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task
- [ ] Confirm customer requests for dedicated resources and initiate chargeable engagements. @Rob 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task

## Decisions
- Recruit SREs with strong VAST product knowledge and train cloud nuances rather than hiring cloud-only outsiders.
- Shift CSM scope to include proactive engagement and create a paid premium services model for customers that require it.

## Key Information
- Jason Vallery spent 13 years on Azure Storage and led product management for Microsoft’s object storage platform.
- Rob Banga has been at VAST ~3 years; the customer org grew from ~20 to ~130 and added a NOC with two people per shift.
- VAST’s goal is to evolve to an ERA SaaS platform for storage with VAST owning end-to-end operations.
- Current model lacks cloud-caliber incident management and does not have developer on-call rotations.
- CSMs are primarily reactive (tickets, weekly calls, incidents) with limited proactive adoption/roadmap work.
- No formal premium support tiers exist; dedicated support has been delivered ad hoc without charge.
- Time tracking/billing and SKUs for premium services do not exist yet.
- Government/sovereign customer requirements (clearances, in-region staff) are significant; data sovereignty/access controls and cleared coverage are not yet in place.
- VAST engineering is largely in Israel; the organization is not currently set up for data sovereignty and cleared operations.
