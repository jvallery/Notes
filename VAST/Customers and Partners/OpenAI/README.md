# OpenAI

## Recent Context

- 2025-11-12: [[2025-11-12 - Announcements]] - Analysis of Microsoft’s updated AI capacity and monetization strategy (Azure Foundry/token APIs) and... (via Microsoft)

## Key Facts

- Microsoft’s 'Big Pause' is over; Microsoft is scrambling for near-term AI capacity across self-build, leases, and neocloud.
- Microsoft monetization thesis: Tokens/API > IaaS; Azure Foundry positioned as a 'token factory'.
- Accelerator dependencies: Nvidia remains primary; MAIA lags; Microsoft may use OpenAI’s ASIC.
- Oct 28 agreement details: Azure API exclusivity for OpenAI continues; Microsoft IP rights extended to 2032; research IP access ends by AGI panel decision or 2030; OpenAI to purchase $250B+ of Azure services; no right-of-first-refusal for Microsoft; both can independently pursue AGI.
- Training vs post-training/inference mix is shifting; post-training compute is ramping and latency-insensitive, enabling remote DC placement.
- Economic life of GPUs expected to exceed 2–3 years, implying long-lived clusters with continual data growth needs (checkpoints, logs, evals, datasets).

## Topics

Microsoft AI capacity planning (self-build, leases, neocloud), Azure Foundry monetization (tokens/API vs IaaS), Microsoft–OpenAI partnership terms (exclusivity, IP, ROFR, $250B Azure commitment), Accelerator roadmap uncertainty (Nvidia, MAIA, OpenAI ASIC), Storage positioning for training, post-training, and inference, Neocloud co-sell strategy and cross-cloud data mobility

## Open Tasks

- [ ] Discuss with OpenAI the idea of providing a sync engine/data movement capability (in response to OpenAI moving away from Blob’s replication engine).

## Opportunities

- Propose VAST as portable, consistent data fabric spanning multi-provider deployments (Azure and other providers) and future OpenAI ASIC pods.
- Target OpenAI directly for multi-provider builds given no Microsoft ROFR; position VAST as common data layer across providers.

## Blockers

- ❌ Operational loosened exclusivity constraints may increase multi-provider complexity; need consistent data layer.

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Initial framing decision: avoid focusing only on OpenAI and Microsoft AI as the only customers; aim for a broader 'in for a pound' approach (directional preference stated by Jeff).
