# OpenAI

## Recent Context

- 2025-12-19: [[2025-12-19]] - Conversation between Jason Vallery and Jeff Denworth about how to approach Microsoft/OpenAI storage ... (via Jeff Denworth)

## Key Facts

- OpenAI is reportedly replatforming away from Azure Blob API for some scenarios, replacing parts with their own solution using Rclone and other components.
- Pete Eming (reports to Vamshi) took over ownership of the Azure Storage relationship with OpenAI and Microsoft AI after Jason left about a year ago.
- Jason believes the main competition at OpenAI is internal: an in-house storage/object-store effort tied to Rockset/RocksDB rather than external vendors.
- Microsoft’s deal with OpenAI was described as giving Microsoft exclusive ownership/rights to every line of code written at OpenAI until an AGI declaration event; this could allow Microsoft to reuse OpenAI-developed storage IP for Azure services.
- OpenAI is reportedly getting bare metal L-Series, bare metal UltraDisc, and Blob Storage HDD clusters; some may be used to run the Rockset-based solution.
