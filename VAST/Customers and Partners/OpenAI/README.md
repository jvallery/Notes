## Key Facts

- VAST plans a touch base meeting on Tuesday with the OpenAI team to align on POC next steps, OpenAI resource availability, and the POC start date.

- SoftBank completed funding of a $40B investment in OpenAI prior to the end-of-year deadline (noted as internal news in the email).

- OpenAI's first hardware device is rumored to be an audio-based device with new GPT models, and manufacturing is rumored to have moved to Foxconn (noted as internal news in the email).

- OpenAI is organized into three major teams: Applications (ChatGPT and online data), Scaling (between Applications and Research), and Research (data scientists, offline data for training).

- Within OpenAI Applications (online data), two largest platforms mentioned were Rockset (uses local SSDs and persists to Azure Blob) and Snowflake (OpenAI is one of Snowflake's largest customers).

- OpenAI Research uses "offline" data for training GPT models on large frontier supercomputing clusters in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

- OpenAI's Rockset-based system was described as SQL-based and containing the entire history of ChatGPT conversations, persisted to Azure Blob.

- There are internal discussions at OpenAI about integrating or merging more of the Applications datasets with the Research datasets.

- OpenAI Applications (ChatGPT) heavily leverages Azure Cosmos DB for conversation persistence and that this is publicly referenced (per Jason Vallery).

- Rockset is the company OpenAI acquired, founded by the creators of RocksDB, including Venkat Venkataramani, and the system can be described as RocksDB managing persistence on local SSDs with FoundationDB providing key-value semantics, functioning as persistent "memory" for ChatGPT (per Jason Vallery).

- OpenAI Research has an in-house system called DAQ (Data Acquisition) that drives very high throughput and petabyte-scale data, and Louis Feuvrier is the lead developer/architect for DAQ (per Jason Vallery).

- OpenAI has another big data team called "Data Platform" that runs Spark/Databricks workloads and is run by Emma Tang (per Jason Vallery).

- VAST Data has a touch base meeting scheduled this week with the OpenAI team to align on POC next steps, OpenAI resource availability, and the POC start date.

- VAST Data is working on additional education for the Nvidia team that works with OpenAI to support the OpenAI pursuit.

- A VAST Data internal note in the update states SoftBank completed funding of a $40B investment in OpenAI prior to an end-of-year deadline.

- A VAST Data internal note in the update states OpenAI's first hardware device is rumored to be an audio-based device with new GPT models and that manufacturing orders moved to Foxconn.

- OpenAI is organized into three major teams: Applications (ChatGPT and online data), Scaling (between Applications and Research), and Research (data scientists reporting up to Jakob Pachoki, focused on offline data for training on frontier supercomputing clusters including OCI).

- Within OpenAI Applications, two large data platforms mentioned were Rockset (uses local SSDs and persists to Azure Blob) and Snowflake (OpenAI is one of Snowflake's largest customers).

- John Mao's OpenAI contact described Rockset as OpenAI's vector database, SQL-based, and the platform persisted to Azure Blob contains the entire history of ChatGPT conversations.

- There are discussions at OpenAI about integrating or merging more of the Applications datasets with the Research datasets.

- Jason Vallery stated that OpenAI Applications (ChatGPT) heavily leverages Azure Cosmos DB for conversation persistence and that this is publicly referenced as Cosmos DB's largest customer.

- Jason Vallery stated that Rockset is the company OpenAI acquired, founded by the team behind RocksDB, and that the system is effectively RocksDB managing persistence on local SSDs with FoundationDB providing key-value semantics, serving as persistent 'memory' for ChatGPT (more like a persistent KV-store than a KV-cache).

- Jason Vallery stated that OpenAI Research has an in-house system called DAQ (Data Acquisition) for training data, referenced previously in a conversation with a person named Misha, and that Louis Feuvrier is the lead developer/architect for DAQ.

- Jason Vallery stated that OpenAI has another big data team called Data Platform that runs Spark/Databricks workloads and is led by Emma Tang.

- John Mao clarified that Ben Ries reports to John Mao's OpenAI friend, and that the friend reports to Venkat (implied Venkat Venkataramani).

- VAST has a touch base meeting scheduled for Tuesday with the OpenAI team to align on POC next steps, OpenAI resource availability, and the POC start date.

- VAST is working on additional education for the Nvidia team that works with OpenAI.

- OpenAI's first hardware device is rumored to be an audio-based device with new GPT models, and manufacturing order reportedly moved to Foxconn (rumor noted in the email).
