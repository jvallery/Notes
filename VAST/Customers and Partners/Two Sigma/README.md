## Recent Context

- 2025-10-27: [[2025-10-27 - The team debated how to align cloud pricing with the new on‑prem model. Two opti]] - Group meeting transcript debating how to align VAST cloud pricing with the new on-prem core+capacity... (via Pricing)

## Key Facts

- Instance core density varies widely across hyperscalers, skewing any core-based pricing unless normalized.
- Cloud infra COGS for NVMe VMs is high (~$0.15–$0.30/GB/mo), so early cloud use cases are mostly burst.
- Three-phase cloud GTM: private offers now; public PAYGO in ~6 months; full multi-tenant SaaS likely FY28.
- Network limits (e.g., 100 Gbps east-west) can cap performance; extra cores may not translate to throughput.
- Marketplace entitlement/schema changes (notably Google) can take ~3 weeks, creating launch timing risk.
- Hybrid ELAs and marketplace burn-down are important for large customers (example discussed: Two Sigma).
- Initial market list price reference discussed: cloud capacity list around ~$0.07/GB/mo; on-prem list rework targets ~$13/TB plus core component.

## Opportunities

- Hybrid ELA concept discussed (example: 60% on-prem / 40% on GCP) with marketplace burn-down preference
