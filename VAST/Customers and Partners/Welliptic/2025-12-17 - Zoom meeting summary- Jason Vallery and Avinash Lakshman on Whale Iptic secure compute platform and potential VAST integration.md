# Zoom meeting summary: Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman on Whale Iptic secure compute platform and potential VAST integration

**Date**: 2025-12-17

**Account**: [[Welliptic]]

**Attendees**: Myself, Avinash Lakshman

## Summary

Avinash Lakshman presented Whale Iptic's globally distributed secure compute platform for AI agents and Web2 apps, including Icarus (conversational agent) and Cerebrum (trust-aware agent orchestrator SDK), plus a multi-cloud multi-pod architecture and a distributed ledger for data sovereignty and fault tolerance. Jason Vallery discussed VAST Data storage positioning for enterprise and GPU cloud providers and explored potential integration areas around secure, verifiable agent execution and GPU plus distributed-ledger workflows. Jason is expected to send Avinash public links and information about VAST's current and upcoming capabilities for follow-up.


## Action Items


- [?] Send Avinash Lakshman a follow-up email with public links and information about VAST Data's current and upcoming capabilities to support evaluation of integration or alignment with Whale Iptic's platform. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Review the VAST Data information sent by Jason Vallery and consider how Whale Iptic's platform could be integrated or aligned with VAST Data's roadmap, then follow up with ideas or a proposal if applicable. @Avinash Lakshman #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Jason Vallery will send Avinash Lakshman a follow-up email with public links and information about VAST Data's current and upcoming capabilities so Avinash can evaluate potential alignment or integration with Whale Iptic.




## Key Information


- Avinash Lakshman presented Whale Iptic's platform as a globally distributed, cryptographically secure compute platform with virtual sandbox environments for AI agents and Web2 applications.

- Whale Iptic's platform includes Icarus, a conversational agent intended to interact with enterprise-grade systems, and Cerebrum, an SDK for a trust-aware agent orchestrator with fine-grained authorization control and auditability.

- Whale Iptic demonstrated a multi-pod architecture running across AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure to reduce the risk of service disruption from a single cloud provider outage.

- Avinash Lakshman described a distributed ledger system designed to provide data sovereignty and fault tolerance across cloud regions using custom Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms.

- Avinash Lakshman demonstrated a secure LLM management platform that hosts MCP servers and manages LLMs via cloud provider services, using digital signatures and identity-based wallets in the browser for auditable interactions.

- Jason Vallery raised a concern about whether a browser agent is necessary for security in Whale Iptic's approach; Avinash Lakshman responded that the browser agent is minimal and focused on identity management to enable auditability and visibility of actions.

- Jason Vallery described VAST Data's strategy to move up the value stack by combining VAST's storage platform with an AI agent engine, targeting enterprises with data lakes in hyperscalers and GPUs distributed across multiple neocloud providers.

- Jason Vallery stated that VAST Data provides storage solutions used for training data and model distribution for large language models, and cited companies including xAI, Tesla, and CoreWeave as examples.

- Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman discussed integrating GPU infrastructure with distributed ledger technology to enable secure, verifiable, and observable AI agent execution in a global state scenario.

- The Zoom AI-generated meeting summary claims Jason Vallery referenced a recent $1.2 billion deal involving VAST Data to deliver infrastructure, but the counterparty and details were not specified in the email and should be verified before reuse.
