## Recent Context

- 2025-12-19: [[2025-12-19]] - Discussion between Jeff Denworth and Jason Vallery on VAST’s Microsoft/Azure strategy: what level of... (via Jeff Denworth)

## Key Facts

- OpenAI is reportedly replatforming away from Azure Blob API for some scenarios and building its own data movement solution (e.g., rclone).
- Microsoft’s deal with OpenAI reportedly grants Microsoft ownership/exclusive rights to code written by OpenAI until AGI is declared; Microsoft can reuse/reship that IP.
- AZCopy is open source and is a key data movement tool for Azure Blob; MAI uses it as a data movement engine.
- Bing uses an internal storage platform called Cosmos (not Cosmos DB) with its own API surface; attempts to migrate Bing to Blob reportedly failed.
- Azure premium blob is described as small (likely petabytes, not exabytes); Azure disks business is not the near-term winnable market for VAST.
- Flash supply constraints may persist due to vendor capacity shifting toward higher-margin HBM/DRAM; price of flash recently doubled (per discussion).
- Two distinct integration patterns: (1) offload/tiering in VAST-native format (performance/cost optimized but not readable via native cloud APIs), and (2) exposing existing cloud-native data requiring change notifications and eventual consistency (e.g., Azure Change Feed).
- VAST does not support Azure Key Vault integration today (gap for customer-managed keys).
- Private Link / VNet boundary is a recurring constraint for integrating VAST with Azure managed services; first-party services may have deeper access (e.g., network security perimeter).
- Jason is earmarked to present at SCO; Jeff wants him to be 'lord of all things cloud' and cover AI cloud building with VAST.

## Opportunities

- 12PB POC starting in next couple weeks (vector database mentioned)
