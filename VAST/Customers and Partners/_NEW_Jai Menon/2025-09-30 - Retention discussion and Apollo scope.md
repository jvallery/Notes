# Retention discussion and Apollo scope

**Date**: 2025-09-30
**Account**: [[Jai Menon]]
**Attendees**: Jai Menon, Jason Vallery, Manish, Ong

## Summary

Jason Vallery shared he has multiple external management offers and plans to decide by end of week, prioritizing clear ownership/scope, latitude to execute, stability, and competitive compensation. He is open to staying at Microsoft if Apollo role scope/PM ownership/executive support and rewards/compensation can be clarified; Jai will brief Manish and keep the conversation open while offers finalize.
## Action Items
- [ ] Compile and send best external offer and specific retention asks (scope, ownership, collaborators, resourcing, compensation) to Manish and Jai. @Jason Vallery 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Circle back with Manish to share Jason’s concerns and expectations; align on potential retention path and Apollo leadership options. @Jai Menon 📅 2025-10-26 🔺 #task
- [ ] Update Jason after Manish/Ong rewards discussion with any concrete options. @Jai Menon 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Define Apollo PM ownership, collaborators, resourcing, and executive sponsorship if a retention path is pursued. @Manish 📅 2025-10-26 🔺 #task
- [ ] Clarify whether a management role (not IC) can be offered to Jason within Apollo or related scope. @Manish 📅 2025-10-26 🔺 #task
- [ ] Confirm stance and timeline on clean-sheet versus incremental approach for Apollo storage. @Jai Menon 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Reconnect once offers finalize to review Jason’s decision and any Microsoft counterproposal. @Jai Menon 📅 2025-10-26 ⏫ #task

## Decisions
- Proceed with a wait-and-see approach until Jason’s end-of-week decision.
- Jai will brief Manish on additional details and potential Apollo leadership considerations.

## Key Information
- Jason has been at Microsoft for 13 years and recently returned from a sabbatical.
- Jason feels under-recognized in rewards and without an advocate after Juergen left.
- Jason previously led a 20+ person team, shifted to IC, and prefers a management role.
- Jason has four external opportunities; two are strong and management-oriented.
- Jason plans to decide by end of week and may present his best external offer for a counter.
- Jason’s retention priorities include clear ownership/scope, ability to execute, leadership buy-in, stability, and industry-level compensation.
- Apollo interest depends on clarity of PM ownership, collaborators, resourcing/funding, and executive support.
- Concern: new storage stack delivery is likely 2–3 years out while data centers need storage now.
- Jai believes Apollo requires a clean-sheet approach; incremental (e.g., Bifrost/blob) would not be competitive.
- Jason is not interested in moving to another hyperscaler; prefers a smaller, faster-moving company if leaving.
