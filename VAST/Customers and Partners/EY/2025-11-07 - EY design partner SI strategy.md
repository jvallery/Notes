# EY design partner SI strategy

**Date**: 2025-11-07
**Account**: [[EY]]
**Attendees**: Soraya Alami, Jason Vallery, Jesse Thaloor, John Cedillo

## Summary

The team aligned on a go-to-market strategy with global SIs centered on enterprise workflow automation, prioritizing an Azure-first design-partner motion with EY and executive alignment around Microsoft Ignite. They reviewed VAST’s current cloud posture (no GA marketplace offer yet) and near-term scenarios (burst-to-cloud and repatriation), while planning positioning against Microsoft AI Foundry and progressing a ~3% ACV referral incentive program. Kyndryl will be engaged via an incentive-led workshop, and Accenture/Deloitte learnings reinforced the need for co-developed, productized solutions rather than advisory-only engagements.

## Decisions
- Prioritize an EY design partnership with an Azure-first motion to unlock co-development and a portability-led narrative.
- Concentrate SI engagement on workflow automation practices rather than infrastructure outsourcing to drive repeatable end-to-end solutions.
- Treat Kyndryl as an incentive-driven partner rather than a strategic co-development focus, to be revisited after the workshop.
- Advance a referral incentive program (~3% ACV, licenses only) to enable pay-for-play partners while protecting margin.

## Key Information
- EY is the near-term priority as a design partner starting on Azure, with executive alignment targeted around Microsoft Ignite.
- VAST has no GA cloud marketplace offer yet; near-term cloud fit is burst-to-cloud and repatriation.
- Work is underway on optimized VM shapes and potential bare-metal/storage-core integrations to improve cloud economics.
- Competitive overlap is expected with Microsoft AI Foundry; VAST will emphasize data/workflow portability across clouds and on-prem.
- Accenture is building an opinionated AI/HPC stack that currently includes VAST.
- Deloitte AI Factory lessons suggest advisory-only approaches are insufficient; co-developed, productized solutions are needed.
- A partner referral incentive program at ~3% of ACV (licenses only) is moving through legal approvals.
- Multiple SIs (TCS, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Infosys) are reorganizing around AI, with sales/build misalignment noted.
