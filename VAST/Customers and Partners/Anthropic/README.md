## Key Facts

- Google Distributed Cloud has connected and air-gapped variants; NetApp is the incumbent storage partner.
- Google issued a US-based RFP to replace NetApp for GDC storage; VAST was invited to respond and is undergoing vendor due diligence.
- Google’s emphasis areas include air-gapped support, compliance/attestations (e.g., DISA STIG), ops model (updates, staffing, troubleshooting), multi-tenancy, quotas, encryption, and tags.
- Fort Meade "Gemini as a service" on-prem initiative is described as a Q4 commit and a near-term joint validation path.
- GDC deployments commonly run on Dell; HPE and Cisco are also in scope for hardware options.
- VAST recently launched Google Marketplace offers; broader partnership is still early.
- Resource risk: Greg may be heavily focused on Leidos next year, potentially impacting continuity.
- John runs alliances/partnerships and is the go-to for AMD/NVIDIA and conventional channel partnerships (non-cloud).
- Sagi leads pipelines/serverless; packaging and cloud GTM for pipelines is under-thought.
- Morty owns Neo-cloud feature requirements; he can support Jason but must maintain Neo-cloud coverage.

## Opportunities

- Referenced as using Google TPU technology; context for TPU track
- Referenced as example of Google on-prem TPU hardware deal lacking surrounding software stack; motivates GDC direction
- Ongoing attempts to find the right entry point; multiple mutuals exist but quality varies.
- Mentioned competitively: Data Engine unlikely to be deciding factor vs Weka; storage-led win more likely
- Hyperscaler-scale engagement track (mentioned as target whale)
- Mentioned as fastest-growing model sales on Azure (context for Microsoft diversification beyond OpenAI)
- Referenced as AI tooling example (Claude agents) used for modern dev workflows
