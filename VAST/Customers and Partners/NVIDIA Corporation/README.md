## Key Facts

- RFE 0482 is associated with NVIDIA Corporation and the opportunity 'DGX-C | Coreweave' (opportunity amount $0, close date 2025-11-02).

- NVIDIA DGX Cloud Storage Team uses VAST across more than five NCPs and manages multiple petabytes of capacity, but lacks a unified operational view due to inconsistent telemetry and dashboards per NCP.

- RFE 0482 requests dual-uplink visibility for a dedicated VAST cluster 'LAX-02', allowing both lambda.cloud.vastdata.com and nvidiadgxc.cloud.vastdata.com to see the same cluster.

- RFE 0482 requests tenant-scoped visibility for a multi-tenant VAST cluster 'LAX-03', so nvidiadgxc.cloud.vastdata.com can access only NVIDIA DGX Cloud tenant metrics/workloads/config/health without exposing other tenants or cluster-wide information.

- RFE 0482 lists estimated incremental value of $100,000,000 and 10,000 PB, and is marked 'Deal Blocker: No'.
