# IHDF executive session recap: public stance risk, fundraising committee, Longmont church acquisition exploration

**Date**: 2025-12-10
**Forum**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Erika Smith, Perla Delgado, Max (last name unknown), Shannon (last name unknown), Maureen (last name unknown), Jorin (last name unknown), Tracy (last name unknown), Myself

## Summary

Erika Smith sent a confidential recap of an IHDF executive session that Jason Vallery missed. Key points were risks of taking public stances (tax-exempt status and donor/community impact), agreement to form a broader fundraising committee, and an early-stage exploration of acquiring a former church in Longmont with a small group to assess feasibility and report back to the board.


## Action Items


- [?] Follow up with Erika Smith to get any missing angles from the IHDF executive session recap and confirm next steps for executive-session discussion at end of board meetings. @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Assess IHDF staff needs related to fundraising support and report findings to the board/fundraising committee organizers. @Perla Delgado ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Share the initial SWOT document draft for the potential acquisition of the former church in Longmont (co-created with Erika Smith) with relevant board members. @Perla Delgado #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Evaluate initial feasibility of acquiring the former church in Longmont and report back to the IHDF board. @TBD #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- IHDF will form a fundraising committee with a broader development scope beyond events and marketing (including volunteers and stewardship), potentially including non-board members and a budget.

- IHDF will use executive session time at the end of board meetings to discuss the impact and risks of taking public stances on certain matters (including tax-exempt status and donor/community impact).

- IHDF will conduct an initial feasibility assessment of acquiring a former church in Longmont and have Maureen (last name unknown), Jorin (last name unknown), Tracy (last name unknown), and Perla Delgado report back to the board.




## Key Information


- Erika Smith stated that taking public stances on some matters could create issues with IHDF's tax-exempt status and could disenfranchise donors and the community, and recommended discussing the impact in an executive session at the end of board meetings.

- IHDF board members agreed to form a fundraising committee that goes beyond events and marketing, with a broader development lens including volunteers and stewardship, and it may include non-board members and potentially a budget.

- Perla Delgado needs to assess IHDF staff needs related to fundraising support; some members believe IHDF has the best development leadership in place now.

- IHDF is in very early exploration of acquiring a former church in Longmont that is for sale at a low price; it is not currently in any organizational plan and is considered confidential and in infancy.

- Perla Delgado will share the start of a SWOT document for the potential Longmont former church acquisition that Erika Smith co-created.

- Maureen (last name unknown), Jorin (last name unknown), Tracy (last name unknown), and Perla Delgado will evaluate initial feasibility of the potential Longmont former church acquisition and report back to the IHDF board.
