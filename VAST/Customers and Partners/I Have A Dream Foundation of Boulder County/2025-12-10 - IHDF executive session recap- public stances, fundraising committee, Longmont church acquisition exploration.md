# IHDF executive session recap: public stances, fundraising committee, Longmont church acquisition exploration

**Date**: 2025-12-10
**Forum**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Erika Smith, Perla Delgado, Max (last name unknown), Shannon (last name unknown), Maureen (last name unknown), Jorin (last name unknown), Tracy (last name unknown), Myself

## Summary

Erika Smith sent a confidential recap of an IHDF executive session that Jason Vallery missed. Key points were risks of taking public stances (tax-exempt status and donor/community impact), agreement to form a broader fundraising committee, and an early-stage exploration of acquiring a former church in Longmont with a small group to assess feasibility and report back to the board.


## Action Items


- [?] Follow up with Erika Smith to request any missing details from the IHDF executive session recap (as needed). @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Assess IHDF staff needs related to fundraising support and report findings to the appropriate IHDF leadership/board group. @Perla Delgado ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Share the initial SWOT document for the potential acquisition of the former church in Longmont (co-created with Erika Smith) with relevant IHDF board members. @Perla Delgado #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Evaluate initial feasibility of acquiring the former church in Longmont and report back to the IHDF board. @TBD #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- IHDF will form a fundraising committee with a broader development scope beyond events and marketing (including volunteers and stewardship), potentially including non-board members and a budget.

- IHDF will discuss the impact and risks of taking public stances in an executive session at the end of board meetings.




## Key Information


- Erika Smith stated that taking public stances on some matters could create issues with IHDF's tax-exempt status and could disenfranchise donors and the community, and recommended discussing the impact in an executive session at the end of board meetings.

- IHDF executive session participants agreed to form a fundraising committee with a broader development scope beyond events and marketing, including volunteers, stewardship, and potentially non-board members and a budget.

- Perla Delgado was asked to assess IHDF staff needs related to fundraising support.

- IHDF is in very early-stage exploration of acquiring a former church in Longmont that is for sale at a low price; the idea is not currently part of any organizational plan and was requested to be kept confidential.

- Perla Delgado will share the start of a SWOT document for the potential Longmont former church acquisition that Erika Smith co-created.

- A small group (Maureen, Jorin, Tracy, and Perla Delgado) will evaluate initial feasibility of the potential Longmont former church acquisition and report back to the IHDF board.
