## Key Facts

- Jason has a VAST offer with complex, highly variable compensation tied to OpenAI/Azure sales plus equity.
- Crusoe offer deadline is Wednesday; VAST has not set a decision deadline.
- Microsoft cannot approach Crusoe-level compensation; any change would be modest and potentially insulting.
- Apollo scope and responsibilities are unclear, making it hard to define a successful role or path to partner.
- Jason values clear scope, hands-on technical work, and influencing customer deals.
- Jason estimates ~$800k in vested compensation would be forfeited if leaving Microsoft.
- Jason planned to meet Renan (described as VAST CEO) to quantify risk and negotiate equity/commission.
- Jason stated staying at Microsoft is effectively a closed option.
- Jason Vallery moved from Microsoft Azure Storage to VAST Data to drive hyperscaler penetration and cloud product management.
- Kushal Datta is on Microsoft's Apollo team.

## Opportunities

- Hyperscaler penetration via Microsoft Apollo; qualify VAST-optimized hardware SKUs for Azure and run VAST on Azure storage clusters bare metal
- Employment offer to Jason with PM/BD/sales-support scope; focus on OpenAI and Azure-related success
- Competitive/partner reference point for NVIDIA alignment and agentic/key-value store vision
