# Google GDC Storage RFP follow-up: compliance, pricing/HW, BYOH partner list, and meeting request

**Date**: 2025-12-17

**Account**: [[Google]]

**Attendees**: Lior Genzel, David Pawlak, Jason Vallery, Kamal Vyas, Ryan Terrell

## Summary

Google (David Pawlak) requested a 1-hour meeting to review and clarify VAST Data's GDC Storage RFP proposal and followed up with specific questions on FIPS compliance, whether recurring pricing includes hardware and SED SSDs, and BYOH preferred hardware partners. Lior Genzel looped in Jason Vallery to lead the SED response and indicated VAST includes SSD hardware pricing (no HDDs) and can work with Google to certify a Google-preferred hardware partner.


## Action Items


- [?] Respond to Google (David Pawlak) with clarification on whether the proposed GDC Storage RFP solution uses Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs) for the SSD component. @Myself 📅 2025-12-19 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide Google (David Pawlak) a clear statement on how VAST Data's proposed GDC Storage RFP offering meets FIPS compliance requirements, addressing Kamal Vyas's question. @TBD 📅 2025-12-19 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm to Google (David Pawlak) that recurring pricing in the GDC Storage RFP proposal includes SSD hardware and that VAST Data does not sell HDDs, and clarify any pricing validity constraints tied to SSD supply conditions. @Lior Genzel 📅 2025-12-19 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Collect and send Google (David Pawlak) the full list of VAST Data globally certified hardware partners for BYOH deployments, beyond Cisco, Dell, HPE, and SuperMicro, by checking with VAST partner groups. @Lior Genzel 📅 2025-12-22 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate scheduling with Google (David Pawlak) for a 1-hour follow-up meeting to walk through Google's document and questions on the GDC Storage RFP proposal, including assessing feasibility of a Friday meeting with Jason Vallery vs targeting Monday. @Myself 📅 2025-12-19 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions

- Lior Genzel (VAST Data) stated that the proposed GDC Storage RFP solution includes hardware pricing and includes SSDs, and that VAST Data does not sell HDDs.

- Lior Genzel (VAST Data) stated that the hardware pricing in the proposal is valid for the proposal time and noted a global SSD shortage with expected higher SSD prices into 2026.

- Lior Genzel (VAST Data) indicated Jason Vallery (VAST Data) would take the lead on answering whether the solution uses Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs) for the SSD component.

- Lior Genzel (VAST Data) stated VAST can work with Google to certify a Google-preferred hardware partner for BYOH because the project represents sufficiently large business upside.

- Lior Genzel (VAST Data) stated VAST already has Cisco, Dell, HPE, and SuperMicro certified as eBox partners for VAST deployments.

- Lior Genzel (VAST Data) stated Arrow and Avnet are certified as ODM partners manufacturing VAST C-Box and D-Box solutions.
