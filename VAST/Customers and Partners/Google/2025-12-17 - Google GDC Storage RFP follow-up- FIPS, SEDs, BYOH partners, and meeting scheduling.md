## Summary

Google (David Pawlak) requested a follow-up meeting to review and clarify VAST Data's Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) Storage RFP proposal and asked specific questions on FIPS compliance, whether recurring pricing includes hardware and SSD Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs), and BYOH partner options. Lior Genzel looped in Jason Vallery to lead the SEDs response and stated VAST includes SSD hardware pricing (no HDDs) and can work with Google to certify a Google-preferred hardware partner.
