# Google GDC Storage RFP follow-ups: FIPS, SEDs, BYOH partners, and scheduling

**Date**: 2025-12-17
**Account**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Lior Genzel, Jason Vallery, David Pawlak, Kamal Vyas, Ryan Terrell

## Summary

Google (David Pawlak) requested a follow-up meeting to review and clarify VAST Data's Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) Storage RFP proposal and asked specific questions on FIPS compliance, whether recurring pricing includes hardware and SSDs with Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs), and BYOH preferred hardware partners. Lior Genzel looped in Jason Vallery to lead the SEDs response and committed to checking VAST's partner org for a full list of certified hardware partners; Google pushed to meet quickly (including Friday) to walk VAST through a document for offline work.
