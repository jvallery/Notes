**Date**: 2025-12-17

**Account**: [[Google]]

**Attendees**: Lior Genzel, Jason Vallery, David Pawlak, Kamal Vyas, Unknown VAST contact (ryan.terrell@vastdata.com)

## Summary

Google (David Pawlak) requested follow-up clarification on VAST Data's GDC Storage RFP proposal, specifically FIPS compliance, whether recurring pricing includes SSD hardware and whether SSDs are Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs), and BYOH preferred hardware partners. Lior Genzel looped in Jason Vallery to answer the SED question and Google asked to meet with Jason on Friday to walk through a document; Lior suggested targeting Monday due to being mostly off Friday.
