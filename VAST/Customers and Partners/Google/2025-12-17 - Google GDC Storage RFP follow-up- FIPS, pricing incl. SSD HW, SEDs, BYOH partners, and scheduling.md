# Google GDC Storage RFP follow-up: FIPS, pricing incl. SSD HW, SEDs, BYOH partners, and scheduling

**Date**: 2025-12-17

**Account**: [[Google]]

**Attendees**: Lior Genzel, David Pawlak, Myself, Kamal Vyas, extraction_errors

## Summary

Google (David Pawlak) requested a follow-up meeting to review VAST Data's GDC Storage RFP proposal and asked for clarifications on FIPS compliance, whether recurring pricing includes SSD hardware and uses self-encrypting drives, and BYOH preferred hardware partners. Lior Genzel looped in Jason Vallery to answer the SED question and stated VAST includes SSD hardware pricing (no HDDs) and can work with Google to certify a Google-preferred hardware partner; Google pushed to meet with Jason on Friday or otherwise Monday.


## Action Items


- [?] Provide Google (David Pawlak) a written clarification on whether VAST Data's proposed GDC Storage RFP solution uses Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs) for the SSD component, and any relevant security/compliance details needed for the RFP response. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Send Jason Vallery's email address to David Pawlak (Google) so Google can include Jason directly on the GDC Storage RFP follow-up thread and meeting coordination. @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Google (David Pawlak) to schedule a follow-up meeting to review Google's document and questions about VAST Data's GDC Storage RFP proposed solution, targeting Monday after December 18, 2025 if Friday is not possible. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Check with VAST Data partner organization for the full list of globally certified hardware partners for BYOH deployments and share the list with Google (David Pawlak) for the GDC Storage RFP. @Lior Genzel #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- VAST Data selected Monday, December 15, 2025 at 2:00pm PT as the requested one-hour meeting time for the initial Google GDC Storage RFP review call (per Lior Genzel: 'The 15th at 2 pm PT please').
