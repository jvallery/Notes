# Google GDC Storage RFP follow-up: compliance, pricing, BYOH partner list, and meeting request

**Date**: 2025-12-17

**Account**: [[Google]]

**Attendees**: Lior Genzel, Jason Vallery, David Pawlak, Kamal Vyas, Unknown VAST contact (ryan.terrell@vastdata.com)

## Summary

Google (David Pawlak) requested a follow-up meeting to review and clarify VAST Data's GDC Storage RFP proposal and asked for written clarifications on FIPS compliance, whether recurring pricing includes hardware and SED SSDs, and BYOH preferred hardware partners. Lior Genzel looped in Jason Vallery to lead the SED question and indicated VAST can certify a Google-preferred hardware partner and already has several certified eBox and ODM partners.


## Action Items


- [?] Reply to Google (David Pawlak) with clarification on whether the proposed GDC Storage RFP solution uses Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs) for the SSD component, and provide the specific SED posture for the proposed configuration. @Myself 📅 2025-12-19 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with VAST partner organization to compile and send Google a complete list of VAST globally certified hardware partners that can support a BYOH deployment for the GDC Storage RFP (beyond Cisco, Dell, HPE, SuperMicro, Arrow, and Avnet). @Lior Genzel 📅 2025-12-22 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm with Lior Genzel and Google whether a follow-up meeting should occur on Friday 2025-12-19 (Google preference) or Monday 2025-12-22 (Lior preference), and propose specific one-hour time slots in PT. @Myself 📅 2025-12-19 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide Google a written clarification of VAST Data's FIPS compliance position for the proposed GDC Storage RFP offering, including which components are in scope for FIPS and how compliance is achieved. @TBD 📅 2025-12-22 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Lior Genzel selected Monday 2025-12-15 at 2:00pm PT as the meeting time for the initial one-hour call to review the GDC Storage RFP proposal (based on the scheduling thread where Lior requested 'The 15th at 2 pm PT please' and David Pawlak confirmed the invite was sent).




## Key Information

- Lior Genzel (VAST Data) stated that the hardware pricing in the GDC Storage RFP proposal is valid for the proposal time and noted a global SSD shortage with expected higher SSD prices into 2026.

- Lior Genzel (VAST Data) indicated Jason Vallery (VAST Data) would take the lead on answering whether the proposed solution uses Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs) for the SSD component.

- Lior Genzel (VAST Data) stated VAST can work with Google to certify a Google-preferred hardware partner for BYOH because the project represents sufficiently large business upside.

- Lior Genzel (VAST Data) stated VAST already has Cisco, Dell, HPE, and SuperMicro certified as eBox partners for its offering.

- Lior Genzel (VAST Data) stated Arrow and Avnet are certified as ODM partners manufacturing VAST C-Box and D-Box solutions.

- David Pawlak (Google) requested a one-hour call for VAST Data to walk through the GDC Storage RFP submission and approach, with Google preparing questions and also addressing them live.

- Lior Genzel (VAST Data) said he was mostly off on Friday 2025-12-19 and proposed targeting Monday for the follow-up meeting with Google.
