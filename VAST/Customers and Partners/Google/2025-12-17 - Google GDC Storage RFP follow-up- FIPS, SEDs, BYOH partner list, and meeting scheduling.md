# Google GDC Storage RFP follow-up: FIPS, SEDs, BYOH partner list, and meeting scheduling

**Date**: 2025-12-17

**Account**: [[Google]]

**Attendees**: Lior Genzel, David Pawlak, Myself, Kamal Vyas, Ryan Terrell

## Summary

Google (David Pawlak) requested a follow-up meeting to review and clarify VAST Data's GDC Storage RFP proposal and asked for written clarifications on FIPS compliance, whether recurring pricing includes hardware and Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs), and BYOH preferred hardware partners. Lior Genzel looped in Jason Vallery to address the SEDs question and committed to checking with VAST partner teams for a full list of certified global hardware partners.


## Action Items


- [?] Respond to Google (David Pawlak) with clarification on whether the proposed GDC Storage RFP solution uses Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs) for the SSD component, and any relevant compliance details tied to SED usage. @Myself 📅 2025-12-19 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide Google (David Pawlak) a consolidated list of VAST Data globally certified hardware partners for BYOH, after checking with VAST partner teams (beyond Cisco, Dell, HPE, SuperMicro, Arrow, and Avnet already mentioned). @Lior Genzel 📅 2025-12-22 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Google (David Pawlak) to schedule a minimum 60-minute follow-up meeting to walk through Google's document and address open questions on the GDC Storage RFP proposal, targeting Monday 2025-12-22 if possible. @TBD 📅 2025-12-22 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto
