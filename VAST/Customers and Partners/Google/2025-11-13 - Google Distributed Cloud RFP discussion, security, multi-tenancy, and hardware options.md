# Google Distributed Cloud RFP discussion, security, multi-tenancy, and hardware options

**Date**: 2025-11-13
**Account**: [[Google]]
**Attendees**: Jason Vallery

## Summary

Discussion focused on requirements and open questions for the Google Distributed Cloud RFP, including TCO tradeoffs (HDD vs QLC), security controls for air-gapped environments, and operational processes for patching and troubleshooting. The group also covered multi-tenancy controls (QoS, quotas, tags, policy-based management), availability zones, hardware partner options (notably Dell), and potential GCS API integration.


## Action Items


- [?] Schedule and hold a follow-up discussion with Mallikarjun to clarify Google Distributed Cloud RFP requirements (multi-tenancy controls, air-gapped operations, and GCS API expectations). @Myself 📅 2025-11-20 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule and hold a follow-up discussion with Manu to align on federal mutual-customer requirements, including separation of duties and any two-signature operational controls. @Myself 📅 2025-11-14 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm whether the planned meeting with Manu is set for Friday, 2025-11-14 at 12:00pm PT, and send a calendar invite with agenda (federal requirements, air-gapped ops, patching model). @Myself 📅 2025-11-13 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Prepare a short comparison summary for the Google Distributed Cloud RFP on HDD vs QLC TCO assumptions and when each configuration is recommended. @Myself 📅 2025-11-21 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Document VAST's approach for air-gapped deployments: security certifications, SED usage, network security posture, and remote patching/troubleshooting procedures for the Google Distributed Cloud RFP response. @Myself 📅 2025-11-21 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Follow up on AI Pipelines whiteboarding session to capture tradeoffs and decisions needed for the Google Distributed Cloud RFP narrative. @Myself 📅 2025-11-27 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Engage Dell to validate recommended hardware shapes and configurations suitable for Google Distributed Cloud RFP requirements (including encryption and multi-tenancy considerations). @Myself 📅 2025-11-27 #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- The Google Distributed Cloud RFP evaluation includes a total cost of ownership comparison between HDD-based configurations and QLC flash-based configurations.

- The Google Distributed Cloud RFP discussion included requirements around self-encrypting drives (SED) and air-gapped security details, including certifications.

- Operational requirements for the Google Distributed Cloud RFP include how VAST would manage, troubleshoot, and remotely patch systems in restricted or air-gapped environments.

- Multi-tenancy requirements discussed for the Google Distributed Cloud RFP include QoS/quotas, tags, and policy-based management to apply controls per tenant or per workload.

- Hardware partner alignment for the Google Distributed Cloud RFP included discussing hardware recommendation shapes with Dell.

- The Google Distributed Cloud RFP discussion included potential integration questions around the Google Cloud Storage API (GCS API).

- A federal connection was discussed for a mutual customer, involving security engineering and operations considerations such as separation of duties and a two-signature rule.
