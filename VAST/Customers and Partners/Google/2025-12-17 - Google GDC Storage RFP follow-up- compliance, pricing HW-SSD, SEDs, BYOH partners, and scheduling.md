# Google GDC Storage RFP follow-up: compliance, pricing (HW/SSD), SEDs, BYOH partners, and scheduling

**Date**: 2025-12-17

**Account**: [[Google]]

**Attendees**: Lior Genzel, Jason Vallery, David Pawlak, Kamal Vyas, Ryan Terrell

## Summary

Google (David Pawlak) requested follow-up clarifications on VAST Data's Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) Storage RFP proposal, including FIPS compliance, whether recurring pricing includes hardware and SSDs, whether SSDs are Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs), and BYOH partner options. Lior Genzel looped in Jason Vallery to lead the SEDs response and noted VAST can certify a Google-preferred hardware partner; Google also requested an additional meeting to walk VAST through a document.
