# Google GDC Storage RFP follow-up: FIPS, SEDs, BYOH partners, and scheduling

**Date**: 2025-12-17

**Account**: [[Google]]

**Attendees**: Lior Genzel, David Pawlak, Myself, Kamal Vyas

## Summary

Google (David Pawlak) requested follow-up clarifications on VAST's GDC Storage RFP proposal, specifically FIPS compliance, whether recurring pricing includes hardware and SSDs, whether SSDs are Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs), and BYOH preferred hardware partners. Lior Genzel looped in Jason Vallery to answer the SED question and stated VAST can work with Google to certify a Google-preferred hardware partner; Google also requested an additional meeting to walk VAST through a document.


## Action Items


- [?] Provide Google (David Pawlak) clarification on whether the proposed VAST GDC Storage RFP solution uses Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs) for the SSD component. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Confirm and provide Google (David Pawlak) a list of VAST globally certified hardware partners for BYOH, after checking with VAST partner groups. @Lior Genzel #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Google (David Pawlak) to schedule a minimum one-hour follow-up meeting to walk through Google's document and address questions on the GDC Storage RFP proposal, targeting Monday after 2025-12-18. @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Lior Genzel proposed targeting Monday (instead of Friday) for the next Google follow-up meeting because he was mostly off on Friday, 2025-12-19.




## Key Information


- David Pawlak (Google) did not have Jason Vallery's email address and asked Lior Genzel to loop Jason in on the GDC Storage RFP follow-up.

- Lior Genzel stated that the proposed VAST solution pricing includes hardware pricing and includes SSDs, and that VAST does not sell HDDs.

- Lior Genzel stated that the hardware pricing in the proposal is valid for the proposal time and noted a global SSD shortage with expected higher SSD prices into 2026.

- Lior Genzel stated that VAST can work with Google to certify a Google-preferred hardware partner for BYOH because the project has sufficiently large business upside.

- Lior Genzel stated VAST already has Cisco, Dell, HPE, and SuperMicro certified as eBox partners.

- Lior Genzel stated Arrow and Avnet are certified as ODM partners manufacturing VAST C/D Box solutions.

- Kamal Vyas (Google) raised a question about whether VAST's proposed offering meets FIPS compliance standards for the GDC Storage RFP.
