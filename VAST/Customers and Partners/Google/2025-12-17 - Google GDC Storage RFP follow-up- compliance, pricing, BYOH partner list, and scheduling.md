# Google GDC Storage RFP follow-up: compliance, pricing, BYOH partner list, and scheduling

**Date**: 2025-12-17

**Account**: [[Google]]

**Attendees**: Lior Genzel, Jason Vallery, David Pawlak, Kamal Vyas, Ryan Terrell

## Summary

Google (David Pawlak) requested a follow-up meeting to review and clarify VAST Data's GDC Storage RFP proposal and asked for written clarifications on FIPS compliance, whether recurring pricing includes hardware and SSDs, whether SSDs are self-encrypting (SED), and BYOH preferred hardware partners. Lior Genzel looped in Jason Vallery to address the SED question and stated VAST can certify a Google-preferred hardware partner; Google pushed to meet with Jason on Friday to walk through a document.
