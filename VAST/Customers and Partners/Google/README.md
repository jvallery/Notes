## Key Facts

- John runs alliances/partnerships and is the go-to for AMD/NVIDIA and channel (non-cloud).
- Sagi leads pipelines/serverless and needs alignment on cloud GTM and packaging.
- Morty owns Neo cloud feature requirements and must maintain that coverage while supporting the author’s area.
- Rob’s customer success org is primarily support and systems engineering today.
- Confluence is the source of record for FRDs/customer requirements for engineering consumption.
- Google RFP may be TPU-oriented; ensure scope is not block-I/O latency sensitive where NetApp excels.
- Jeff will be in Orlando Tue–Thu next week for sales strategy; SE engagement is high value.
- Risk: ambiguity between author scope and Lior’s could cause ownership gaps and misaligned priorities.
- Jason’s mandate is to own multi-cloud strategy end-to-end and translate deal flow into requirements, Confluence docs, and focused cloud plays (Azure/AWS/GCP/Oracle plus Foundry/Bedrock/Vertex).
- Near-term proof points include building the 'dagger' Azure slide, establishing a win/loss cadence, and embedding with SEs during/after Tech Summit.

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Carl will move to ProServe under Rob rather than supporting customer-facing PM work.
- ✅ Set a monthly touchpoint with Brandon to align on cloud platform priorities.
- ✅ Customer requirement docs and FRDs will be authored and maintained in Confluence.
- ✅ Focus on building a first-class cross-cloud platform and GTM versus ad hoc deal chasing.
- ✅ China should be approached as a sales outpost rather than a location for significant capital investment or operational infrastructure.
- ✅ Carl will move to ProServe under Rob due to limitations in customer-facing roles.
