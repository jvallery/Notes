## Key Facts

- Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) is a GCP-like experience deployed into private/hybrid data centers, including an air-gapped variant.
- Google issued a US-based RFP inviting VAST to respond as a potential replacement for NetApp for GDC storage.
- RFP follow-ups include FIPS/SED posture and encryption key granularity across S3 and NFS (plus SSE-C expectations).
- Cloud Marketplace work includes onboarding Tackle to connect VAST’s existing GCP Marketplace listing and enable private offers and reporting exports.
- Polaris is expected to be the source of truth for entitlement/metering and to receive fulfillment events/notifications for activation and gating.
- Z4M networking and RDMA constraints (plus cross-project connectivity) are key technical considerations for a storage-serving VM path on GCP.

## Topics

- GDC RFP: technical gaps, compliance posture, and next-step clarifications
- Marketplace/private offers: entitlements, metering, reporting, and overage policy
- GCP networking: VIP/failover, RDMA connectivity, and deployment constraints
