- Google issued a US-based RFP inviting VAST to respond as a potential replacement for NetApp for GDC storage.
- RFP follow-ups include FIPS/SED posture and encryption key granularity across S3 and NFS (plus SSE-C expectations).
- Cloud Marketplace work includes onboarding Tackle to connect VAST’s existing GCP Marketplace listing and enable private offers and reporting exports.
- Polaris is expected to be the source of truth for entitlement/metering and to receive fulfillment events/notifications for activation and gating.
- Z4M networking and RDMA constraints (plus cross-project connectivity) are key technical considerations for a storage-serving VM path on GCP.

- Google Docs sent an automated share request notification email from drive-shares-dm-noreply@google.com.

- Whale Iptic was described as running a multi-pod architecture across Google Cloud Platform as part of a multi-cloud reliability strategy.

- The presentation share notification was sent via Google Slides (Google LLC).

- Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) is being discussed as a potential VAST Data support area tied to hyperscaler acquisition and cloud consumption.

- Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP includes a must-have requirement for TLS support for VAST Block protocol (per Itzik Reich).

- An internal VAST meeting was scheduled to coordinate on a Google RFP (request for proposal).

- Google Slides sent an automated notification that a presentation was shared from the account jonsi@vastdata.com.

## Key Decisions

- Lior Genzel selected Monday 2025-12-15 at 2:00pm PT as the meeting time for the initial one-hour call to review the GDC Storage RFP proposal (based on the scheduling thread where Lior requested 'The 15th at 2 pm PT please' and David Pawlak confirmed the invite was sent).
