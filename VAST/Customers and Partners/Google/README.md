## Opportunities

- GDC Storage RFP: provide normalized performance + pricing data in Google Excel template for VAST (NVMe/TCP, NFSv4, S3)
- Align first 2–3 lighthouse customers for GCP GA rollout
- TPU strategy outside GCP (pending disclosure; prep meetings such as GTC-DC).
- Cloud deployment capacity/overhead modeling aligned to GCP fault-domain structure and rolling update budgets (MIG maxUnavailable/maxSurge).
- Google private offer marketplace entitlements and pricing schema; approval process initiated
- Similar proxy/tiering conversation as Walmart; relationship with existing cloud stores and namespace integration
- Google Distributed Cloud RFP to replace NetApp storage
- Fort Meade on-prem "Gemini as a service" validation (Q4 commit)
- Joint federal account alignment (FBI, State, Army referenced as opportunities)
- Potential TPU/model-builder partnership track

## Blockers

- ❌ Template requests Self-Encrypting Drives (FIPS 140-2/3), but VAST does not support SEDs; must position software-based dual encryption instead
- ❌ Potential mismatch between requested '112TiB usable' sizing and nearest sellable SKU; must document nearest-SKU approach with extra explanatory rows
- ❌ GA timing dependent on post-bottleneck fix
- ❌ Two-week timeline for disclosure of TPU strategy outside GCP.
- ❌ Sub-zonal availability domain support varies by region/zone; wide EC (e.g., 7+1) depends on actual availability domain guarantees.
