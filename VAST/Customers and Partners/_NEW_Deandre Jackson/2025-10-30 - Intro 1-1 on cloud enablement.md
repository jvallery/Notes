# Intro 1:1 on cloud enablement

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Account**: [[Deandre Jackson]]
**Attendees**: Jason Vallery, Deandre Jackson

## Summary

Jason Vallery and Deandre (Dre) Jackson held an intro 1:1 focused on SE enablement for object/S3 and VAST’s cloud positioning. They aligned to emphasize workload-centric enablement (scenarios over generic object features), clarified current cloud status (no marketplace transactability; Google private offers; AWS/Azure roadmap), and discussed GPU scarcity and MinIO price-driven competition as key constraints.
## Action Items
- [ ] Send S3/Object course link and materials to Jason @Dre 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Review the S3/Object course and provide structured feedback to Dre @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Collect and share SE/customer feedback on cloud blockers and desired workloads @Dre 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Clarify internal messaging to SEs on current cloud status (no marketplace; Google private offers; AWS/Azure roadmap) @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Align with Yonce/Yancey and Tel Aviv platform team on requirements for VAST on Cloud (e.g., capacity offload to CSP object, RDMA to GPUs) @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Assess competitive stance vs MinIO and define qualification guidance for price-driven workloads @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Coordinate a touchpoint at TechSummit to review early enablement feedback and cloud roadmap messaging @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task

## Decisions
- Anchor enablement on workload scenarios rather than generic object features.
- Avoid engaging in price-only competitions (e.g., MinIO) unless the workload merits VAST’s performance/value.

## Key Information
- Deandre (Dre) Jackson is Technical Enablement Director; team recently added 2 heads and is hiring 2 more.
- Weekly SE call alternates technical sales upskilling and leadership/field updates, with 10-minute competitive/pitch segments.
- Jason Vallery is ex-Microsoft Azure object storage PM with AI/OpenAI customer experience; now owns product management for VAST cloud and frontier model builders.
- There is no VAST cloud marketplace transactability today; VAST is doing private offers with Google and has a roadmap to unlock AWS and Azure.
- GPU scarcity at hyperscalers prioritizes first-party initiatives (e.g., OpenAI/Microsoft) ahead of third-party customers, limiting near-term 3P cloud opportunities.
- Dre created a multi-part S3/Object course (fundamentals + sales scenarios; deep-dive WIP) and requested feedback.
- Jeff’s vision described: VAST on Cloud as a SaaS overlay using CSP object capacity with VAST performance and RDMA connectivity to GPUs.
- MinIO often wins on price for low-cost object workloads; VAST should focus on performance/workload-qualified scenarios.
- Current selling guidance mentioned: avoid sub-500TB deals; concern this may miss earlier enterprise growth opportunities.
- SEs are cautious discussing unreleased features; perceived code lateness impacts confidence.
