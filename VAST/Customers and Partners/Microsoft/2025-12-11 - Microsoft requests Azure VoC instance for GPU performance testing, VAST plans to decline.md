# Microsoft requests Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing, VAST plans to decline

**Date**: 2025-12-11
**Account**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Ray Coetzee, Lior Genzel, Karl Vietmeier, Jason Vallery

## Summary

Microsoft is testing a physical VAST POC system in Microsoft's Redmond lab but lacks GPU nodes, so they requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU instances. Lior Genzel directed Ray Coetzee to schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft team and stated VAST will say no because VAST Azure is not ready for this use case.


## Action Items


- [?] Suggest and schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft team who requested an Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing, so Lior Genzel can communicate the decision to decline. @Ray Coetzee ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide the expected performance profile for an Azure VoC instance (if it were to be considered) to inform internal discussion and response to Microsoft. @Karl Vietmeier #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Join the internal thread and align with Lior Genzel and Ray Coetzee on the response to Microsoft regarding the Azure VoC request for GPU performance testing. @Myself #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- VAST Data will not provide an Azure VoC instance to Microsoft for performance testing against Azure GPU instances because VAST Azure is not ready for this use case.




## Key Information


- Microsoft has a physical VAST Data proof-of-concept system installed in Microsoft's lab in Redmond and is actively testing it.

- Microsoft's Redmond lab currently does not have GPU nodes available for testing.

- Microsoft requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU instances because their lab lacks GPU nodes.

- Lior Genzel stated that VAST Data will decline the request for an Azure VoC instance for Microsoft GPU performance testing because VAST Azure is not close to being ready for this use case.

- Lior Genzel asked Ray Coetzee to propose a follow-up call with the Microsoft team who requested the Azure VoC instance so Lior can communicate the decline directly.

- Lior Genzel told Karl Vietmeier that Karl is optional on the follow-up call with Microsoft Azure because Lior plans to block the Azure VoC request.
