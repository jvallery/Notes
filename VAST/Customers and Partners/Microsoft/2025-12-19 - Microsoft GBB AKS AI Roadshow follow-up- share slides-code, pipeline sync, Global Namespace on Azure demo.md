## Summary

After VAST presented VAST + AKS to Microsoft Global Black Belt (GBB) AI infrastructure sellers, Microsoft requested the presented slides and code, a pipeline sync, and a plan for a Global Namespace on Azure demo/accelerator for the AI roadshow.

Mohamad Al Jazaery is out for the next two weeks and asked to reconnect in January.
