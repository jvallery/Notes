# Microsoft request for Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing (declined)

**Date**: 2025-12-11

**Account**: [[Microsoft]]

**Attendees**: Ray Coetzee, Lior Genzel, Karl Vietmeier, Myself

## Summary

Ray Coetzee reported that Microsoft is testing a physical VAST PoC system in Microsoft's Redmond lab but lacks GPU nodes, so Microsoft requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU VMs. Lior Genzel directed Ray to schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft requestors and stated VAST will decline because VAST on Azure is not ready for this use case.


## Action Items


- [?] Schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft team who requested an Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing, so VAST can communicate that the request is declined. @Ray Coetzee ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Communicate to the Microsoft requestors that VAST will not provide an Azure VoC instance for Azure GPU performance testing because VAST on Azure is not ready, and position the physical PoC as the appropriate evaluation vehicle. @Lior Genzel ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide input on the expected performance profile for an Azure VoC instance (if needed for internal alignment), in response to Ray Coetzee's question. @Karl Vietmeier #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- VAST will not provide an Azure VoC instance to Microsoft for Azure GPU performance testing because VAST on Azure is not ready for that use case.




## Key Information


- Microsoft has a physical VAST proof-of-concept (PoC) system installed in Microsoft's lab in Redmond and is actively testing it.

- Microsoft's Redmond lab currently does not have GPU nodes available for testing.

- Microsoft requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU virtual machines because their Redmond lab lacks GPU nodes.

- Lior Genzel stated that VAST will decline Microsoft's request for an Azure VoC instance because VAST on Azure is not close to being ready for this type of performance testing.

- Ray Coetzee asked Karl Vietmeier to define the expected performance profile of an Azure VoC instance for Microsoft testing.
