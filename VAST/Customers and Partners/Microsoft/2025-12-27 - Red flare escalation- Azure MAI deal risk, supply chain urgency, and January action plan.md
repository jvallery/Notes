# Red flare escalation: Azure MAI deal risk, supply chain urgency, and January action plan

**Date**: 2025-12-27

**Account**: [[Microsoft]]

**Attendees**: Jeff Denworth, Jonsi Stefansson, Lior Genzel, Rick Scurfield, Renen Hallak, Myself

## Summary

Jeff Denworth escalated concern that VAST is losing probability of closing a Q1 deal with Microsoft Azure MAI due to slow execution, lack of commercial engagement, and supply chain constraints. Jonsi Stefansson reported Microsoft contacts (Aung and Maneesh) expect a VAST integration proposal with Azure Blob and that an engineering workshop in Redmond is being planned for January, but Microsoft supply chain contacts are out until January 5th.


## Action Items


- [?] Sync with Jonsi Stefansson to draft and deliver the VAST integration proposal with Azure Blob requested by Microsoft contacts Aung and Maneesh. @Myself 📅 2025-12-30 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Determine Microsoft Azure MAI supply chain status and constraints (allocation, timelines, sourcing) to guide VAST deal strategy, as requested by Jeff Denworth. @Jonsi Stefansson 📅 2026-01-05 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Plan for either Lior Genzel or Jonsi Stefansson to be physically in Redmond, Washington immediately after the start of 2026 to begin commercial discussions with Microsoft Azure MAI stakeholders. @TBD 📅 2026-01-06 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Set up an engineering workshop in Redmond, Washington in January 2026 with Microsoft to review VAST integration, including Azure Blob integration expectations. @Jonsi Stefansson 📅 2026-01-15 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Initiate real supply chain and build planning conversations with Microsoft Azure MAI stakeholders by the second week of January 2026, per Jeff Denworth milestone plan. @TBD 📅 2026-01-17 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule Renen Hallak to be in Redmond, Washington by the third week of January 2026 to meet with a Microsoft stakeholder referred to as 'Scott G' to align on the first tranche and scaling plan for Azure MAI with VAST. @TBD 📅 2026-01-24 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Establish a daily update cadence for the Microsoft Azure MAI deal execution and communicate status to Jeff Denworth and the deal team. @TBD 📅 2026-01-02 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Jeff Denworth proposed an execution plan for the Microsoft Azure MAI deal with explicit January 2026 milestones (Redmond presence early January, supply chain/build conversations by second week, executive alignment by third week, paperwork last week) and stated missing milestones implies zero probability of closing.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft Azure MAI needs 2 exabytes of storage capacity on the floor within the year 2025, creating urgency for early hardware and software decisions due to supply chain constraints.

- Jeff Denworth stated VAST likely cannot rely on Arrow or Avnet supply chain to support the Microsoft Azure MAI scale natively due to global supply chain turmoil.

- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft has a large hardware allocation across Azure but is still in a difficult supply chain position for the Azure MAI buildout.

- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft is considering HDDs for the first April 2026 delivery for Azure MAI scale-up, and that HDD supply is also constrained.

- Jeff Denworth stated testing at CoreWeave for the Azure MAI effort has not started in earnest as of 2025-12-27.

- Jeff Denworth stated VAST has not started commercial discussions with Microsoft about the Azure MAI deal as of 2025-12-27.

- Jeff Denworth stated that during the first CoreWeave deal, VAST had Andy Bernstein and an individual named Leo working out of CoreWeave offices daily, and that approach has netted $1.5B in bookings so far.

- Jonsi Stefansson stated he met with Microsoft contacts named Aung and Maneesh, and they expect VAST to deliver an integration proposal with Azure Blob.

- Jonsi Stefansson stated he and Jason Vallery planned to sync on the Azure Blob integration proposal on 2025-12-29 or 2025-12-30.

- Jonsi Stefansson stated VAST plans to set up an engineering workshop in Redmond, Washington in January 2026 related to Microsoft Azure MAI integration work.

- Jonsi Stefansson stated he emailed Microsoft contacts to understand Microsoft supply chain status and platform needs, but received out-of-office replies indicating they return on 2026-01-05.

- Jeff Denworth requested more active communication and suggested moving to daily updates for the Microsoft Azure MAI deal execution starting 2026-01-01.
