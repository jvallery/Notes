# Azure MAI deal risk escalation, supply chain constraints, and January execution plan

**Date**: 2025-12-27

**Account**: [[Microsoft]]

**Attendees**: Jeff Denworth, Jonsi Stefansson, Lior Genzel, Rick Scurfield, Renen Hallak, Jason Vallery, Unknown Microsoft contact (Aung), Maneesh Sah, Unknown Microsoft contact (Scott G), Andy Bernstein, Leo

## Summary

Jeff Denworth escalated risk that VAST will miss a Q1 Microsoft Azure MAI deal due to slow execution, lack of commercial engagement, and global supply chain constraints. He proposed an aggressive January plan including on-site presence in Redmond, supply chain and build conversations by the second week of January, executive alignment by the third week, and paperwork in the last week of January.


## Action Items


- [?] Sync with Jonsi Stefansson to draft and align on the VAST integration proposal for Azure Blob requested by Microsoft contacts Aung and Maneesh Sah. @Myself 📅 2025-12-30 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Determine Microsoft MAI supply chain position (hardware allocation, storage media availability, procurement constraints) and report back to Jeff Denworth to guide deal strategy. @Jonsi Stefansson 📅 2026-01-05 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Determine Microsoft MAI supply chain position (hardware allocation, storage media availability, procurement constraints) and report back to Jeff Denworth to guide deal strategy. @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-05 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Set up an engineering workshop in Redmond in January 2026 focused on VAST integration with Azure Blob for Microsoft MAI stakeholders. @Jonsi Stefansson 📅 2026-01-10 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Ensure a VAST leader (either Lior Genzel or Jonsi Stefansson) is physically in Redmond immediately after the start of 2026 to begin commercial conversations with Microsoft MAI. @TBD 📅 2026-01-06 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Begin real supply chain and build planning conversations with Microsoft MAI stakeholders to support a January first order, per Jeff Denworth’s milestone plan. @TBD 📅 2026-01-16 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule Renen Hallak to be in Redmond in the third week of January 2026 to meet with a Microsoft stakeholder identified as 'Scott G' to align philosophically on the first tranche and scaling plan for MAI with VAST. @Renen Hallak 📅 2026-01-23 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Establish a daily update cadence to improve internal communication and execution tracking for the Microsoft MAI deal, as requested by Jeff Denworth. @TBD 📅 2026-01-02 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Jeff Denworth proposed an execution approach for Microsoft MAI that requires on-site presence in Redmond immediately after the start of the new year to begin commercial conversations, rather than attempting to close remotely from Israel or Iceland.

- Jeff Denworth proposed treating CoreWeave testing as largely cosmetic and focusing execution on supply chain, build planning, and commercial closure steps to enable a January first order.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated he is rapidly losing confidence that VAST will close a Q1 deal with Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) unless VAST becomes more aggressive and executes faster.

- Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) needs 2 exabytes (2EB) of storage capacity deployed on the floor within the current year (as stated by Jeff Denworth).

- Jeff Denworth stated global supply chain turmoil likely prevents VAST from supporting the MAI scale natively via Arrow or Avnet supply chain channels.

- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft has a large hardware allocation across Azure but is still in a difficult supply chain position.

- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft is considering HDDs for the first April delivery for MAI scale-up, and that HDD supply is also constrained.

- Jeff Denworth stated testing at CoreWeave for this MAI-related effort has not started in earnest.

- Jeff Denworth stated VAST has not started commercial discussions with Microsoft about the MAI deal at the time of his email.

- Jeff Denworth asserted that Microsoft must order hardware early to utilize GPUs quickly, and therefore must decide on storage software early because each software choice materially impacts the overall hardware purchase.

- Jeff Denworth stated that VAST is the most infrastructure-efficient storage option for Microsoft MAI at scale and that VAST should push to make that outcome happen.

- Jeff Denworth asked Jonsi Stefansson and Lior Genzel to get much smarter on Microsoft’s supply chain position, and noted there was no update yet as of 2025-12-27.

- Jonsi Stefansson reported he met with Microsoft contacts Aung and Maneesh Sah, and they expect an integration proposal from VAST for Azure Blob integration.

- Jonsi Stefansson stated he and Jason Vallery planned to sync on the Azure Blob integration proposal on 2025-12-29 or 2025-12-30.

- Jonsi Stefansson stated he emailed multiple Microsoft contacts to understand Microsoft supply chain status and platform needs, and received out-of-office replies indicating returns on 2026-01-05.

- Jeff Denworth suggested moving to daily updates because he believes the team is not communicating actively enough while Azure continues selling.

- Jeff Denworth referenced a prior CoreWeave deal where Andy Bernstein and an individual named Leo worked out of CoreWeave offices daily, which Jeff stated has netted $1.5B in bookings so far.
