# Microsoft requests Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing, VAST declines due to readiness

**Date**: 2025-12-11
**Account**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Ray Coetzee, Lior Genzel, Karl Vietmeier, Jason Vallery

## Summary

Microsoft is testing a physical VAST PoC system in Microsoft's Redmond lab but lacks GPU nodes in the lab, so they requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU VMs. Lior Genzel directed Ray Coetzee to schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft team and stated VAST will decline the request because VAST Azure is not ready for this use case.


## Action Items


- [?] Schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft team who requested an Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing, so VAST can communicate the decision to decline. @Ray Coetzee ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide guidance on how VAST should approach Microsoft's request for an Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing (requested by Ray Coetzee). @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Define the expected performance profile for a VAST Azure VoC instance (question raised by Ray Coetzee). @Karl Vietmeier #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- VAST will not provide an Azure VoC instance to Microsoft for performance testing against Azure GPU instances because VAST Azure is not ready for this use case.




## Key Information


- Microsoft has a physical VAST PoC system installed in Microsoft's lab in Redmond and is actively testing it.

- Microsoft's Redmond lab does not currently have GPU nodes available for testing.

- Microsoft requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing using Azure GPU instances because their on-prem lab lacks GPU nodes.

- Lior Genzel stated VAST will respond 'no' to providing an Azure VoC instance for Microsoft testing because VAST Azure is not close to being ready for this use case.

- Ray Coetzee asked Karl Vietmeier to define the expected performance profile for an Azure VoC instance.

- Lior Genzel told Karl Vietmeier that Karl is optional on the follow-up call with Microsoft Azure because Lior plans to block the Azure VoC request.
