# Microsoft requests Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing, VAST declines due to readiness

**Date**: 2025-12-11

**Account**: [[Microsoft]]

**Attendees**: Ray Coetzee, Lior Genzel, Karl Vietmeier, Myself

## Summary

Ray Coetzee reported that Microsoft is testing a physical VAST PoC system in Microsoft's Redmond lab but lacks GPU nodes, so Microsoft requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU VMs. Lior Genzel directed Ray to schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft requestors and stated the answer will be no because VAST Azure is not ready for this use case.


## Action Items


- [?] Suggest and schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft team who requested an Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing, so Lior Genzel can communicate that VAST will not provide the Azure VoC. @Ray Coetzee ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Join the internal discussion if needed and align with Lior Genzel and Ray Coetzee on the response to Microsoft's request for an Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing. @Myself #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- VAST will not provide an Azure VoC instance to Microsoft for performance testing against Azure GPU instances because VAST Azure is not ready for this use case.




## Key Information


- Microsoft has a physical VAST Proof of Concept (PoC) system installed in Microsoft's lab in Redmond and Microsoft is actively testing it.

- Microsoft's Redmond lab currently does not have GPU nodes available, which prompted Microsoft to request an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU virtual machines.

- Lior Genzel stated that VAST Azure is not close to being ready to be used for Microsoft's requested Azure VoC performance testing scenario.

- Lior Genzel intends to block Microsoft's request for an Azure VoC instance and communicate the refusal directly on a follow-up call.
