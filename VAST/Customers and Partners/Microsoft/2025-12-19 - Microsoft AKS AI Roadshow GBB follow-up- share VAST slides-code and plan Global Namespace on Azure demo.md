# Microsoft AKS AI Roadshow (GBB) follow-up: share VAST slides/code and plan Global Namespace on Azure demo

**Date**: 2025-12-19

**Account**: [[Microsoft]]

**Attendees**: Tiffany Stonehill, Mohamad Al Jazaery, Kurt Niebuhr, Lior Genzel, Myself, Chris Carpenter, Kent Altena, Sooyoung Moon, Andrew Thomas, Sheila Mueller, Yuval Mazor, Alan Weaver, Zack Soenen

## Summary

After VAST presented VAST + AKS to Microsoft Global Black Belt (GBB) AI infrastructure sellers on Tuesday, December 9, 2025, Microsoft requested the slides and code from the session and asked about a Global Namespace on Azure demo/accelerator for the AI roadshow. Tiffany Stonehill proposed syncing on pipeline and coordinating slide/access delivery with Jason Vallery, while Lior Genzel recommended a Global Namespace burst-to-Azure demo path and asked to schedule a call to integrate it into the roadshow.
