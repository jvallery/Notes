# Jason VAST role exploration

**Date**: 2025-09-16
**Account**: [[Microsoft]]
**Attendees**: Lior Genzel, Jason Vallery

## Summary

Intro call to explore Jason Vallery joining VAST, with Lior outlining potential fits (Azure/hyperscalers GTM, model builders GTM, or CTO Office). Key discussion centered on VAST’s cloud GTM plans on Azure (including Microsoft Lifter) and the major adoption risk of cloud egress/networking costs, with ExpressRoute Direct Local proposed as a mitigation path. They agreed to proceed with a formal interview process and initially lean toward placing Jason on the Azure business/BD lead track with a strong technical counterpart.

## Decisions
- Proceed with interviews for Jason at VAST.
- Initial leaning to focus Jason on Azure GTM/business side (strategic relationships/BD) rather than cross-cloud, with option to expand scope later.

## Key Information
- Jason has ~13 years at Microsoft Azure Storage and led major AI storage engagements including OpenAI; recently moved into an architect role after a sabbatical.
- VAST signed Microsoft Lifter and is investing heavily in cloud GTM, scaling the team from 1 to 10–15+ people.
- Potential org fits discussed: Jay’s model builders GTM, Lior’s hyperscalers/Azure GTM, or CTO Office (cross-cloud).
- Cloud GA plan discussed: GCP in October, AWS MVP in December, Azure GA in February; additional Azure Lifter-related milestone around September next year.
- Microsoft has internal regret about ANF/NetApp-style partnerships due to single-vendor dependency and margin sharing; similar sentiment mentioned regarding Databricks.
- Network egress fees and cross-region/multi-cloud data movement are a major risk; ExpressRoute Direct Local proposed as a fixed-price high-bandwidth option used by CDN providers.
- VAST is building a SaaS on Azure (initially managed cluster in customer tenant, then own-tenant SaaS) and is pushing toward potential 1P service and/or M&A interest.
- Neocloud adoption is strong per discussion; NVIDIA DGX Cloud blueprint reportedly favors VAST outside hyperscalers.
- Compensation: Jason is flexible on structure if equity upside is meaningful; prefers not to materially reduce quality of life.
