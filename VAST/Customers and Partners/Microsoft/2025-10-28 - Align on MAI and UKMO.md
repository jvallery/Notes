# Align on MAI and UKMO

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Account**: [[Microsoft]]
**Attendees**: Jason Vallery, Kanchan Mehrotra

## Summary

Jason and Kanchan aligned to prioritize Microsoft AI (MAI) and the UK Met Office as flagship customer wins to drive Azure toward a better hardware/storage shape for VAST, since current Azure LSV4 economics and networking are not viable at scale and LSV5 is far out. They agreed on a dual-track approach: progress an Azure Marketplace offer while simultaneously using marquee customer pull (MAI/UKMO) to escalate requirements with Igal’s team and internal stakeholders (e.g., Nidhi). Supercomputing/Ignite coordination (panel/booth/keynote slide) and exploration of Neo-cloud GPU-adjacent storage and VAST KV-store opportunities were also discussed.
## Action Items
- [ ] Meet with MAI (Kushal) and gather requirements/next steps; report back to Kanchan. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Connect with Vipin Sachdeva to re-open MAI conversation and align with Kushal. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Build an economics deck comparing 1EB across VAST on LSV4, LSV5, on-prem, and Azure Blob (HDD/Flash) for internal NDA sharing. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Share MAI meeting notes with Kanchan and propose a joint plan. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Engage Igal to discuss LSV5 shape, networking needs, and customer-driven pipeline (MAI, UK Met Office). @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Meet UK Met Office leaders (Mike Kiernan, Nico, Alan) at Supercomputing to push the VAST approach. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Coordinate Supercomputing/Ignite joint story and VAST booth content with Kanchan, Lior, and Andrew. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Set up a session with Nidhi to review MAI + UK Met Office case and the economics deck (post-Supercomputing if needed). @Kanchan 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Confirm whether Suresh will attend Supercomputing and, if yes, schedule a discussion on Neo-cloud GPU-adjacent storage. @Kanchan 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Advance the Azure Marketplace offer with Yancey’s team (control plane integration, listing, billing). @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Sync next week after the MAI Friday call to decide the support plan. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Check with Lior on outcomes from dinner with Igal and capture any asks. @Myself 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task
- [ ] Verify Nidhi’s availability (Supercomputing or post-Supercomputing) and confirm a meeting. @Kanchan 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Confirm Wave’s current GPU status and whether a VAST proposal is viable on Azure. @Kanchan 📅 2025-11-08 🔽 #task
- [ ] Validate UK Met Office networking constraints vs planned LSV5 with Igal’s team. @Kanchan 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task

## Decisions
- Near-term focus on MAI and UK Met Office over a broad sales motion.
- Pursue a dual-track approach: marketplace listing plus flagship customer escalations.
- Use Nidhi to re-energize internal advocacy once the story and offer are ready.

## Key Information
- GPU supply constraints are limiting third-party (3P) deals; demand remains high.
- Azure LSV4 is the only current option but has too many cores, weak networking, low drive density, and poor $/performance at scale.
- LSV5 is committed by Igal’s team but is far out and may still be bandwidth-limited for UK Met Office needs.
- VAST density claim: ~1EB can be ~20 VAST racks vs ~240 Azure Blob racks; power can be ~1/5 in MAI Falcon-type clusters.
- Azure Storage is unlikely to champion VAST due to conflict of interest; support likely needs to come via Igal’s team and marquee customer pull.
- Marketplace control plane integration is in progress; Google first, Azure targeted around February (year not specified).
- MAI already has CoreWeave capacity and VAST capacity exists there; MAI interest in VAST on Azure remains.
- Neo-cloud GPU-adjacent storage is positioned to keep GPUs productive during network disconnects; a GPU-to-local-storage ratio is a key design point.
- VAST has a high-performance KV-store (Undivided Attention) relevant to long-term memory workloads; Microsoft previously declined to build a similar capability.
