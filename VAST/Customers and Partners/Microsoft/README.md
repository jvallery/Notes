# Microsoft

## Key Facts

- Microsoft's internal "Big Pause" on AI infrastructure capacity is described as over, and Microsoft is scrambling for near-term capacity across self-build, leases, and neocloud providers.

- Microsoft's monetization thesis is that tokens and APIs are more important than IaaS, positioning Azure Foundry as a "token factory".

- Nvidia is described as the current workhorse accelerator for Microsoft AI infrastructure, while Microsoft's MAIA accelerator is described as lagging; Microsoft may use OpenAI's ASIC.

- On 2025-10-28, Microsoft disclosed an updated Microsoft-OpenAI agreement: Azure API exclusivity for OpenAI continues; Microsoft IP rights are extended to 2032; research IP access ends by an AGI panel decision or 2030; OpenAI will purchase more than $250B of Azure services; there is no right-of-first-refusal for Microsoft; and both parties can independently pursue AGI.

- The updated Microsoft-OpenAI agreement both locks in Azure demand (via OpenAI's Azure services commitment) and loosens operational exclusivity constraints (via removal of right-of-first-refusal).

- SemiAnalysis claims post-training compute (RL/SFT/mid-training) is ramping quickly and is relatively latency-insensitive, enabling placement in remote data centers; Microsoft’s fleet is described as fungible.

- SemiAnalysis claims the economic life of GPUs in Microsoft's fleet extends beyond a 2-3 year cycle, implying long-lived clusters with continual data growth needs (checkpoints, logs, evals, datasets).

- VAST positioning recommended for Microsoft: VAST as the fastest route to usable capacity for OpenAI-related and Azure Foundry tenants, emphasizing consistent performance, simplified operations, and cross-cloud data mobility when Azure backfills from neoclouds.

## Topics

- Microsoft AI infrastructure capacity: end of "Big Pause" and near-term capacity sourcing via self-build, leases, and neoclouds

- Azure Foundry monetization strategy: tokens and APIs prioritized over IaaS

- Accelerator roadmap uncertainty: Nvidia dominance, MAIA lag, potential OpenAI ASIC usage

- Microsoft-OpenAI partnership update (2025-10-28): exclusivity, IP rights, research IP sunset, $250B+ Azure commitment, no ROFR, independent AGI pursuit

- Workload mix shift: training vs post-training/inference, remote DC placement, long-lived GPU clusters and sustained storage growth

- Microsoft Azure networking and egress minimization strategy for VAST Data offerings (ExpressRoute Direct Local)

- Azure GA milestone validation and alignment with Microsoft Lifter program phases (Feb GA vs Sep first-party milestone)

- Compliance and permissions for using Microsoft data in ROI comparisons

- Sales enablement collateral for Microsoft discussions (LSv4, LSv5, OEM/ODM, Azure storage comparison slide)

## Key Decisions

- No explicit decisions were recorded in the provided transcript notes; the content is guidance and implications rather than meeting decisions.

- For VAST Data's Azure offerings, prioritize a networking engagement plan that minimizes egress costs, including evaluating ExpressRoute Direct Local.

- Align VAST Data's Azure GA planning with Microsoft Lifter program phases, explicitly tracking February GA versus September first-party milestone timing.

- Before sharing ROI comparison materials with Microsoft stakeholders (including Nidhi, last name not provided), validate which Microsoft-provided data is permitted for use.
