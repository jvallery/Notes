# Microsoft

## Key Facts

- Microsoft's internal "Big Pause" on AI infrastructure capacity is described as over, and Microsoft is scrambling for near-term capacity across self-build, leases, and neocloud providers.

- Microsoft's monetization thesis is that tokens and APIs are more important than IaaS, positioning Azure Foundry as a "token factory".

- Nvidia is described as the current workhorse accelerator for Microsoft AI infrastructure, while Microsoft's MAIA accelerator is described as lagging; Microsoft may use OpenAI's ASIC.

- On 2025-10-28, Microsoft disclosed an updated Microsoft-OpenAI agreement: Azure API exclusivity for OpenAI continues; Microsoft IP rights are extended to 2032; research IP access ends by an AGI panel decision or 2030; OpenAI will purchase more than $250B of Azure services; there is no right-of-first-refusal for Microsoft; and both parties can independently pursue AGI.

- The updated Microsoft-OpenAI agreement both locks in Azure demand (via OpenAI's Azure services commitment) and loosens operational exclusivity constraints (via removal of right-of-first-refusal).

- SemiAnalysis claims post-training compute (RL/SFT/mid-training) is ramping quickly and is relatively latency-insensitive, enabling placement in remote data centers; Microsoft’s fleet is described as fungible.

- SemiAnalysis claims the economic life of GPUs in Microsoft's fleet extends beyond a 2-3 year cycle, implying long-lived clusters with continual data growth needs (checkpoints, logs, evals, datasets).

- VAST positioning recommended for Microsoft: VAST as the fastest route to usable capacity for OpenAI-related and Azure Foundry tenants, emphasizing consistent performance, simplified operations, and cross-cloud data mobility when Azure backfills from neoclouds.

- Jay Parikh is EVP for CoreAI at Microsoft and is participating in Roland's CES keynote on January 6, 2026; VAST wants to meet him while in Las Vegas.

- Jeff Denworth stated that if Microsoft MAI wants to deploy in April 2026, May 2026, or June 2026, VAST needs a plan immediately because nothing is reserved for Microsoft.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal said MAI's initial GPU drop will arrive in February 2026 and MAI needs a storage solution ready for the May 2026 to June 2026 timeframe, and that January 2026 is no longer a hard date.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal said MAI will decide on the storage deployment and that Kushal told Manish that Azure Blob compared to VAST does not make sense for MAI requirements.

- Jeff Denworth asked whether VAST is tracking Microsoft MAI requirements with VAST Operations and whether VAST can deliver within the tight timeframe.

- Peter Imming and Jason Vallery previously worked together at Microsoft, where Peter Imming was Jason Vallery's manager.

- Microsoft has a physical VAST Data proof-of-concept system installed in Microsoft's lab in Redmond and is actively testing it.

- Microsoft's Redmond lab currently does not have GPU nodes available for testing.

- Microsoft requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU instances because their lab lacks GPU nodes.

- VAST Data presented 'VAST + AKS' to Microsoft Global Black Belt (GBB) AI infrastructure sellers as part of the AKS AI Roadshow on Tuesday, December 9, 2025 from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM via Microsoft Teams.

- Whale Iptic described a multi-pod architecture running across AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure to reduce disruption risk from a single cloud provider outage.

- Adem Sefa (Microsoft) initiated an introduction to Jason Vallery for a finance candidate (Edwin Trogler).

- Azure Blob is described as the persistence layer for OpenAI's Rockset-based online data platform.

- Azure Cosmos DB is described as heavily used by OpenAI for conversation persistence.

- The document 'VAST and Azure Integration.docx' relates to VAST Data integration with Microsoft Azure.

- Microsoft is the external party to follow up with regarding pricing for the MAI unified cache initiative.

- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) needs 2 exabytes (2EB) of storage capacity deployed ('on the floor') in calendar year 2025.

- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft has a large hardware allocation across Azure but is still in a bad supply chain position.

- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft is considering HDDs for the first April 2026 delivery for MAI scale-up, and that HDD supply is also constrained.

- Jeff Denworth asserted Microsoft must order hardware early to ensure GPUs are utilized quickly, and therefore must decide on storage software early because software choice materially impacts hardware purchase decisions.

- Jonsi Stephenson stated he met with Microsoft contacts Aung (last name unknown) and Maneesh Sah, and they expect an integration proposal from VAST for Azure Blob Storage integration.

- Jonsi Stephenson stated he sent emails to Microsoft contacts to understand their supply chain position and platform needs, but received out-of-office replies indicating they return on 2026-01-05.

- Microsoft was listed as a topic for an AlphaSights expert discussion request to Jason Vallery.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal said MAI's initial GPU drop will arrive in February 2026 and MAI needs a storage solution ready for May to June 2026; January 2026 is no longer a hard date.

- Lior Genzel reported that Kushal said MAI will decide on the storage deployment and told Manish that Azure Blob does not make sense versus VAST for MAI requirements.

- Lior Genzel stated that the Microsoft work with Trevor Cooper-Chadwick is an engineering-level proof of concept (PoC) and Microsoft is not yet a VAST customer for this effort.

- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft is also in a poor supply chain position but has a large allocation across Azure, and Microsoft is considering HDDs for the first April MAI scale-up delivery even though HDD supply is also constrained.

## Key Decisions

- No explicit decisions were recorded in the provided transcript notes; the content is guidance and implications rather than meeting decisions.

- For VAST Data's Azure offerings, prioritize a networking engagement plan that minimizes egress costs, including evaluating ExpressRoute Direct Local.

- Align VAST Data's Azure GA planning with Microsoft Lifter program phases, explicitly tracking February GA versus September first-party milestone timing.

- Before sharing ROI comparison materials with Microsoft stakeholders (including Nidhi, last name not provided), validate which Microsoft-provided data is permitted for use.

- Lior Genzel decided to connect Jason Vallery and Sushant Rewaskar via a quick intro call to enable technical collaboration between VAST Data and Microsoft.

- Trevor Cooper-Chadwick's VAST Customer Learning Portal access request will remain pending approval until Lior Genzel confirms Trevor's objectives and whether access is appropriate for an engineering-level PoC.

- VAST Data will not provide an Azure VoC instance to Microsoft for performance testing against Azure GPU instances because VAST Azure is not ready for this use case.

- Pipeline sync between Tiffany Stonehill (VAST Data) and Mohamad Al Jazaery (Microsoft) will be scheduled in January 2026 because Mohamad is out for the next two weeks.

- Karl Rautenstrauch tentatively moved the Weekly VAST GTM Meeting from Monday, January 5, 2026 to Tuesday of that week, pending VAST team preference for Wednesday or Thursday.

- Jeff Denworth proposed shifting VAST's operating assumption to treat CoreWeave testing for Microsoft MAI as largely cosmetic and to prioritize immediate commercial and supply chain execution to enable a January 2026 first order.

- Trevor Cooper-Chadwick's VAST Customer Learning Portal access request will remain pending approval until Lior Genzel confirms objectives and provides guidance.

- VAST will not provide an Azure VoC instance to Microsoft for GPU performance testing because VAST Azure is not ready for this use case.

- Pipeline sync between Tiffany Stonehill (VAST Data) and Mohamad Al Jazaery (Microsoft) will be scheduled in January 2026 because Mohamad Al Jazaery is out for the next two weeks as of 2025-12-19.

- Lior Genzel will be the point person for the latest engineering status on showcasing VAST Global Namespace on Azure.

- Karl Rautenstrauch tentatively moved the Weekly VAST GTM Meeting from Monday, 2026-01-05 to Tuesday of that week, pending VAST confirmation if Wednesday or Thursday is preferable.
