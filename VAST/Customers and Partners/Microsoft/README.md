## Key Facts

- Google Distributed Cloud has connected and air-gapped variants; NetApp is the incumbent storage partner.
- Google issued a US-based RFP to replace NetApp for GDC storage; VAST was invited to respond and is undergoing vendor due diligence.
- Google’s emphasis areas include air-gapped support, compliance/attestations (e.g., DISA STIG), ops model (updates, staffing, troubleshooting), multi-tenancy, quotas, encryption, and tags.
- Fort Meade "Gemini as a service" on-prem initiative is described as a Q4 commit and a near-term joint validation path.
- GDC deployments commonly run on Dell; HPE and Cisco are also in scope for hardware options.
- VAST recently launched Google Marketplace offers; broader partnership is still early.
- Resource risk: Greg may be heavily focused on Leidos next year, potentially impacting continuity.
- Google Z3 exists; Z4M is the next storage-serving VM with higher storage and network density.
- Z4M targets storage-serving use cases; CPU/RAM may be overprovisioned but pricing optimization is planned.
- Google is developing a Google Supercomputer (GSC) interface to provision AI/HPC infrastructure with co-placement optimization; VAST could be integrated as a selectable storage option with potential auto-deploy.

## Topics

Google Distributed Cloud RFP response strategy, Air-gapped/dark-site readiness and operational support model, Compliance evidence, certifications, and ATO considerations, Hardware platform options (Dell/HPE/Cisco) vs commodity VM shapes, RDMA and VM shape tradeoffs, Fort Meade on-prem Gemini validation path, Coordination between Google corporate GDC and Google Federal teams, Joint federal account alignment and co-selling, Google Marketplace offers and broader partnership tracks, TPU/model-builder partnership track, Z4M storage-serving VM roadmap (density, pricing optimization), Local SSD vs HyperDisk vs object storage tiers (latency/economics), Google Supercomputer (GSC) provisioning, co-placement, and partner integration, RDMA and GPUDirect Storage (A5X GPUs) and TPU RDMA timeline, Anywhere Cache (cost vs performance)

## Opportunities

- Azure offerings engagement plan focused on minimizing egress
- Marketplace L-series offer complement via higher-density SKUs or OEM hardware path
- BizDev enablement (density/power, single-namespace story) and introductions
- "New Azure" project under Qi/Brenden (details incomplete)
- MAI/Apollo wedge to standardize VAST as storage for single-tenant GPU-dense sites; focus on performance and GPU utilization wins
- Long-game Azure hardware qualification path and potential liquid-cooled storage SKU exploration with ODM
- Clarify ownership and convert sales asks into product requirements where appropriate
- Azure Extended Zones storage alignment (post-A2N approval)
- Managed Lustre performance/TCO review with Microsoft performance lead.
- Context: Azure Blob positioned as 'cold' tier in OpenAI tiering vocabulary; Azure/network vagaries are a driver for the VAST warm-storage adjacency pitch

## Blockers

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Greg Castellucci will run point with Google Federal and coordinate with the corporate GDC team over the next few weeks.
- ✅ Jason Vallery will coordinate RFP content assembly and connect Greg with Google stakeholders.
- ✅ Alon Horev will conduct a 1:1 with Muninder Singh Sambi focused on AI, VM shapes/RDMA, and hardware tradeoffs.
- ✅ Leo will own the end-to-end formal RFP response and submission.
- ✅ Use the Fort Meade on-prem Gemini initiative as the primary near-term validation path/reference.
- ✅ Include Dell and HPE SKU recommendations and consider Cisco/commodity VM options in the architecture proposal.
- ✅ Proceed with local SSD-based Z4M for initial VAST on GCP; evaluate object/HyperDisk tiers later.
- ✅ Coordinate in-person sessions at Supercomputing and include key GCP stakeholders (Ilyas, Dean).
- ✅ Proceed with setting up a CEO-level introduction to Jai Menon.
- ✅ Evaluate use case fit per customer: accelerate production DB vs near-real-time cloned copies.
