## Key Facts

- Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) capacity constraints and supply chain urgency drive near-term engagement and escalation.
- Two-track patterns recur: (1) marketplace/procurement paths, and (2) performance-first platform/hardware validation paths.
- Azure storage-hardware-led integration (including Blob API compatibility and/or bare-metal deployment patterns) shows up as a recurring product and political theme.
- Internal stakeholder mapping and sequencing matter (MAI, Azure Storage, exec alignment, and the right technical sponsors).

## Topics

- MAI: exabyte-scale storage needs, timelines, and execution risks
- Azure integration: Blob API/AzCopy compatibility and ecosystem expectations
- Marketplace/procurement: offers, VoC requests, and access gating
