## Key Decisions

- (2025-12-16) Do not allow access to the portal for Trevor Cooper-Chadwick until further notice.

- (2025-12-21) Kushal made it clear that MAI will decide on the storage deployment.

- (2025-12-21) Renen will meet flash vendors and cannot change dates.

- (2025-12-27) Assume CoreWeave testing is largely a cosmetic exercise.

- (2026-01-04) Reschedule the meeting to Tuesday for now.

- Kristin Thompson will keep Trevor Cooper-Chadwick's VAST Customer Learning Portal access request in 'pending approval' status until Lior Genzel confirms objectives and provides guidance.

- Pipeline sync between Microsoft (Mohamad Al Jazaery, Kurt Niebuhr) and VAST Data (Tiffany Stonehill) will be scheduled in January 2026 due to Mohamad Al Jazaery being out for the next two weeks starting 2025-12-19.

- VAST Global Namespace on Azure demo/accelerator planning and status updates will be handled by Lior Genzel as the VAST point of contact with the latest engineering updates.

- VAST will not provide an Azure VoC instance to Microsoft for performance testing against Azure GPU instances because VAST Azure is not ready for this use case.

- Karl Rautenstrauch tentatively rescheduled the Weekly VAST GTM Meeting to Tuesday for the week of 2026-01-05, pending VAST confirmation if Wednesday or Thursday is preferable.
