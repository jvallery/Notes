## Key Facts

- Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) capacity constraints and supply chain urgency drive near-term engagement and escalation.
- Two-track patterns recur: (1) marketplace/procurement paths, and (2) performance-first platform/hardware validation paths.
- Azure storage-hardware-led integration (including Blob API compatibility and/or bare-metal deployment patterns) shows up as a recurring product and political theme.
- Internal stakeholder mapping and sequencing matter (MAI, Azure Storage, exec alignment, and the right technical sponsors).

- The document title "VAST and Azure Integration.docx" indicates the content is related to Microsoft Azure integration.

- VAST expects Microsoft to request extensive competitive and pricing diligence, including comparisons to CoreWeave and potentially whether CoreWeave is considered a competitor.

- VAST is preparing a Microsoft-facing TCO model that includes COGS, power, and opportunity cost/value of lower power consumption to Microsoft.

- The meeting topic includes pricing related to Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI).

- Whale Iptic was described as running a multi-pod architecture across Microsoft Azure as part of a multi-cloud reliability strategy.

- Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) training project at the Nebius New Jersey data center is planned to scale to an 812 x 812 full-scale deployment.

- The Microsoft MAI Nebius NJ deployment is designed to be installed in phases, with the first phase requiring hardware for one hall and a 58 x 58 setup.

- Latest update shared by Lior Genzel: Microsoft expects to install the first hall of the Nebius NJ MAI project in the May/June 2026 timeframe, then move aggressively to the other 13 halls before the end of 2026.

- VAST triggered urgency with Microsoft MAI due to severe supply chain constraints and started a parallel evaluation of whether the deployment can be done on Microsoft hardware (Azure Blob or Azure Compute) or using Microsoft NAND supply chain.

- Azure Local is being discussed as a potential VAST Data support area tied to hyperscaler acquisition and cloud consumption.

- Microsoft Global Black Belt (GBB) AI infrastructure sellers hosted a Microsoft Teams session where VAST Data presented VAST + AKS on Tuesday, December 9, 2025 from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM.

- The Weekly VAST GTM Meeting was originally scheduled for Monday, January 5, 2026 from 9:30 AM to 10:05 AM as a Microsoft Teams meeting.

- A Microsoft contact (Karl Rautenstrauch) canceled a Weekly VAST GTM Meeting on 2026-01-05 and planned to reconnect later in the week.

- Microsoft is a key engagement topic in the Weekly VAST GTM Meeting agenda, including engagement status and marketplace onboarding blockers.

- Microsoft MAI's initial GPU drop is expected in February 2026 and Microsoft needs a storage solution ready for May 2026 to June 2026, per Kushal Datta as relayed by Lior Genzel.

- Microsoft MAI will decide on the storage deployment, and Kushal Datta told Manish Sah that Azure Blob does not make sense compared to VAST for MAI requirements, per Lior Genzel.

- VAST Data currently has no inventory reserved for Microsoft for the MAI effort, per Jeff Denworth.

- Adem Sefa works at Microsoft as Managing Director, Strategic Partnerships.

- Microsoft has a physical VAST proof-of-concept (PoC) system installed in Microsoft's lab in Redmond and Microsoft is actively testing it.

- Microsoft's Redmond lab does not currently have GPU nodes available for testing.

- Microsoft requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU instances because their Redmond lab lacks GPU nodes.

## Key Decisions

- Trevor Cooper-Chadwick's request for VAST Customer Learning Portal access will remain pending until Lior Genzel confirms Trevor's objectives and whether access is appropriate for a prospect in an engineering-level PoC.

- Procurement decision for the Microsoft MAI Nebius NJ first-hall deployment is between VAST Data and Azure Blob (Microsoft's original plan).

- Target to reach a decision in the coming business days to enable a procurement decision before the end of January 2026.

- Lior Genzel recommended positioning the AI roadshow demo around VAST Global Namespace enabling VAST on-premises customers to burst into Microsoft Azure.

- Karl Rautenstrauch tentatively moved the Weekly VAST GTM Meeting to Tuesday (exact date and time not specified in the email) pending VAST team confirmation if Wednesday or Thursday is better.

- VAST will not provide an Azure VoC instance to Microsoft for Azure GPU performance testing because VAST Azure is not ready for this use case (decision communicated by Lior Genzel on 2025-12-11).
