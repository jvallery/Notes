- BizDev enablement (density/power, single-namespace story) and introductions
- "New Azure" project under Qi/Brenden (details incomplete)
- MAI/Apollo wedge to standardize VAST as storage for single-tenant GPU-dense sites; focus on performance and GPU utilization wins
- Long-game Azure hardware qualification path and potential liquid-cooled storage SKU exploration with ODM
- Clarify ownership and convert sales asks into product requirements where appropriate
- Azure Extended Zones storage alignment (post-A2N approval)
- Managed Lustre performance/TCO review with Microsoft performance lead.
