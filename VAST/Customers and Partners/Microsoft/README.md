## Key Facts

- Microsoft’s 'Big Pause' is over; Microsoft is scrambling for near-term AI capacity across self-build, leases, and neocloud.
- Microsoft’s monetization thesis is Tokens/API > IaaS; Azure Foundry is framed as a 'token factory.'
- Accelerator dependencies: Nvidia remains the workhorse; MAIA lags; Microsoft may use OpenAI’s ASIC.
- Oct 28 agreement details (as disclosed/linked): Azure API exclusivity for OpenAI continues; Microsoft IP rights extended to 2032; research IP access ends by AGI panel decision or 2030; OpenAI to purchase $250B+ of Azure services; no right-of-first-refusal for Microsoft; both parties can independently pursue AGI.
- The agreement both locks in Azure demand (via OpenAI’s Azure spend) and loosens exclusivity constraints operationally (no ROFR).
- Training vs post-training/inference mix is shifting; post-training compute (RL/SFT/mid-training) is ramping and is latency-insensitive, enabling placement in remote data centers.
- Microsoft’s compute fleet is described as 'fungible.'
- Economic life of GPUs is expected to extend beyond 2–3 years, implying long-lived clusters with continual data growth needs (checkpoints, logs, evals, datasets).
- Enterprise token monetization is early but expected to grow with Foundry, supporting sustained distributed storage growth.
- Networking engagement plan should focus on minimizing egress for VAST’s Azure offerings (e.g., ExpressRoute Direct Local).
