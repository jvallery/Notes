# Microsoft requests Azure VoC for GPU performance testing, VAST declines due to readiness

**Date**: 2025-12-11

**Account**: [[Microsoft]]

**Attendees**: Ray Coetzee, Lior Genzel, Karl Vietmeier, Myself

## Summary

Microsoft is testing a physical VAST PoC system in its Redmond lab but lacks GPU nodes, so they requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance tests against Azure GPU VMs. Lior Genzel directed Ray Coetzee to schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft team and stated VAST will decline because VAST Azure is not ready for this use case.


## Action Items


- [?] Schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft team who requested an Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing, so VAST can communicate the decision to decline. @Ray Coetzee ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Communicate to Microsoft that VAST will not provide an Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing because VAST Azure is not ready, and position the physical PoC as the appropriate evaluation vehicle. @Lior Genzel ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide the expected performance profile for an Azure VoC deployment (if needed for internal alignment or to answer Ray Coetzee's question). @Karl Vietmeier #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- VAST will decline Microsoft's request to provide an Azure VoC instance for performance testing against Azure GPU instances because VAST Azure is not ready for this use case.




## Key Information


- Microsoft has a physical VAST proof-of-concept (PoC) system installed in Microsoft's lab in Redmond and is actively testing it.

- Microsoft's Redmond lab currently does not have GPU nodes available for testing.

- Microsoft requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU instances because their Redmond lab lacks GPU nodes.

- Lior Genzel stated that VAST will respond 'NO' to Microsoft's request for an Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing because VAST Azure is not close to being ready for this use case.

- Lior Genzel plans to personally communicate the decline to Microsoft and asked Ray Coetzee to schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft team who made the request.

- Lior Genzel told Karl Vietmeier that Karl is optional on the follow-up call with Microsoft Azure because Lior plans to block the request.
