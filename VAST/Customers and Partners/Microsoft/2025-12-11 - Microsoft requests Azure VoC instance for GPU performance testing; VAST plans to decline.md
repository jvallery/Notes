# Microsoft requests Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing; VAST plans to decline

**Date**: 2025-12-11

**Account**: [[Microsoft]]

**Attendees**: Ray Coetzee, Lior Genzel, Karl Vietmeier, Myself

## Summary

Microsoft is testing a physical VAST PoC system in Microsoft's Redmond lab but lacks GPU nodes, so they requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU VMs. Lior Genzel directed Ray Coetzee to schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft requestors and stated VAST will say no because VAST on Azure is not ready for this use case.


## Action Items


- [?] Propose and schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft team who requested an Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing so Lior Genzel can communicate the decision to decline. @Ray Coetzee ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- VAST will not provide an Azure VoC instance to Microsoft for GPU performance testing because VAST on Azure is not ready for this use case.




## Key Information


- Microsoft has a physical VAST proof-of-concept (PoC) system installed in Microsoft's lab in Redmond and is actively testing it.

- Microsoft's Redmond lab does not currently have GPU nodes available for testing.

- Microsoft requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU virtual machines because their on-prem lab lacks GPU nodes.

- Lior Genzel stated VAST will decline the request for an Azure VoC instance for Microsoft GPU performance testing because VAST on Azure is not close to being ready for that use case.

- Lior Genzel asked Ray Coetzee to propose a follow-up call with the Microsoft team who requested the Azure VoC instance so Lior can communicate the 'no' decision directly.

- Lior Genzel told Karl Vietmeier that Karl is optional on the follow-up call with Microsoft Azure because Lior plans to block the Azure VoC request.
