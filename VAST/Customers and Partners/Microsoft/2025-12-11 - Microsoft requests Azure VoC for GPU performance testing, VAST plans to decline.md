# Microsoft requests Azure VoC for GPU performance testing, VAST plans to decline

**Date**: 2025-12-11

**Account**: [[Microsoft]]

**Attendees**: Ray Coetzee, Lior Genzel, Karl Vietmeier, Myself

## Summary

Microsoft is testing a physical VAST PoC system in its Redmond lab but lacks GPU nodes, so they requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance tests against Azure GPU instances. Lior Genzel directed Ray Coetzee to schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft requestors and stated VAST should say no because VAST Azure is not ready for this use case.


## Action Items


- [?] Propose and schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft team who requested an Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing, so VAST can respond and set expectations. @Ray Coetzee ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Communicate to Microsoft on the follow-up call that VAST will not provide an Azure VoC instance for Azure GPU performance testing because VAST Azure is not ready for this use case. @Lior Genzel ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide input to Ray Coetzee and Lior Genzel on how VAST should approach Microsoft's request for an Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing (Ray explicitly asked Jason Vallery to chime in). @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Define the expected performance profile for an Azure VoC instance (Ray Coetzee asked Karl Vietmeier what performance profile to expect). @Karl Vietmeier #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- VAST will not provide an Azure VoC instance to Microsoft for Azure GPU performance testing because VAST Azure is not ready for this use case (decision communicated by Lior Genzel on 2025-12-11).




## Key Information


- Microsoft has a physical VAST proof-of-concept (PoC) system installed in Microsoft's lab in Redmond and Microsoft is actively testing it.

- Microsoft's Redmond lab does not currently have GPU nodes available for testing.

- Microsoft requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU instances because their Redmond lab lacks GPU nodes.

- Lior Genzel stated VAST should decline the Microsoft request for an Azure VoC instance because VAST Azure is not close to being ready for this type of testing.

- Ray Coetzee asked Karl Vietmeier to define the expected performance profile of an Azure VoC instance for Microsoft testing.
