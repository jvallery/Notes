# Operations planning for Microsoft MAI 58 x 58 first-hall deployment at Nebius NJ (Opp-17629)

**Date**: 2026-01-05

**Account**: [[Microsoft]]

**Attendees**: Lior Genzel, Rick Scurfield, Moshe Pinto, Ray (last name unknown), Regina (last name unknown)

## Summary

Lior Genzel outlined operations and procurement planning for a Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) training deployment at the Nebius New Jersey data center, scaling to 812 x 812 overall and starting with a first-hall 58 x 58 phase targeted for May/June 2026. VAST is pushing for a procurement decision in the coming business days to enable end-of-January procurement, with open questions on whether Microsoft will source switches and/or NAND supply chain and whether the solution will be VAST vs Azure Blob.


## Action Items


- [?] Check whether Microsoft can source their own 800Gig switches for the MAI Nebius New Jersey deployment, given VAST price book does not include 800Gig switches and supply chain constraints apply. @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-09 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide Ray (last name unknown) configuration flexibility input for the Microsoft MAI Nebius New Jersey first-hall deployment so Lior Genzel can finalize and share an organized configuration package. @TBD 📅 2026-01-05 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Add the potential March 2026 57 x 57 shipment for the Microsoft opportunity to the Soft Backlog list as a placeholder until the configuration and timing firm up. @Regina (last name unknown) 📅 2026-01-10 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Ask Microsoft for a software purchase order (SW PO) that covers the full scope of the MAI Nebius New Jersey project, beyond the first-hall hardware currently reflected in SFDC Opp-17629. @TBD 📅 2026-01-31 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Procurement decision is between deploying VAST vs Microsoft Azure Blob for the Microsoft MAI training deployment at the Nebius New Jersey data center.




## Key Information


- Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) training deployment at the Nebius New Jersey data center is planned to scale to an 812 x 812 configuration at full build-out.

- The MAI Nebius New Jersey deployment is designed to be installed in phases, with the first phase requiring hardware for one hall and a 58 x 58 setup.

- Latest update as of 2026-01-05 is that Microsoft expects to install the first hall of the Nebius New Jersey MAI deployment in the May/June 2026 timeframe, then move aggressively to the other 13 halls before the end of 2026.

- VAST is running a parallel evaluation with Microsoft MAI to determine whether the Nebius New Jersey deployment can be done on Microsoft hardware (Azure Blob or Azure Compute) or using Microsoft NAND supply chain, due to severe supply chain constraints.

- Salesforce opportunity for this Microsoft MAI Nebius New Jersey first-hall hardware phase is SFDC Opp-17629, and the current SFDC opportunity scope calls out only the hardware for the first hall.

- VAST plan is to request a software purchase order (SW PO) from Microsoft that covers the full scope of the MAI Nebius New Jersey project, not just the first-hall hardware.

- VAST SFDC quote for the Microsoft MAI Nebius New Jersey deployment does not include switches because 800Gig switches are not available in VAST's price book.

- Lior Genzel stated he will check whether Microsoft can source their own switches for the MAI Nebius New Jersey deployment, and noted the same supply chain concern applies to NAND.

- Rick Scurfield told Regina (last name unknown) that Lior Genzel mentioned a possible need to ship a 57 x 57 configuration in the March 2026 timeframe for the Microsoft opportunity, and that it was not yet on the Hard/Soft Backlog list.

- Rick Scurfield noted that VAST may try to source hardware from Dell for the Microsoft opportunity, but recent information suggested that may not be possible.
