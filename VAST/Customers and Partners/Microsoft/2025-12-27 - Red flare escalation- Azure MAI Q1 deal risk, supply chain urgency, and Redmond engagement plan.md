# Red flare escalation: Azure MAI Q1 deal risk, supply chain urgency, and Redmond engagement plan

**Date**: 2025-12-27
**Account**: [[Microsoft]]
**Attendees**: Jeff Denworth, Jonsi Stephenson, Lior Genzel, Rick Scurfield, Renen Hallak, Jason Vallery, Aung (Unknown last name), Maneesh Sah

## Summary

Jeff Denworth escalated concern that VAST is losing the chance of a Q1 deal with Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) due to slow execution and supply chain constraints. He laid out a January milestone plan (commercial presence in Redmond, supply chain/build discussions, executive alignment, then paperwork) and warned missing milestones makes the deal effectively impossible. Jonsi Stefansson reported Microsoft contacts (Aung and Maneesh) expect an Azure Blob integration proposal and that Microsoft supply chain intel is blocked until contacts return from OOO on January 5, 2026.

## Action Items

- [?] Sync with Jonsi Stephenson to draft and deliver VAST integration proposal for Azure Blob Storage requested by Microsoft contacts Aung (last name unknown) and Maneesh Sah. @Myself 📅 2025-12-30 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

## Decisions

- Jeff Denworth proposed shifting VAST's operating assumption to treat CoreWeave testing for Microsoft MAI as largely cosmetic and to prioritize immediate commercial and supply chain execution to enable a January 2026 first order.

- Jeff Denworth proposed operating assumption that CoreWeave testing for the Microsoft MAI deal is largely cosmetic and should not be treated as the gating factor for commercial execution.

- Jeff Denworth proposed that either Lior Genzel or Jonsi Stefansson should be physically in Redmond immediately at the start of the new year to begin commercial discussions with Microsoft MAI.

## Key Information

- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) needs 2 exabytes (2EB) of storage capacity deployed ('on the floor') in calendar year 2025.

- Jeff Denworth stated global supply chain conditions are in turmoil and VAST likely cannot support the MAI deal supply chain natively through Arrow or Avnet.

- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft has a large hardware allocation across Azure but is still in a bad supply chain position.

- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft is considering HDDs for the first April 2026 delivery for MAI scale-up, and that HDD supply is also constrained.

- Jeff Denworth stated testing at CoreWeave for the MAI effort has not started in earnest as of 2025-12-27.

- Jeff Denworth stated VAST has not started commercial discussions with Microsoft about the MAI deal as of 2025-12-27.

- Jeff Denworth asserted Microsoft must order hardware early to ensure GPUs are utilized quickly, and therefore must decide on storage software early because software choice materially impacts hardware purchase decisions.

- Jeff Denworth asserted VAST is the most infrastructure-efficient storage option for Microsoft MAI at scale.

- Jeff Denworth said he asked Jonsi Stephenson and Lior Genzel (on Monday 2025-12-22) to get clarity on Microsoft's MAI supply chain status, and as of 2025-12-27 there was no update.

- Jonsi Stephenson stated he met with Microsoft contacts Aung (last name unknown) and Maneesh Sah, and they expect an integration proposal from VAST for Azure Blob Storage integration.

- Jonsi Stephenson stated he and Jason Vallery planned to sync on the Azure Blob integration proposal on 2025-12-29 or 2025-12-30.

- Jonsi Stephenson stated he sent emails to Microsoft contacts to understand their supply chain position and platform needs, but received out-of-office replies indicating they return on 2026-01-05.

- Jonsi Stephenson stated he is pitching the DRR of VAST to Microsoft as a way to help them during the MAI supply chain crisis.

- Jeff Denworth stated that when VAST closed the first CoreWeave deal, Andy and Leo worked out of CoreWeave offices daily, and that approach has netted $1.5B in bookings so far.

- Jeff Denworth requested more active communication and suggested daily updates as of 2026-01-01, noting that Azure is continuing to sell in the meantime.
