# Red flare escalation: Azure MAI Q1 deal risk, supply chain urgency, and Redmond engagement plan

**Date**: 2025-12-27
**Account**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Jeff Denworth, Jonsi Stephenson, Lior Genzel, Rick Scurfield, Renen Hallak, Jason Vallery, Aung (Unknown last name), Maneesh Sah

## Summary

Jeff Denworth escalated that VAST is at high risk of missing a Q1 2026 Azure MAI deal due to slow commercial engagement and global supply chain constraints. He pushed for immediate on-site presence in Redmond, rapid supply chain clarity, and a January execution plan culminating in paperwork in the last week of January. Jonsi Stefansson reported Microsoft contacts (Aung and Maneesh) expect an Azure Blob integration proposal and that Microsoft contacts are largely out of office until January 5, 2026.


## Action Items


- [?] Sync with Jonsi Stephenson to draft and deliver VAST integration proposal for Azure Blob Storage requested by Microsoft contacts Aung (last name unknown) and Maneesh Sah. @Myself 📅 2025-12-30 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Set up an engineering workshop in Redmond in January 2026 focused on VAST integration with Microsoft Azure Blob Storage for the MAI effort. @Jonsi Stephenson 📅 2026-01-10 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Determine Microsoft's MAI supply chain status and hardware allocation constraints, and report back to Jeff Denworth with actionable guidance for deal execution. @Jonsi Stephenson 📅 2026-01-06 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Determine Microsoft's MAI supply chain status and hardware allocation constraints, and report back to Jeff Denworth with actionable guidance for deal execution. @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-06 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Follow up with Microsoft contacts (names not provided) who are out of office until 2026-01-05 to re-engage on MAI supply chain needs and platform requirements, and keep VAST messages at the top of their inbox. @Jonsi Stephenson 📅 2026-01-05 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Ensure a VAST leader (either Lior Genzel or Jonsi Stephenson) is physically in Redmond at the start of the new year to begin commercial discussions with Microsoft for the MAI deal. @TBD 📅 2026-01-06 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Initiate real supply chain and build planning conversations with Microsoft for the MAI first tranche by the second week of January 2026. @TBD 📅 2026-01-16 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule Renen Hallak to be in Redmond by the third week of January 2026 to meet with 'Scott G' (full name unknown) to align philosophically on the first MAI tranche and scaling plan with VAST. @TBD 📅 2026-01-23 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Drive MAI deal paperwork completion with Microsoft during the last week of January 2026 to preserve probability of Q1 close per Jeff Denworth's milestone plan. @TBD 📅 2026-01-31 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Establish a daily internal update cadence for the Microsoft MAI deal execution and communicate status to Jeff Denworth and the broader thread. @TBD 📅 2026-01-02 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Jeff Denworth proposed shifting VAST's operating assumption to treat CoreWeave testing for Microsoft MAI as largely cosmetic and to prioritize immediate commercial and supply chain execution to enable a January 2026 first order.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) needs 2 exabytes (2EB) of storage capacity deployed ('on the floor') in calendar year 2025.

- Jeff Denworth stated global supply chain conditions are in turmoil and VAST likely cannot support the MAI deal supply chain natively through Arrow or Avnet.

- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft has a large hardware allocation across Azure but is still in a bad supply chain position.

- Jeff Denworth stated Microsoft is considering HDDs for the first April 2026 delivery for MAI scale-up, and that HDD supply is also constrained.

- Jeff Denworth stated testing at CoreWeave for the MAI effort has not started in earnest as of 2025-12-27.

- Jeff Denworth stated VAST has not started commercial discussions with Microsoft about the MAI deal as of 2025-12-27.

- Jeff Denworth asserted Microsoft must order hardware early to ensure GPUs are utilized quickly, and therefore must decide on storage software early because software choice materially impacts hardware purchase decisions.

- Jeff Denworth asserted VAST is the most infrastructure-efficient storage option for Microsoft MAI at scale.

- Jeff Denworth said he asked Jonsi Stephenson and Lior Genzel (on Monday 2025-12-22) to get clarity on Microsoft's MAI supply chain status, and as of 2025-12-27 there was no update.

- Jonsi Stephenson stated he met with Microsoft contacts Aung (last name unknown) and Maneesh Sah, and they expect an integration proposal from VAST for Azure Blob Storage integration.

- Jonsi Stephenson stated he and Jason Vallery planned to sync on the Azure Blob integration proposal on 2025-12-29 or 2025-12-30.

- Jonsi Stephenson stated he sent emails to Microsoft contacts to understand their supply chain position and platform needs, but received out-of-office replies indicating they return on 2026-01-05.

- Jonsi Stephenson stated he is pitching the DRR of VAST to Microsoft as a way to help them during the MAI supply chain crisis.

- Jeff Denworth stated that when VAST closed the first CoreWeave deal, Andy and Leo worked out of CoreWeave offices daily, and that approach has netted $1.5B in bookings so far.

- Jeff Denworth requested more active communication and suggested daily updates as of 2026-01-01, noting that Azure is continuing to sell in the meantime.
