# Jason weighing VAST vs Crusoe

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Account**: [[Microsoft]]
**Attendees**: Jai Menon, Jason Vallery

## Summary

Jason discussed two external options: a complex, high-variance offer from VAST and a more stable offer from Crusoe with a deadline by Wednesday. Microsoft could not provide competitive compensation or clear scope/path to partner given Apollo’s undefined boundaries, so staying at Microsoft was deemed not viable. Jason planned to quantify VAST offer risk with CEO Renan and decide by Wednesday, likely resigning if he accepts an external offer.
## Action Items
- [ ] Quantify risks in the VAST offer and negotiate potential tweaks with VAST CEO Renan. @Jason 📅 2025-10-07 🔺 #task
- [ ] Update Jai after meeting with Renan on VAST offer risk and any changes. @Jason 📅 2025-10-07 🔺 #task
- [ ] Decide between VAST and Crusoe and prepare resignation if proceeding externally. @Jason 📅 2025-10-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Notify Jai of final decision and resignation timing. @Jason 📅 2025-10-08 🔺 #task

## Decisions
- Do not pursue a Microsoft counteroffer/retention package.
- Staying at Microsoft is not viable at this time; Jason will choose between VAST and Crusoe by Wednesday and likely resign if accepting an external offer.

## Key Information
- Crusoe offer deadline is Wednesday; VAST provided no explicit deadline.
- Microsoft cannot match external compensation and lacks clarity on scope and path to partner.
- Apollo scope is in flux with many stakeholders and unclear boundaries, increasing delivery and career risk.
- VAST role is PM-type reporting to Jeff and Renan; includes owning PM for a cloud control plane (via Red Stapler acquisition) with dotted-line support to Microsoft co-sell BD and OpenAI Project Stargate efforts.
- VAST compensation includes equity plus a commission-like component tied to OpenAI/Azure sales with wide outcome variance (potentially zero to many millions).
- Jason values hands-on technical work plus customer-facing influence; Jai has seen these strengths at OpenAI.
