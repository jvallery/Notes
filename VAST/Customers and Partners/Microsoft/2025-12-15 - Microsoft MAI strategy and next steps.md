# Microsoft MAI strategy and next steps

**Date**: 2025-12-15
**Account**: [[Microsoft]]
**Attendees**: Lior Genzel, Jason Vallery

## Summary

Lior and Jason aligned on Microsoft MAI stakeholder mapping, positioning for executive meetings (Satya/Scott/Mustafa), and how to navigate internal Azure Storage politics while advancing VAST’s foothold via Apollo/MAI. They discussed a potential “better together” approach via deep Azure Blob integration (including possible Blob API on VAST, tiering/offload), and planned a January Microsoft trip (Florida/Bay Area/Redmond) plus near-term design work and outreach to Microsoft contacts.
## Action Items
- [ ] Offer Kushal a meet-and-greet with Renan and request help sponsoring/arranging a Renan–Mustafa meeting (or confirm if Mustafa will be at Davos). @Lior Genzel ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ] Write the Azure Blob integration design doc (API surface MVP, transparent offload, namespace management, and Blob-as-capacity-tier options) and review it with Jeff by Friday. @Myself 🔺 #task #proposed
- [ ] Send an update email to Vamshi outlining progress (partner onboarding status, Azure prioritized over AWS for marketplace GA, upcoming design doc/design review) and include pipeline signals (EY, NBCU; UKMET testing progress). @Lior Genzel ⏫ #task #proposed
- [ ] Plan a Microsoft travel week targeting the week of 2026-01-12 (Florida, Bay Area, Redmond) to advance MAI mapping and Blob integration discussions; ensure schedule works around Jason’s 2026-01-15 commitment. @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-12 #task #proposed
- [ ] Email Eagle to set up a call on UKMET/LSV5 configuration exercise (compute options for MAI), asking who from his team should join and proposing times. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed

## Decisions
- Focus Blob API integration MVP on MAI/OpenAI training workloads first, with a broader roadmap later.
- Use Kushal’s response to the Renan–Mustafa request as a signal of his true sponsorship/stance.

## Key Information
- Leah provided names for MAI org mapping; team wants reporting chain/flow chart for key contacts (Kushal, Vipin, etc.).
- Apollo POC is moving toward a production VAST environment (per Lior).
- Azure Storage dissatisfaction is a key MAI pain point; internal pressure exists to keep Azure successful (Satya/Scott influence).
- Project Bifrost is described as Manish’s broad effort to address MAI escalations from the Falcon supercomputer experience; timeline likely extends into late spring/summer.
- Potential N-Scale Portugal cluster may rely on adjacent Azure Spain region for storage due to local space constraints (uncertain whether MAI or Copilot).
- UKMET is testing VAST in Azure: a 7-node cluster in Sweden and an additional 12-node cluster in US East 2 (as described).
- Two potential marketplace-related deals may close before end of January: EY and NBCU.

## Topics
- Microsoft MAI stakeholder mapping and influence strategy
- Executive meeting strategy (Satya, Scott, Mustafa) and Davos planning

- “Better together” strategy: VAST + Azure Blob (tiering/offload, Blob API)
