# Microsoft Azure engagement tasks

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Account**: [[Microsoft]]
**Attendees**: Jeff Denworth, Jason Vallery

## Summary

Task list for Microsoft/Azure engagement workstreams, including networking/egress minimization, validating Azure GA milestones vs Lifter phases, and ensuring compliant ROI data usage. Additional deliverables include comparison slides, BizDev education and intros, a power-savings-to-GPU one-pager, and evaluating higher-density storage SKUs or an OEM hardware path for Marketplace offers.
## Action Items
- [ ] Draft a Microsoft networking engagement plan focused on minimizing egress (e.g., ExpressRoute Direct Local) for VAST’s Azure offerings. @Jeff 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Validate Azure GA milestones and align with Lifter program phases (Feb GA vs Sep 1P milestone). @Jeff 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task
- [ ] Validate what Microsoft data can be used in ROI comparisons before sharing with Nidhi. @Jason 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Create a comparison slide for conversations (LSv4, v5, OEM/ODM, Azure Storage). @TBD 📅 2025-11-08 #task
- [ ] Educate Microsoft BizDev (density/power, single-namespace story) and secure intros to Ronnie via John Tinter. @Jason 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Create a one-pager converting VAST EB power savings into additional GPUs per site; share with MAI (Mustafa), Kushal, and Vipin. @Jason 📅 2025-11-08 🔺 #task
- [ ] Assess complementing the Marketplace L-series offer with higher-density storage SKUs or an OEM hardware path. @Jason 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #task

## Key Information
- Focus area includes minimizing Azure egress costs (e.g., ExpressRoute Direct Local) for VAST offerings.
- Need to align Azure GA milestones with Lifter program phases (Feb GA vs Sep 1P milestone).
- ROI comparison materials must use only Microsoft data approved for such comparisons before sharing externally (e.g., with Nidhi).
- Planned collateral includes comparison slides and a one-pager translating power savings into additional GPUs per site.
- Go-to-market consideration: augment Marketplace L-series offer with higher-density storage SKUs or an OEM hardware path.
