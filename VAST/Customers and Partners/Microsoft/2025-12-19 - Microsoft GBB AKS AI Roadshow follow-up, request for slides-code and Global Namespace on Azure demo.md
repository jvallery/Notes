# Microsoft GBB AKS AI Roadshow follow-up, request for slides/code and Global Namespace on Azure demo

**Date**: 2025-12-19

**Account**: [[Microsoft]]

**Attendees**: Tiffany Stonehill, Mohamad Al Jazaery, Kurt Niebuhr, Lior Genzel, Jason Vallery, Chris Carpenter, Kent Altena, Sooyoung Moon, Andrew Thomas, Sheila Mueller, Yuval Mazor, Alan Weaver, Zack Soenen, WW AI SC IaaS

## Summary

After VAST presented VAST + AKS to Microsoft Global Black Belt (GBB) AI infrastructure sellers, Microsoft requested the slides and code used in the presentation and asked about a plan for a Global Namespace on Azure demo/accelerator to include in the AI roadshow. Tiffany Stonehill will coordinate with Jason Vallery to send slides/access, and Lior Genzel recommends a Global Namespace burst-to-Azure demo path and wants a follow-up call to integrate it into the roadshow.


## Action Items


- [?] Send Microsoft (Mohamad Al Jazaery and Kurt Niebuhr) the slides and code that VAST presented in the Microsoft GBB AKS AI Roadshow session, coordinating with Tiffany Stonehill. @Myself 📅 2026-01-06 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Align with Lior Genzel on the latest engineering status and messaging for demonstrating VAST Global Namespace on Azure (on-premises burst into Azure) for inclusion in the Microsoft AI roadshow. @Myself 📅 2026-01-10 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Tiffany Stonehill and Mohamad Al Jazaery to schedule a pipeline sync in January 2026, based on Mohamad's request to connect and his 2026-01-05 suggestion to sync the next day. @Tiffany Stonehill 📅 2026-01-06 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Respond to Mohamad Al Jazaery on whether VAST has a plan for a Global Namespace on Azure demo/accelerator and propose next steps for integrating it into the Microsoft AI roadshow. @Chris Carpenter 📅 2026-01-10 #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- For a Microsoft AI Roadshow demo, Lior Genzel recommended positioning VAST Global Namespace as an on-premises-to-Azure bursting workflow for VAST customers.




## Key Information


- Microsoft Global Black Belt (GBB) AI infrastructure sellers hosted a session where VAST Data presented VAST + AKS as part of the AKS AI Roadshow.

- Mohamad Al Jazaery (Microsoft) requested that Chris Carpenter and Jason Vallery share the slides and code that VAST presented to the Microsoft GBB team.

- Mohamad Al Jazaery (Microsoft) asked whether VAST has a plan for a demo/accelerator showing VAST Global Namespace on Azure, to include in the Microsoft AI roadshow.

- Tiffany Stonehill (VAST Data) stated she will coordinate with Jason Vallery to send the slides and access to Microsoft contacts after the GBB presentation.

- Tiffany Stonehill (VAST Data) deferred questions about showcasing VAST Global Namespace on Azure to Lior Genzel because he has the most recent engineering updates.

- Lior Genzel (VAST Data) recommended that the demo focus on how VAST on-premises customers can use VAST Global Namespace to burst into Azure, and he proposed a follow-up call to integrate this into the Microsoft AI roadshow.

- Mohamad Al Jazaery (Microsoft) was out for the next two weeks starting 2025-12-19 and suggested reconnecting in January; on 2026-01-05 he proposed syncing the next day.
