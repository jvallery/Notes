# Azure MAI red flare: accelerate commercial + supply chain actions in January

**Date**: 2025-12-27

**Account**: [[Microsoft]]

**Attendees**: Jeff Denworth, Jonsi Stefansson, Lior Genzel, Rick Scurfield, Renen Hallak, Jason Vallery, Unknown Microsoft contact Aung, Unknown Microsoft contact Maneesh, Unknown Microsoft contact Scott G, CoreWeave (company)

## Summary

Jeff Denworth escalated risk to a Q1 Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) deal due to slow progress, supply chain uncertainty, and lack of active commercial engagement. The thread calls for immediate on-site presence in Redmond, an Azure Blob integration proposal, and a January execution plan with weekly milestones culminating in late-January paperwork.


## Action Items


- [?] Sync with Jonsi Stefansson to draft and align the VAST integration proposal with Azure Blob requested by Microsoft contacts Aung and Maneesh. @Myself 📅 2025-12-30 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Determine Microsoft MAI supply chain position and constraints (allocation, HDD vs SSD options, timing) to guide VAST deal strategy, as requested by Jeff Denworth. @Jonsi Stefansson 📅 2026-01-05 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Determine Microsoft MAI supply chain position and constraints (allocation, HDD vs SSD options, timing) to guide VAST deal strategy, as requested by Jeff Denworth. @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-05 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Plan for either Lior Genzel or Jonsi Stefansson to be physically in Redmond immediately at the start of the new year (early January 2026) to begin commercial discussions with Microsoft MAI stakeholders. @TBD 📅 2026-01-02 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Set up an engineering workshop in Redmond in January 2026 with Microsoft to review the Azure Blob integration proposal and technical integration approach. @Jonsi Stefansson 📅 2026-01-10 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Start real supply chain and build conversations with Microsoft MAI stakeholders by the second week of January 2026. @TBD 📅 2026-01-16 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Schedule Renen Hallak to be in Redmond by the third week of January 2026 to meet with Microsoft stakeholder 'Scott G' to align philosophically on the first MAI tranche and scaling plan with VAST. @Renen Hallak 📅 2026-01-23 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Drive paperwork completion for the Microsoft MAI deal during the last week of January 2026. @TBD 📅 2026-01-31 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Propose and implement a daily update cadence for the Microsoft MAI pursuit to address Jeff Denworth's concern about insufficient active communication. @TBD 📅 2026-01-02 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Assume the CoreWeave testing for Microsoft MAI is largely a cosmetic validation exercise and proceed aggressively with commercial and supply chain actions in parallel.




## Key Information


- Jeff Denworth stated he is rapidly losing confidence in closing a Q1 deal with Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) due to slow progress and insufficient aggressiveness from VAST.

- Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) needs 2 exabytes (2EB) of storage capacity deployed on the floor within the year referenced in the email thread (context: planning for early 2026 execution).

- Jeff Denworth reported global supply chain turmoil and that VAST likely cannot support the MAI scale natively via Arrow or Avnet supply chain channels.

- Jeff Denworth reported Microsoft is also constrained by supply chain but has a large allocation across Azure.

- Jeff Denworth reported Microsoft is considering HDDs for the first April delivery for MAI scale-up, and that HDD supply is also constrained.

- Jeff Denworth stated testing at CoreWeave for this MAI-related effort has not started in earnest.

- Jeff Denworth stated VAST has not started commercial discussions with Microsoft about the MAI deal at the time of the email.

- Jeff Denworth asserted Microsoft must order hardware early to ensure GPUs are utilized quickly, and therefore must decide on storage software early because software choice impacts hardware purchase decisions.

- Jeff Denworth asserted VAST is the most infrastructure-efficient storage option for Microsoft MAI at scale.

- Jonsi Stefansson met with Microsoft contacts identified as Aung and Maneesh, and they expect an integration proposal from VAST for Azure Blob.

- Jonsi Stefansson stated he and Jason Vallery planned to sync on the Azure Blob integration proposal on December 29 or December 30, 2025.

- Jonsi Stefansson stated VAST plans to set up an engineering workshop in Redmond in January 2026 related to the Azure Blob integration proposal.

- Jonsi Stefansson emailed Microsoft contacts to determine Microsoft supply chain status and future needs for their largest platforms, and received out-of-office replies indicating return on January 5, 2026.

- Jeff Denworth referenced a prior CoreWeave deal where Andy Bernstein and an individual named Leo worked out of CoreWeave offices daily, which Jeff credits with generating $1.5B in bookings so far.

- Jeff Denworth requested more active communication and suggested moving to daily updates on the Microsoft MAI effort.
