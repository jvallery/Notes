# Microsoft MAI Nebius NJ data center phased deployment, first hall 58 x 58, decision needed by end of January 2026

**Date**: 2026-01-05

**Project**: [[SFDC Opp-17629]]

**Attendees**: Lior Genzel, Moshe Pinto, Rick Scurfield, Ray (last name unknown), Regina (last name unknown)

## Summary

Lior Genzel shared details on a Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) training deployment at the Nebius New Jersey data center that scales to 812 x 812, starting with a first-hall 58 x 58 phase targeted for May/June 2026. VAST is pushing for a procurement decision in the coming business days to enable an end-of-January 2026 procurement decision, with an open decision between VAST and Azure Blob.


## Action Items


- [?] Check whether Microsoft can source their own 800Gig switches for the Microsoft MAI Nebius NJ deployment (since VAST price book does not include 800Gig switches). @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-09 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide Regina (last name unknown) the specific expected configuration for the Microsoft opportunity (Rick Scurfield requested Lior Genzel to send the configuration). @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-09 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Update internal backlog tracking (Soft Backlog) for the potential March 2026 shipment of a 57 x 57 configuration for the Microsoft opportunity, pending confirmation over the next few weeks. @TBD 📅 2026-01-12 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Align with Ray (last name unknown, UK) on how flexible VAST's configuration can be for the Microsoft MAI Nebius NJ deployment and incorporate into the organized information package. @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-06 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Drive internal readiness to support a Microsoft procurement decision between VAST Data and Azure Blob in the coming business days, targeting procurement decision before 2026-01-31. @Myself 📅 2026-01-31 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Procurement decision for the Microsoft MAI Nebius NJ first-hall deployment is between VAST Data and Azure Blob (Microsoft's original plan).

- Target to reach a decision in the coming business days to enable a procurement decision before the end of January 2026.




## Key Information


- Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) training project at the Nebius New Jersey data center is planned to scale to an 812 x 812 full-scale deployment.

- The Microsoft MAI Nebius NJ deployment is designed to be installed in phases, with the first phase requiring hardware for one hall and a 58 x 58 setup.

- Latest update shared by Lior Genzel: Microsoft expects to install the first hall of the Nebius NJ MAI project in the May/June 2026 timeframe, then move aggressively to the other 13 halls before the end of 2026.

- VAST triggered urgency with Microsoft MAI due to severe supply chain constraints and started a parallel evaluation of whether the deployment can be done on Microsoft hardware (Azure Blob or Azure Compute) or using Microsoft NAND supply chain.

- Salesforce opportunity for this Microsoft MAI Nebius NJ project is Opp-17629; the current SFDC opportunity calls out only the hardware for the first hall.

- Plan stated by Lior Genzel: ask Microsoft for a software purchase order (SW PO) that covers the full scope of the MAI Nebius NJ project, not just the first hall hardware.

- VAST SFDC quote for the Microsoft MAI Nebius NJ project does not include switches because 800Gig switches are not available in VAST's price book.

- Lior Genzel stated he will check whether Microsoft can source their own 800Gig switches for the MAI Nebius NJ deployment.

- Rick Scurfield told Regina (last name unknown) that Lior Genzel mentioned a possible need to ship a 57 x 57 configuration in March 2026, and that it was not visible on the Hard/Soft Backlog list at the time of the email.

- Rick Scurfield noted that Lior Genzel mentioned trying to source hardware from Dell for the Microsoft opportunity, but Rick was unsure it would be possible based on recent information.
