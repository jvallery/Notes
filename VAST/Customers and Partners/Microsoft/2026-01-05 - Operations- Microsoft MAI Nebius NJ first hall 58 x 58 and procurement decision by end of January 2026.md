# Operations: Microsoft MAI Nebius NJ first hall 58 x 58 and procurement decision by end of January 2026

**Date**: 2026-01-05

**Account**: [[Microsoft]]

**Attendees**: Lior Genzel, Moshe Pinto, Rick Scurfield, Ray (unknown last name, UK-based), Regina (unknown last name)

## Summary

Lior Genzel shared operational context for the Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) training deployment at the Nebius New Jersey data center, targeting 812 x 812 at full scale and a phased rollout starting with a first-hall 58 x 58 configuration. VAST is pushing for a procurement decision in the coming business days to enable a procurement decision before the end of January 2026, with an open decision between VAST and Azure Blob.


## Action Items


- [?] Check whether Microsoft can source their own 800Gig switches for the Microsoft MAI Nebius NJ deployment, since VAST's price book does not currently include 800Gig switches. @Lior Genzel ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide an organized package of configuration and deployment details for the Microsoft MAI Nebius NJ opportunity, after confirming with Ray (UK-based) how flexible VAST's configuration can be. @Lior Genzel 📅 2026-01-05 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Add the potential March 2026 57 x 57 configuration need for the Microsoft opportunity to the soft backlog until the requirement firms up. @TBD #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Update Salesforce opportunity Opp-17629 to reflect the plan to request a software purchase order covering the full scope of the Microsoft MAI Nebius NJ project (not only first-hall hardware). @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Drive internal alignment to support a procurement decision between VAST Data and Azure Blob for the Microsoft MAI Nebius NJ first-hall deployment, targeting a decision in the coming business days to enable procurement before 2026-01-31. @TBD 📅 2026-01-31 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Procurement decision for the Microsoft MAI Nebius NJ first-hall deployment is between VAST Data and Azure Blob (Microsoft's original plan).

- VAST intends to request a software purchase order that covers the full scope of the Microsoft MAI Nebius NJ project, beyond the first-hall hardware currently listed on SFDC Opp-17629.




## Key Information


- Microsoft AI Infrastructure (MAI) training project at the Nebius New Jersey data center is planned to scale to an 812 x 812 configuration at full scale and be installed in phases starting with one hall at 58 x 58.

- Latest update shared by Lior Genzel: Microsoft expects to install the first hall of the Nebius NJ MAI deployment in the May/June 2026 timeframe, then move aggressively to the other 13 halls before the end of 2026.

- VAST triggered urgency with Microsoft MAI due to severe supply chain constraints and is running a parallel evaluation of whether the deployment can be done on Microsoft hardware (Azure Blob or Azure Compute) or using Microsoft NAND supply chain.

- Salesforce opportunity Opp-17629 currently calls out only the hardware for the first hall of the Nebius NJ MAI deployment; the plan is to request a software purchase order that covers the full project scope.

- The current Salesforce quote for the Microsoft MAI Nebius NJ deployment does not include switches because 800Gig switches are not available in VAST's price book.

- Lior Genzel stated he will check whether Microsoft can source their own 800Gig switches for the Nebius NJ MAI deployment.

- Rick Scurfield told Regina (unknown last name) that Lior Genzel mentioned a possible need to ship a 57 x 57 configuration in the March 2026 timeframe for the Microsoft opportunity, and that it should be placed on the soft backlog until it firms up.

- Rick Scurfield noted that Lior Genzel mentioned trying to source hardware from Dell for the Microsoft opportunity, but Rick was unsure it would be possible based on recent information.

- Lior Genzel added 'Ray' to the email thread and indicated Ray is UK-based and will advise on how flexible VAST's configuration can be for the Microsoft MAI deployment.
