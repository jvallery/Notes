# Microsoft requests Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing; VAST declines

**Date**: 2025-12-11

**Account**: [[Microsoft]]

**Attendees**: Ray Coetzee, Lior Genzel, Karl Vietmeier, Myself

## Summary

Ray Coetzee reported that Microsoft is testing a physical VAST PoC system in Microsoft's Redmond lab but lacks GPU nodes, so Microsoft requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU VMs. Lior Genzel directed Ray to schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft requestors and stated VAST's answer will be no because VAST on Azure is not ready for this use case.


## Action Items


- [?] Suggest and schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft team who requested an Azure VoC instance so Lior Genzel can communicate VAST's refusal. @Ray Coetzee ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Provide the expected performance profile for an Azure VoC instance (if needed for internal alignment), in response to Ray Coetzee's question. @Karl Vietmeier #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- VAST will not provide an Azure VoC instance to Microsoft for performance testing against Azure GPU instances because VAST on Azure is not ready for this use case.




## Key Information


- Microsoft has a physical VAST proof-of-concept (PoC) system installed in Microsoft's lab in Redmond and is actively testing it.

- Microsoft's Redmond lab currently does not have GPU nodes available for testing.

- Microsoft requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU instances because their on-prem lab lacks GPU nodes.

- Lior Genzel stated that VAST will not provide an Azure VoC instance for this Microsoft request because VAST on Azure is not close to being ready for this type of testing.

- Lior Genzel asked Ray Coetzee to propose a follow-up call with the Microsoft team who requested the Azure VoC instance so Lior can communicate the refusal directly.

- Lior Genzel told Karl Vietmeier that Karl is optional on the follow-up call with Microsoft Azure because Lior plans to block the Azure VoC request.
