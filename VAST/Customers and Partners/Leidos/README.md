## Key Facts

- Google Distributed Cloud has connected and air-gapped variants; NetApp is the incumbent storage partner.
- Google issued a US-based RFP to replace NetApp for GDC storage; VAST was invited to respond and is undergoing vendor due diligence.
- Google’s emphasis areas include air-gapped support, compliance/attestations (e.g., DISA STIG), ops model (updates, staffing, troubleshooting), multi-tenancy, quotas, encryption, and tags.
- Fort Meade "Gemini as a service" on-prem initiative is described as a Q4 commit and a near-term joint validation path.
- GDC deployments commonly run on Dell; HPE and Cisco are also in scope for hardware options.
- VAST recently launched Google Marketplace offers; broader partnership is still early.
- Resource risk: Greg may be heavily focused on Leidos next year, potentially impacting continuity.
- Jason received 100% rewards and felt it did not reflect a high-impact year; he perceived it as potentially retaliatory.
- Jason has 13 years at Microsoft and strong relationships with OpenAI.
- Jason has 2 external job offers and expects ~4 by end of the week; retention risk is high.

## Opportunities

- Greg expected to focus heavily on Leidos next year (resource planning consideration)
