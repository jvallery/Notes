## Summary

An OrderAdmin alert confirms VAST submitted a $96,808.14 deal (FOpp-4197, "Leidos DoD Cloud") for a software-only cloud deployment in a Leidos GovCloud instance, described as the first Cloud PO in the US Federal sector. Jennifer Azzolina noted the cloud deployment will connect to an on-prem system to build a resilient government demo, with "Golden Dome" as the first pitch and a "submarine mentality" resilience concept. Jeff Denworth instructed Jason Vallery to track these deals to understand customer expectations, user experience, cloud, and business development angles.


## Action Items


- [?] Track the Leidos Federal Cloud PO (FOpp-4197) and capture customer expectations, user experience requirements, cloud product implications, and business development angles for internal learning. @Myself #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Clarify whether the Leidos Federal FOpp-4197 order includes any hardware component or is strictly software-only, and whether any hardware is an upgrade, to unblock Deal Desk processing. @Greg Castellucci ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Ensure all required order documents for FOpp-4197 are attached to the opportunity in SFDC per the OrderAdmin checklist to meet same-day booking SLA (before 3PM local time). @Greg Castellucci ⏫ #task #proposed #auto
