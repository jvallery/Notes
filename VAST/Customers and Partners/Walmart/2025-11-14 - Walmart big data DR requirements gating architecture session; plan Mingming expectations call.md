# Walmart big data DR requirements gating architecture session; plan Mingming expectations call

**Date**: 2025-11-14
**Account**: [[Walmart]]
**Attendees**: Jason Vallery, Mikey, Brad, Paul, Mingming

## Summary

Internal VAST sync to align on Walmart's big data initiative and unblock customer engagement. The team agreed not to schedule an architecture or whiteboarding session until Walmart clarifies disaster recovery requirements, specifically whether they need full VAST namespace access in cloud or only a data copy. Jason Vallery will lead a 30-minute expectations and vision call with Mingming on 2025-11-14 after 2 pm PT, positioning current capabilities and the forward hybrid roadmap, including more native Google Cloud Storage integration.

## Decisions

- Do not schedule a Walmart architecture or whiteboarding session until Walmart provides definitive requirements, especially the disaster recovery requirement (full VAST namespace access in cloud vs data copy).

- Hold off on providing detailed technical answers in Slack until after an expectations and vision call with Walmart's Mingming sets context, current capabilities, and forward roadmap narrative.

- Do not schedule a Walmart architecture or whiteboarding session until Walmart provides definitive requirements, especially around disaster recovery (full VAST namespace access in cloud versus data copy).

- Hold off on providing detailed technical answers in Slack until after a customer expectations and vision call with Mingming sets context and direction.

- Lead with current VAST capabilities plus a forward-looking hybrid cloud roadmap narrative in the initial customer call, then escalate to a deeper technical session with additional SMEs after requirements are confirmed.

## Key Information

- Walmart's big data initiative has an unresolved disaster recovery requirement: Walmart may need either full VAST namespace access in a public cloud for DR or only a copy of the data for DR.

- VAST's current approach of running VAST on public cloud virtual machines is not viable at the anticipated Walmart big data scale, so the team is prioritizing a hybrid roadmap with deeper native integration to Google Cloud Storage.

- Jason Vallery plans to meet with VAST engineering in Tel Aviv the week after 2025-11-14 to define the roadmap shape for native Google Cloud Storage integration, using Walmart as a marquee design partner for hybrid cloud big data projects.

- Walmart has been pinging the VAST team for answers in the last 24 hours and is expected to provide answers to VAST's requirements questions within about an hour of the meeting time.

- Walmart's big data initiative has an unclear disaster recovery requirement, specifically whether Walmart needs full VAST namespace access in a public cloud for DR or only a copy of the data.

- VAST's current approach of running VAST on public cloud VMs is not viable for Walmart's anticipated scale for DR and hybrid big data use cases.

- VAST is driving a hybrid cloud roadmap that includes deeper, more native integration with Google Cloud Storage, which VAST cannot do today.

- Jason Vallery plans to meet with VAST engineering in Tel Aviv the week after 2025-11-14 to specify the roadmap shape for hybrid cloud capabilities, using Walmart as a marquee design partner for hybrid cloud big data projects.

- Walmart is evaluating two VAST proposals for the big data initiative, a minimum configuration versus a larger phase-one configuration, with the primary difference being D-boxes and capacity.

- Walmart's decision timeline for selecting between the minimum configuration and the larger phase-one proposal is approximately 1 to 1.5 months from 2025-11-14.

- The Walmart big data opportunity was discussed as potentially scaling to approximately 500 PB and framed as up to a $300M deal if successful.
