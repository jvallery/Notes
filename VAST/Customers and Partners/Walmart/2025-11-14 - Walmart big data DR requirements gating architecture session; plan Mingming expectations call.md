# Walmart big data DR requirements gating architecture session; plan Mingming expectations call

**Date**: 2025-11-14
**Account**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Jason Vallery, Mikey, Brad, Paul, Mingming

## Summary

Internal VAST sync aligned on how to respond to Walmart's big data initiative, with the key gating item being clarified disaster recovery requirements. The team agreed not to schedule an architecture or whiteboarding session until Walmart confirms whether DR requires full VAST namespace access in cloud or only a data copy, and to run a short expectations and vision call with Mingming on 2025-11-14 after 2pm PT.


## Action Items


- [?] Schedule and send invite for a 30-minute call with Walmart contact Mingming on 2025-11-14 after 2pm PT. @Mikey 📅 2025-11-14 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Share Walmart's answers to VAST requirements questions in Slack before the call with Mingming. @Mikey 📅 2025-11-14 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Lead the 30-minute call with Mingming to set expectations, describe current VAST capabilities, and position the hybrid cloud roadmap narrative for Walmart's big data initiative. @Myself 📅 2025-11-14 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Attend the call with Mingming and support with context and Q&A for Walmart's big data initiative. @Brad 📅 2025-11-14 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Attend the call with Mingming and support with context and Q&A for Walmart's big data initiative. @Paul 📅 2025-11-14 #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate Tel Aviv engineering sessions to define requirements and roadmap shape for more native Google Cloud Storage integration driven by Walmart hybrid big data needs. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto




## Decisions


- Do not schedule a Walmart architecture or whiteboarding session until Walmart provides definitive requirements, especially the disaster recovery requirement (full VAST namespace access in cloud vs data copy).

- Hold off on providing detailed technical answers in Slack until after an expectations and vision call with Walmart's Mingming sets context, current capabilities, and forward roadmap narrative.




## Key Information


- Walmart's big data initiative has an unresolved disaster recovery requirement: Walmart may need either full VAST namespace access in a public cloud for DR or only a copy of the data for DR.

- VAST's current approach of running VAST on public cloud virtual machines is not viable at the anticipated Walmart big data scale, so the team is prioritizing a hybrid roadmap with deeper native integration to Google Cloud Storage.

- Jason Vallery plans to meet with VAST engineering in Tel Aviv the week after 2025-11-14 to define the roadmap shape for native Google Cloud Storage integration, using Walmart as a marquee design partner for hybrid cloud big data projects.

- Walmart has been pinging the VAST team for answers in the last 24 hours and is expected to provide answers to VAST's requirements questions within about an hour of the meeting time.
