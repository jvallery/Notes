# Walmart requirements restated, hybrid namespace and GCS integration required

**Date**: 2025-12-23
**Account**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Jeff Denworth

## Summary

Jeff Denworth relayed that Walmart restated requirements after an internal meeting: they need a long-term hybrid solution and the business will not accept two disjoint namespaces. Walmart plans an on-prem-only big data POC in 2025 and any forward solution must integrate with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), which may increase Alluxio's relevance and requires VAST PM to analyze requirements for product planning.


## Action Items


- [?] Analyze Walmart's restated requirements from the 2025-12 internal requirements meeting and identify which requirements should be incorporated into VAST's product plan. @Myself 📅 2026-01-10 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with 'Mikey' (full name not provided) and their team to review Walmart requirements and propose a path to a single-namespace hybrid solution with Google Cloud Storage (GCS) integration. @TBD 📅 2026-01-10 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Assess competitive risk from Alluxio given Walmart's GCS integration requirement and single-namespace constraint, and document mitigation options for VAST positioning and product gaps. @Myself 📅 2026-01-17 ⏫ #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Walmart held an internal requirements meeting during the week of 2025-12-22 and restated that they need to build a long-term hybrid solution for their data team.

- Walmart was not successful in getting the business to accept two disjoint namespaces, so any acceptable solution must avoid separate namespaces.

- Walmart plans to start an internal big data proof of concept (POC) sometime in 2025, limited to workloads that can run exclusively on premises.

- Walmart requires integration with Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for any solution they move forward with, or they would need significant lobbying at the database layer including a hybrid cloud database.

- Jeff Denworth warned that Walmart's requirements could put Alluxio back in the driver seat as a competing approach, and VAST should be careful.
