# Walmart restated hybrid requirements, disjoint namespace rejected, Alluxio risk

**Date**: 2025-12-23

**Account**: [[Walmart]]

**Attendees**: Jeff Denworth, Myself, Mikey

## Summary

Jeff Denworth relayed that Walmart restated requirements after an internal meeting: they need a long-term hybrid solution and the business rejected operating with two disjoint namespaces. Walmart plans an internal big data POC in 2025 limited to on-prem-only workloads, and any forward solution must integrate with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), creating risk that Alluxio becomes the preferred approach. Jeff asked PM management to analyze the requirements and determine what should enter the VAST product plan, with a focus on a path to full estate takeover.


## Action Items


- [?] Analyze Walmart's restated requirements (hybrid solution, unified namespace, GCS integration) and propose what changes should be incorporated into the VAST cloud and hybrid product plan. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Mikey and relevant team members to validate Walmart's requirements, POC constraints (on-prem-only workloads), and competitive positioning versus Alluxio, then produce a recommended path to 'total estate takeover' for Walmart. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Walmart stated they need to build a long-term hybrid solution for their data team.

- Walmart was not successful in getting the business to accept operating with two disjoint namespaces, indicating a requirement for a unified namespace across environments.

- Walmart plans to start an internal big data proof of concept (POC) in 2025, limited to workloads that can run exclusively on premises.

- Walmart requires integration with Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for any solution they move forward with, or would require significant lobbying at the database layer including a hybrid cloud database.

- Jeff Denworth assessed that Walmart's requirements could put Alluxio back in the driver seat and warned VAST to be careful about competitive risk.

- Jeff Denworth delegated to VAST product management leadership to work with Mikey and team to analyze Walmart's restated requirements and determine what should be included in the VAST product plan.
