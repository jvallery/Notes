# Walmart restates hybrid requirements, rejects disjoint namespaces, GCS integration required

**Date**: 2025-12-23

**Account**: [[Walmart]]

**Attendees**: Jeff Denworth, Myself, Mikey

## Summary

Jeff Denworth relayed that Walmart restated requirements after an internal meeting: they need a long-term hybrid solution and the business rejected operating with two disjoint namespaces. Walmart plans an internal big data POC limited to on-prem-only workloads, and any forward solution must integrate with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), which may put Alluxio back in a leading position. Jeff asked PM management to analyze the requirements and determine what should enter the VAST product plan, with a goal of a clear path to full estate takeover.


## Action Items


- [?] Analyze Walmart's re-stated requirements from their internal requirements meeting and propose what changes or initiatives should be added to the VAST product plan to support a long-term hybrid solution with a unified namespace and GCS integration. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with Mikey and the Walmart account team to validate Walmart's requirements (unified namespace, GCS integration, on-prem-only POC scope) and assess competitive positioning versus Alluxio. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Define a concrete strategy and execution path for 'total estate takeover' at Walmart, including how VAST will address unified namespace and hybrid integration requirements without relying on disjoint namespaces. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Walmart held an internal requirements meeting during the week of 2025-12-22 and restated that they need a long-term hybrid solution for their data team.

- Walmart was not successful in getting the business to accept operating with two disjoint namespaces, indicating a requirement for a unified namespace across environments.

- Walmart plans to start an internal big data proof of concept (POC) sometime in 2025, limited to workloads that can run exclusively on premises.

- Walmart requires integration with Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for any solution they move forward with, or alternatively would require significant lobbying at the database layer including a hybrid cloud database approach.

- Jeff Denworth believes Walmart's requirements may put Alluxio back in the driver seat and warned VAST to be careful competitively.
