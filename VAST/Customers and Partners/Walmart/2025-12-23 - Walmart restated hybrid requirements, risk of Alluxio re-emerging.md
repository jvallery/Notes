# Walmart restated hybrid requirements, risk of Alluxio re-emerging

**Date**: 2025-12-23
**Account**: [[]]
**Attendees**: Jeff Denworth

## Summary

Jeff Denworth relayed outcomes from Walmart's internal requirements meeting: Walmart still needs a long-term hybrid solution and the business rejected operating two disjoint namespaces. Walmart plans an on-prem-only big data POC in 2025 and any forward solution must integrate with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), creating risk that Alluxio becomes the preferred approach unless VAST aligns product plans to the updated requirements.


## Action Items


- [?] Analyze Walmart's restated requirements from their internal requirements meeting and identify which requirements should be incorporated into the VAST product plan to support a long-term hybrid solution with a unified namespace and GCS integration. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Coordinate with 'Mikey' (full name not provided) and team to translate Walmart's updated requirements into actionable product planning inputs and next steps. @TBD ⏫ #task #proposed #auto

- [?] Assess competitive positioning and mitigation plan for Alluxio given Walmart's requirement for GCS integration and unified namespace, and propose a path for VAST to win 'total estate takeover' at Walmart. @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #auto






## Key Information


- Walmart held an internal requirements meeting during the week of 2025-12-22 and restated that they need a long-term hybrid solution for their data team.

- Walmart was not successful in getting the business to accept operating two disjoint namespaces, indicating a requirement for a unified namespace across environments.

- Walmart plans to start an internal big data proof of concept (POC) sometime in 2025, limited to workloads that can run exclusively on premises.

- Walmart requires any solution they move forward with to integrate with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), or they will need significant lobbying at the database layer including potentially adopting a hybrid cloud database.

- Jeff Denworth flagged that Walmart's GCS integration requirement could put Alluxio back in the driver seat, creating competitive risk for VAST.
