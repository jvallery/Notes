## Key Facts

- Google Distributed Cloud has connected and air-gapped variants; NetApp is the incumbent storage partner.
- Google issued a US-based RFP to replace NetApp for GDC storage; VAST was invited to respond and is undergoing vendor due diligence.
- Google’s emphasis areas include air-gapped support, compliance/attestations (e.g., DISA STIG), ops model (updates, staffing, troubleshooting), multi-tenancy, quotas, encryption, and tags.
- Fort Meade "Gemini as a service" on-prem initiative is described as a Q4 commit and a near-term joint validation path.
- GDC deployments commonly run on Dell; HPE and Cisco are also in scope for hardware options.
- VAST recently launched Google Marketplace offers; broader partnership is still early.
- Resource risk: Greg may be heavily focused on Leidos next year, potentially impacting continuity.
- Kurt is global pre-sales lead for AI Infra under Zia; his team scores constrained GPU allocations and must approve any allocation of constrained SKUs.
- Kurt’s proposal: GA Azure Extended Zones as network-only plus AKS NodeJoin (ACAS FlexNode) to connect neo/sovereign cloud training sites to Azure for global inference.
- VAST vs Azure Blob per 1 EB: ~1/10 racks, ~1/5 megawatts, >=5x performance, but ~2x capex.

## Opportunities

- Include HPE SKU recommendations; potential platform for Fort Meade (HPE Alletra/E-box referenced)
- Potential ODM/manufacturing partner for VAST-qualified hardware SKUs
- Referenced as example OEM/hardware partner type for Azure Dedicated-style specs
