## Key Facts

- Google Distributed Cloud has connected and air-gapped variants; NetApp is the incumbent storage partner.
- Google issued a US-based RFP to replace NetApp for GDC storage; VAST was invited to respond and is undergoing vendor due diligence.
- Google’s emphasis areas include air-gapped support, compliance/attestations (e.g., DISA STIG), ops model (updates, staffing, troubleshooting), multi-tenancy, quotas, encryption, and tags.
- Fort Meade "Gemini as a service" on-prem initiative is described as a Q4 commit and a near-term joint validation path.
- GDC deployments commonly run on Dell; HPE and Cisco are also in scope for hardware options.
- VAST recently launched Google Marketplace offers; broader partnership is still early.
- Resource risk: Greg may be heavily focused on Leidos next year, potentially impacting continuity.
- Jason Vallery recently took on cloud product responsibility reporting to Jeff Denworth; vision is a planet-scale multi-tenant/SaaS platform across hyperscalers and neo-clouds.
- Karl Vietmeier is a hands-on Linux/distributed-systems specialist with strong automation skills (bash/PowerShell/Terraform/Ansible; some Python) and uses AI tools heavily for productivity.
- A GDC RFP surfaced via Cisco; success requires integration with Google control plane (APIs, monitoring, billing).

## Opportunities

- Cisco gear-based POC with Google DoD/IC and Fort Meade validation path
- Joint pursuit of VAST-qualified opportunities pending Cisco SP team alignment
- Channel/partner path for GDC RFP procurement (Google potentially procuring VAST via Cisco for GDC deployments)
- Referenced as a comparison point for customer events and as a networking ecosystem where partners may assume clients can connect to southbound switches.
- Referenced as example OEM/hardware partner type for Azure Dedicated-style specs
- Referenced as prior employer context for structured processes
