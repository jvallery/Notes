## Key Facts

- Cisco manages many sites globally with data replication and requires regex pattern capabilities for file management.

- Cisco manages many sites globally where data is replicated, involving hundreds of relationships.

- Cisco needs regex pattern capabilities to allow or deny files/objects by name.

- Cisco is participating as a partner/sponsor at VAST Forward.

- Operates many global sites with data replication across hundreds of replication relationships.

- Requests regex patterns in replication policies to allow or deny files/objects by name (examples: allow only *.LIB, deny *.mp3).

- Wants replication exclusions for enterprise multi-geo liability protection, for example preventing replication of copyrighted content via 'never replicate' patterns.
## Opportunities

- Cisco gear-based POC with Google DoD/IC and Fort Meade validation path
- Joint pursuit of VAST-qualified opportunities pending Cisco SP team alignment
- Channel/partner path for GDC RFP procurement (Google potentially procuring VAST via Cisco for GDC deployments)
- Referenced as a comparison point for customer events and as a networking ecosystem where partners may assume clients can connect to southbound switches.
- Referenced as example OEM/hardware partner type for Azure Dedicated-style specs
- Referenced as prior employer context for structured processes
