## Key Facts

- Jason Vallery recently took on cloud product responsibility reporting to Jeff Denworth; vision is a planet-scale multi-tenant/SaaS platform across hyperscalers and neo-clouds.
- Karl Vietmeier is a hands-on Linux/distributed-systems specialist with strong automation skills (bash/PowerShell/Terraform/Ansible; some Python) and uses AI tools heavily for productivity.
- A GDC RFP surfaced via Cisco; success requires integration with Google control plane (APIs, monitoring, billing).
- Edge/extended-zone footprints are large (~60–80 racks) and can fail if parent-region connectivity is lost.
- Without object/S3 offload (capacity/perf decoupling), VAST lacks a viable cloud cost/perf model.
