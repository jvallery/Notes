|Azure Service|Primary scenarios and integration value|Network connectivity|Status|Blockers / gaps|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Azure AI Foundry|- RAG grounding + retrieval over large private corpora; “knowledge base” for agents<br>    <br>- App-tier calls VAST: InsightEngine/DataBase (vector + metadata) over S3/HTTP; DataStore for source docs<br>    <br>- Zero-copy RAG (query data where it lives); lower duplication vs copying into separate vector stores|Azure AI Foundry itself doesn’t mount storage; your orchestration app runs on AKS/App Service/VMs in Customer VNet and reaches VAST via VNet peering/Private Link Service (PLS)|🟡|Not a direct storage integration requires reference architecture + app pattern; optional need for VAST-managed auth alignment (VAST)|
|Azure AI Foundry (Hub/Project control plane)|- Secure AI Foundry hub/project networking (private access) while datasets live on VAST<br>    <br>- Compute-plane mounts: DataStore (NFS) or S3; AI OS features (DataEngine pipelines) for agentic workflows<br>    <br>- High-performance dataset access for training/agent pipelines without rewriting storage layer|AI Foundry supports private endpoints for hubs/projects; compute used by projects must reach VAST via Customer VNet injection/peering or PLS|🟡|Control-plane defaults to Azure Storage account selection for “first party” experiences; VAST can be used via compute-plane mounts but not always as a first-class “project default datastore” (Microsoft control-plane + VAST docs/UX)  <br>  <br>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/configure-private-link?view=foundry-classic|

AML “Datastores” are Azure-storage-centric for managed UX|🟢|AML managed “Datastore” UX assumes Azure Storage accounts; for best perf, bypass datastore and mount directly (Solution architecture + customer ops)<br><br>  <br><br>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-data?view=azureml-api-2|
|Azure AI Search|- Index + retrieval over documents living on VAST; hybrid indexing where “gold source” stays on VAST<br>    <br>- S3 (preferred) for custom ingestion pipelines; Blob API façade (roadmap/MVP) if trying to use Blob indexer semantics<br>    <br>- Keep source data on VAST; reduce copies; accelerate refresh cycles|AI Search outbound to private resources often uses shared private link patterns; VAST reachable via PLS + approval workflow OR ingest via pipeline that runs in Customer VNet|🟡|Blob Indexers assume Azure Blob semantics; to integrate “natively” needs either (a) VAST Blob API compatibility or (b) custom indexer pipeline (VAST + customer). Private connectivity model must be validated per tenant (Customer + VAST)<br><br>  <br><br>https://docs.azure.cn/en-us/search/search-indexer-howto-access-private|
|Microsoft Fabric / OneLake (Shortcuts)|- Virtualize VAST datasets into Fabric lakehouses/notebooks without ETL<br>    <br>- S3-compatible shortcut to VAST S3 endpoint; optionally DataEngine pipelines feeding curated parquet/delta<br>    <br>- “Virtual lakehouse” over VAST: query-in-place; avoid copy-to-OneLake tax; leverage Fabric compute on top of VAST data|Managed VNet: OneLake shortcuts to external S3-compatible endpoints typically require public reachability OR On-Prem Data Gateway for private network paths|🟡|S3-compatible shortcut uses key/secret-style credentials; private connectivity usually requires gateway; Fabric managed private endpoints do NOT support FQDN endpoints/PLS (Microsoft platform constraint + VAST guidance)<br><br>  <br><br>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/create-s3-compatible-shortcut|
|Microsoft Fabric (On-Premises / private shortcut bridging)|- Access VAST in private VNets or on-prem via gateway<br>    <br>- S3-compatible shortcut via On-Prem Data Gateway to VAST S3 VIP  <br>      <br>    <br>- Unlock private datasets (no public endpoint); faster adoption in regulated environments|Gateway machine must have network path to VAST endpoint; Fabric uses gateway as bridge|🟡|Gateway is a bottleneck & operational burden; HA/scale patterns required (Customer + Microsoft docs; VAST sizing guidance)<br><br>  <br><br>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/create-on-premises-shortcut|
|Azure Databricks Classic (VNet injected)|- ETL + ML engineering; spark workloads over high-performance data plane<br>    <br>- VAST DataBase (spark connector) and/or DataStore via NFS/S3<br>    <br>- High throughput + predicate pushdown; reduce shuffle; one shared dataset for spark + non-spark code|VNet-injected classic compute reaches VAST over peering/ExpressRoute; no managed VNet wall here|🟢|Requires deploying/validating VAST spark connector and tuning; otherwise, straightforward (VAST)|
|Azure Databricks Serverless (SQL/Model Serving)|- Serverless SQL/serving accessing VAST datasets securely<br>    <br>- S3 endpoint (and/or future Blob API)<br>    <br>- Stay relevant as Databricks shifts to serverless; keep storage layer consistent across classic + serverless|Serverless compute plane uses Network Connectivity Configurations (NCC) + Private Link to reach customer resources via Azure load balancer / private connectivity|🟡|Validate whether serverless Private Link can target partner PLS endpoints in your environment; expect extra networking approval/ops (Customer + Databricks + VAST)<br><br>  <br><br>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/network/serverless-network-security/serverless-private-link|

|Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)|- Inference farms; feature/model serving; RWX shared storage for thousands of pods<br>    <br>- CSI driver (NFS) and/or direct NFS mounts; AI OS for pipelines (DataEngine)<br>    <br>- “True RWX performance” + consistent semantics; avoid Azure Files throttling for metadata-heavy workloads|Customer VNet: nodes connect to VAST via peering/ExpressRoute/PLS; private DNS required for clean endpointing|🟢|Validate CSI auth story: Azure Workload Identity / federated tokens vs static secrets; define best practice (VAST + customer platform team)  <br>  <br>https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/|
|Azure Batch|- Burst rendering, genomics, Monte Carlo; thousands of cores need shared dataset<br>    <br>- NFS/SMB mounts to VAST DataStore; DataSpace for hybrid datasets<br>    <br>- Prevent I/O starvation at job start; faster checkpoints & job completion|Customer VNet pools mount VAST on boot; peering/ExpressRoute/PLS|🟢|Mount automation & image hardening are customer tasks; otherwise, straightforward (Customer)|
|Azure Data Factory (ADF)|- Orchestrate copy/transform pipelines to/from VAST and Azure storage<br>    <br>- S3 connector to VAST<br>    <br>- ADF remains orchestration hub while VAST is performance tier; reduce custom scripts|Managed VNet + managed private endpoints for Azure PaaS; for private access to VAST, typically use Self‑Hosted Integration Runtime (SHIR) in customer network|🟡|Managed VNet has limited ability to reach arbitrary endpoints; SHIR introduces VM ops tax; “first-class” VAST would require deeper integration (Customer + Microsoft + VAST)  <br>  <br>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/managed-virtual-network-private-endpoint|
|Azure Storage Mover|- Migrate SMB/NFS file shares into Azure storage (Blob/Files)<br>    <br>- Typically uses VAST as SOURCE (NFS/SMB) when migrating into Azure first-party storage<br>    <br>- High-speed lift-out of legacy NAS data where VAST is source of truth|Agent-based; runs where data is; targets are Azure storage services|🟡|Storage Mover targets are Azure first-party storage; it won’t target VAST as a destination (Microsoft product constraint). Use VAST SyncEngine/AzCopy/Rclone for VAST-target migrations (Customer + VAST). Storage Mover built on AzCopy so Microsoft could enable the scenario once VAST has BlobAPI.  <br>  <br>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage-mover/endpoint-manage|

|Azure Functions|- Serverless transforms on arrival; glue code for sync + indexing<br>    <br>- DataEngine triggers Functions via HTTPS; Functions then call VAST S3/Blob API/NFS paths indirectly<br>    <br>- Fast “reaction loops” (tokenize, embed, catalog) without managing servers|Functions can integrate with VNets; private endpoints supported for inbound; outbound to VAST via VNet integration + routing|🟡|Native Blob-trigger bindings are tied to Azure Storage accounts; use webhook/event patterns instead. VNet integration constraints vary by plan (Customer + Microsoft + VAST)  <br>  <br>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-vnet|
|Azure Logic Apps / Power Automate|- Workflow automation around data arrival + approvals<br>    <br>- DataEngine → Event Grid/HTTP to Logic Apps; Logic Apps invokes downstream systems<br>    <br>- Business-process automation integrated with data pipelines|Typically managed; can use private endpoints for some resources; otherwise through connectors|🟡|Connector behaviors and private network support vary widely; define supported “blessed” patterns (Customer + Microsoft)|

|Azure Lighthouse|- Fleet management for many VAST deployments across tenants<br>    <br>- Control-plane integration for managed app offers; operational delegation (not data path)<br>    <br>- MSP-scale operations; centralized governance + delegated access|Azure control plane delegation; no data plane requirement|🟡|Requires packaging decisions (Managed App/Marketplace) and Lighthouse definitions (VAST product + GTM)|
|Azure Private Link / Private Link Service (PLS)|- Secure private access to VAST endpoints from customer VNets + some managed VNets<br>    <br>- Expose VAST NFS/S3/Blob API behind Azure Standard Load Balancer + PLS<br>    <br>- Security parity with Azure-native storage; no public endpoints|Customer creates Private Endpoints; managed services may require “managed private endpoints” + approval; DNS must be correct|🟡|PLS connection approval workflow must be operationalized; some managed services don’t support FQDN/PLS (Fabric limitation) (Customer + VAST + Microsoft platform limits)  <br>  <br>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/|
