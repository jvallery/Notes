# Persona: Jason Vallery

## About Me

I'm Jason Vallery, working at VAST Data on cloud partnerships and go-to-market strategy.

## My Role & Priorities

- **Cloud Partnerships**: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, AWS integrations
- **Enterprise Relationships**: Key customer accounts (Fortune 500, hyperscalers)
- **Technical Strategy**: Translating product capabilities to customer value
- **Cross-functional Coordination**: Bridging engineering, sales, and product

## What I Care About Extracting

### High Priority
- **Commitments**: Anything I or others committed to doing (with deadlines)
- **Decisions**: Technical or business decisions made
- **Blockers & Risks**: Issues that could delay progress
- **Next Steps**: Clear action items with owners

### Medium Priority  
- **Relationship Context**: Who knows whom, org dynamics, preferences
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Mentions of competitors or alternatives
- **Technical Details**: Architecture decisions, integration requirements
- **Timeline Signals**: Launch dates, milestones, deadlines

### Lower Priority
- **Background Information**: Company history, general context
- **Small Talk**: Personal updates, pleasantries (summarize briefly)

## Task Assignment Rules

When extracting tasks:
- If **I commit** to something ("I'll send...", "Let me follow up...") → owner is **"Myself"**
- If **someone else commits** ("John will send...") → use their **full name**
- If ownership is **unclear** → owner is **"TBD"**
- Infer due dates from context:
  - "tomorrow" → meeting date + 1 day
  - "next week" → meeting date + 7 days
  - "by Friday" → upcoming Friday
  - "end of month" → last day of current month

## Communication Style

- **Tone**: Professional but personable, direct
- **Length**: Concise - prefer bullet points over paragraphs
- **Technical Level**: Comfortable with technical details, but translate for business audiences
- **Follow-up**: Responsive within 24 hours for important items

## Key Relationships

### VAST Leadership
- **Jeff Denworth**: CRO - cloud strategy, partnerships
- **Jonsi Stephenson**: Engineering leadership - OVA, product
- **Lior Genzel**: Technical architecture - cloud integration

### External Partners
- **Microsoft**: Azure Marketplace, MAI integration
- **Google**: GDC partnership, RFP responses
- **OpenAI**: Enterprise deployment discussions

## Context for Drafting

When generating draft replies:
- Open with brief acknowledgment, not lengthy thanks
- Get to the point quickly
- Include clear next steps or asks
- Sign off professionally but briefly
- Reference prior context when relevant

## Scheduling Preferences

- Prefer mornings for deep work
- 1:1s can be 30 minutes unless complex topic
- External meetings: include 5 min buffer
- Avoid Friday afternoon meetings when possible
