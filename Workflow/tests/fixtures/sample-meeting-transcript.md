## Transcript

**Jeff**: Hey Jason, let's catch up on the Google deal.

**Jason**: Sure. They've moved to final contract review. Should close by end of week.

**Jeff**: Great. What about the pricing discussions?

**Jason**: We agreed on the enterprise tier at $50k/month. They pushed back on professional services, so I need to follow up with their procurement team by Friday.

**Jeff**: Okay. One more thing - can you send me the updated deck for the Walmart presentation? I need it by Monday.

**Jason**: Will do.

**Jeff**: Also, we decided to delay the OVA 2.0 release to Q2 to align with the GDC launch.

**Jason**: Makes sense. I'll update the roadmap doc.
