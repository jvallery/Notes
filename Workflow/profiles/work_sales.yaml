name: "Sales/Customer Context"
description: "For customer and partner meetings with revenue-focused outcomes"

# What to prioritize during extraction
focus:
  - Deal status and stage changes
  - Blockers and objections raised
  - Competitive mentions (products, vendors)
  - Next steps and explicit commitments
  - Budget and timeline signals
  - Decision makers and influencers identified
  - Pain points and requirements expressed
  - Pricing discussions and proposals
  - Contract and legal topics

# What to de-emphasize or skip
ignore:
  - Small talk and pleasantries
  - Deep technical implementation details (summarize at high level)
  - Internal process discussions not relevant to deal
  - Off-topic tangents

# Rules for task extraction
task_rules:
  # Only extract tasks with this confidence or higher
  confidence_threshold: 0.75
  
  # How to infer task owner from speaker context
  owner_inference: |
    If the speaker (user) commits to an action, owner is "Myself".
    If a named participant commits, use their first name.
    If ownership is ambiguous, use "TBD".
  
  # How to calculate due dates from relative references
  due_date_inference: |
    Anchor all relative dates to the meeting date.
    "tomorrow" = meeting_date + 1 day
    "next week" = meeting_date + 7 days
    "end of week" = next Friday from meeting_date
    "next month" = first of next month
    If no date mentioned, leave due_date empty.

# Rules for entity matching
entity_matching:
  # Auto-create new entity folder if confidence >= this threshold
  auto_create_threshold: 0.90
  
  # Flag for human review if confidence between these thresholds
  needs_review_threshold: 0.80
  
  # Prefer these entity types for ambiguous matches
  preferred_types:
    - account
    - partner
    - person

# Note type hints based on context
type_hints:
  # If these patterns appear, suggest these note types
  patterns:
    - pattern: "1-1|one-on-one|1:1"
      suggests: "people"
    - pattern: "RFP|proposal|deal|pipeline"
      suggests: "customer"
    - pattern: "partner|alliance|integration"
      suggests: "partners"

  # Include quotes for key statements
  include_quotes: true
  quote_threshold: 0.85  # Only include high-confidence quotes
  
  # Max items per section
  max_tasks: 10
  max_decisions: 5
