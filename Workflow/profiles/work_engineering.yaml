# Profile: Engineering/Technical Context
# For technical discussions, architecture reviews, project work

name: "Engineering/Technical Context"
description: "For technical discussions, code reviews, architecture, and project work"

# What to prioritize during extraction
focus:
  - Technical decisions and rationale
  - Architecture choices and trade-offs
  - API design and interface contracts
  - Performance considerations and benchmarks
  - Security and compliance requirements
  - Integration points and dependencies
  - Bug reports and issue resolution
  - Code review feedback and action items
  - Documentation needs
  - Testing strategy and coverage

# What to de-emphasize or skip
ignore:
  - Off-topic personal discussions
  - Scheduling logistics
  - Administrative topics not related to technical work
  - Repeated explanations of known concepts

# Rules for task extraction
task_rules:
  confidence_threshold: 0.70  # Lower threshold for technical tasks
  
  owner_inference: |
    If the speaker commits to implementation, owner is "Myself".
    If a specific engineer is assigned, use their name.
    For team tasks, use "Team" as owner.
    If ownership unclear, use "TBD".
  
  due_date_inference: |
    Anchor to meeting date.
    "by EOD" = meeting_date
    "tomorrow" = meeting_date + 1 day
    "next sprint" = meeting_date + 14 days
    "next release" = next Friday from meeting_date
    If no date, leave empty.

    - project
    - person
