# Tasks Backlog (Legacy)

Legacy backlog preserved for reference. Current workflow:

- Tasks live in their source notes as checkbox tasks tagged `#task`
- `TASKS.md` is the query-only dashboard (Obsidian Tasks plugin)

Legacy task lists from `Personal/_Tasks/*` and `VAST/_Tasks/*` were archived to `Inbox/_archive/2026-01-04/tasks-legacy/`.
