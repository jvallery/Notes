# Tasks Inbox (capture)

Use this as a quick-dump list. Add lines like:

```
- [?] Do the thing @Owner #task #proposed #inbox ⏫ 📅 2026-01-10
```

- `#task` makes it show up in dashboards.
- `#proposed` means “not yet accepted.” Remove it to accept. Delete it to reject.
- `#inbox` keeps these together; move/rewire tasks into the right note when you have time.
- Sort order in dashboards: priority → due → created.
- Status cycle: Proposed (`?`) → Accepted (`[ ]`) → Done (`x`); Rejected (`X`) hides/cancels.
