# Tasks Inbox (capture)

Use this as a quick-dump list. Add lines like:

```
- [ ] Do the thing @Owner 📅 2026-01-10 ⏫ #task #proposed #inbox
```

- `#task` makes it show up in dashboards.
- `#proposed` means “not yet accepted.” Remove it to accept. Delete it to reject.
- `#inbox` keeps these together; move/rewire tasks into the right note when you have time.
- Sort order in dashboards: priority → due → created.

## Inbox

- [ ] Example: triage the latest emails @Myself ⏫ #task #proposed #inbox
