# 1:1 — Jai Menon — 2025-09-30

> [!info] Purpose
> Build trust, surface and remove blockers, align on priorities, coach & grow.

## Summary

Jason shared he has multiple external management opportunities and plans to decide by end of week. He seeks clear ownership/scope, latitude to execute, leadership role (not IC), stability, and competitive compensation. He is open to staying if Microsoft can address scope/ownership on Apollo and rewards. Jai will brief Manish, await Jason’s best offer and retention asks, and continue the conversation.

## Key facts learned

- Jason has been at Microsoft for 13 years and recently returned from a sabbatical.
- He felt under-recognized in rewards and without an advocate after Juergen left.
- He previously led a 20+ person team; shifted to IC and does not want to remain IC.
- He has 4 external opportunities; 2 are strong, all management-oriented (not IC).
- He aims to choose by end of the week and may present a best external offer for a counter.
- Top priorities: clear ownership/scope, ability to execute, leadership buy-in, stability, industry-level compensation.
- Interest in Apollo but needs clarity on PM ownership, collaborators, resourcing, and exec support.
- Concern that storage infra timelines vs new DC buildouts may outpace a new stack by 2–3 years.
- Jai believes Apollo needs a clean-sheet approach; politics and pace are known challenges.
- Not interested in moving to another hyperscaler; prefers smaller, faster-moving company if leaving.

## Outcomes

- Jai will circle back with Manish to share Jason’s expectations and context.
- Alignment that Jason will present his best external offer and retention asks if he considers staying.
- Confirmed Jason’s preference for a management role over IC.
- Agreed to a short waiting period while offers finalize; open line for ongoing discussion.

## Decisions

- Proceed with a wait-and-see approach until Jason’s end-of-week decision.
- Jai to brief Manish on additional details and potential Apollo leadership considerations.

## Action items (for Jai Menon)

- [x] Compile and send best external offer and specific retention asks (scope, ownership, collaborators, resourcing, compensation) to Manish and Jai. @Jason Vallery 🔺 ✅ 2025-10-26
- [x] Circle back with Manish to share Jason’s concerns and expectations; align on potential retention path and Apollo leadership options. @Jai Menon ⏫ ✅ 2025-10-26
- [x] Update Jason after Manish/Ong rewards discussion with any concrete options. @Jai Menon 🔼 ✅ 2025-10-26

## Follow-ups

- [x] Define Apollo PM ownership, collaborators, resourcing, and executive sponsorship if a retention path is pursued. @Manish ⏫ ✅ 2025-10-26
- [x] Clarify whether a management role (not IC) can be offered to Jason within Apollo or related scope. @Manish ⏫ ✅ 2025-10-26
- [x] Confirm stance and timeline on clean-sheet versus incremental approach for Apollo storage. @Jai Menon 🔼 ✅ 2025-10-26
- [x] Reconnect once offers finalize to review Jason’s decision and any Microsoft counterproposal. @Jai Menon 🔼 ✅ 2025-10-26

## Risks

- Jason may leave Microsoft if scope/ownership and compensation concerns are not addressed.
- Lack of clear advocacy and leadership buy-in could hinder retention.
- Internal politics and territorial boundaries could block execution.
- Apollo may fail without a clean-sheet approach.
- Timeline risk: new storage stack may be 2–3 years out while DCs are being built now.
- Analysis paralysis could delay critical decisions (build vs buy, partner vs build).
- Instability in the industry and layoffs increase retention risk.

## Open questions

- What specific scope and ownership would Jason have on Apollo?
- Who are the defined collaborators and how will territorial conflicts be mitigated?
- What compensation adjustments or stock grants can Microsoft offer to retain Jason?
- Will Jason be offered a management role rather than an IC role?
- What storage solution is ready to deploy now for near-term data center needs?
- How will build vs buy and partner vs build decisions be made and funded for Apollo?
- What is the firm timeline and commitment for a clean-sheet storage approach in Apollo?

> Next meeting (if any): (none)

[00:00:25.26] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason Vallery(computer chiming) Jason. Hey Jay, how you doing? I'm doing all right, how are you doing? Worried about the future of society. I don't know if you saw the Sora product release video that just came out about an hour ago. From a geek's perspective and a technologist's perspective, amazing they've accomplished as a parent and just a member of society. Terrified. Just terrified. I don't know what the future holds. Yeah, well, there's a lot going on in our country right now. It's scary. I mean, Saturday, there was somebody shooting. Sunday, there was another shooting. I tell you, it is a weird time to be alive, um, terrafone, but that, like those videos, you cannot tell they were AI generated. I mean, you just can't, and to create and to come out of the gate with effectively, I don't know if you saw the demos, but they're effectively creating a Tik Tok clone, entirely AI generated and launching it as like a social network. just, man, you're going to, I just don't even know at this point. Oh my God. Yeah, it's crazy. Wow. Uh, well, you know, I, um, when I met with Ong two weeks ago, uh, Right after I met with him, I reached out to Manisha. I mentioned it to you at the time that I wanted to get a one-on-one schedule. That just happened to be yesterday morning on the calendar, and so certainly was not intending to front run and have this conversation with him before I had it with you. I expected I'd talk to you both yesterday. So complete apologies that I ended up talking to him before you. I mean, I'll tell you, uh, obviously I have a tremendous respect for you, so this is nothing to do with you at all. You've been great to me. Every interaction I've ever had with you, I've really enjoyed nothing to do with you. But you know, after I met with Ong, I was surprised, you know, frankly. going into my sabbatical and then, you know, spending that time over the sabbatical, I was actually coming back fairly energetic. I was excited about the role and the opportunity in front of us. Um, but I was also confronted during the sabbatical with layoffs and leading into the sabbatical, I had to lay off a guy on my team. I don't know if I told you this story, but I had a guy on my team. that I had just hired to help out, and he was based here, and him and his wife both worked for Microsoft. They both got laid off on the same day, and, you know, I look at the writing on the wall and I think the entire industry is unstable. It's just like the trend line here. You know me, I'm a bit of an AI optimist. The trend line here is to zero. of us are gonna be out of a job at some point, and when I think about that in the context of the rewards I got, I get felt like, and I'll just be honest, I didn't have a advocate in our storage leadership team. You know, I felt a little bit about, I basically felt that way, honestly, since you're getting retired, right? I mean, not to dread it. up old politics. But when Juergen left, I felt like I had nobody who was Jason's ally and advocate in the storage organization, period, and so I tried to survive over the last year and I did the best I could, and I really, you know, just not one to like aggrandize my own accomplishments, but I really felt like I put it all out there last year. my conversation with Ong, I felt like, frankly, that was a signal from our leadership that I should look for a new job, and so I casually reached out to a few folks, obviously, I know a lot of folks in the industry and it's turned into some conversations I've had over the last couple of weeks that have yielded real offers, things that are interesting. You know, there's two things that are important to me. I really need clear ownership and scope, but I need to know what my priorities really are and that I have the latitude necessary to execute. It means I actually own something and compensation is a factor too, and instability, I guess, is the most important of those things that I know I'm going to have runway. I haven't made a decision. I mean, just being really transparent, I really don't know how this all unfolds. I have my Microsoft Crystal sitting on the shelf just out of frame. can't see him but I've been here 13 years and I'll tell you if you would have asked me a year ago I would have been convinced I would have retired from Azure storage like I would have stayed here until at least I was 55 and leveraged that exit or you know whatever that looked like that was sort of the vision I saw for myself and I really have been very loyal and I would still really appreciate that opportunity in front of me if there's a way to resolve the other challenges. Where I really do feel like I have leadership buy-in in my career, I have an advocate, and I have industry level compensation. But I don't know where that's gonna go. Manish gave me some high levels around Apollo. and how I can fit into that. I think that's interesting. I think it's exciting. I mean, you and I have had initial conversations around what this looks like. I have a lot of really strong opinions about what we need to go build. I'll tell you, going through this exercise over the last couple of weeks and getting to talk to other folks in the industry, I won't name specific company names, but you can imagine, like, who would be interested in me. I've learned a lot about what their strategies look like and what they're thinking and, you know, more convinced than ever on the direction we need to take. You know, there's four real external opportunities, two of them I've probably already ruled out in my head, two that I think are potentials, and what I promised to Manish is I would come back as soon as all the ink has  dried and the paperwork. in front of me and I have the various options and present, you know, a potential path forward for staying or a decision to leave, and I really am open-minded to both of those potential outcomes. Yeah, okay. So, yeah. Yeah, I think you mentioned something about you'll make a decision. by the end of the week is what I was told by him, and on the two issues you mentioned, you know, I think he, I think he mentioned, yeah, anyway, I think he probably broke out the conversation into two parts. One was the whole how you felt about the rewards, and then, you know, the potential stock and other things like you were getting a stock wall of some sort soon or something. You know, one of the lessons that Juergen taught me, and this was exactly four years ago. in my career, you know, the Amazon was hiring like crazy, and the, it was a very different employment landscape. But I, you know, I was complaining to Juergen. I'm like, look, man, like Amazon's paying way more than we're paying. What are we doing here? And Juergen off the record said, "Go get a competitive offer and I'll match it." And so four years ago, I went and had a, Actually, this is how I met Pete Emig. I don't know if you know the backstory behind this. Four years ago, I went over to Amazon and said, "Hey, I'm interested in the job." And they gave me a very, very nice package to come be a product manager on S3, and I handed it to Juergen and Juergen got me a big stock grant out. All of that will vest, I'll have finished that four-year cycle in a few months, and all of that will have vested. Through the process of talking to Amazon, I met Pete and we became friends, and that story played out where it ended up going the other way, and I hired him. - Got it, got it. Okay, so of the issues you mentioned, I mean, I need clarity around scope and ownership of what I'm really going to be responsible for, and then I'm going to have the right ability to influence those things. You know, I'm not territorial. Like I don't want to rule the world, but I want to know that I can own the thing I own, and I do worry a little bit about. what that means in terms of the stakeholders I'll have to collaborate with and, you know, their territorial nature, if I'm honest, and so that's kind of a big concern for me, and then, you know, just where I sit in terms of, you know, direct control, like being an IC is not how I envisioned my career. I hope. I do feel like I'm really good at growing people and being a mentor of others, and, you know, and I have what frankly was a, again, I don't want to re litigate the past, but I went from a team of like 20 something people, and then, you know, because of territorial issues and disconnects on personalities and a whole bunch of things, we don't need to relitigate. taken away, and I don't see the ability to continue to grow if I'm just gonna be put in the corner to write research papers. - So are these other opportunities you're getting are they management opportunities then? - Yes sir. So did you have that conversation with me we ran out of time we didn't get to the details Okay, thanks for sharing that I can I don't circle back with him just so he is aware So all your four offers that are likely to be management offers versus IC offers? - Yeah. - Okay, okay, that's good to know. Or helpful to know, great. I'll pass, make sure I pass that on. Okay, so that part you didn't have a discussion, okay. I'll say there's really two that I think are vital and would be aligned with my goals.

[00:12:11.22] Parallels Desktop : Okay.

[00:12:12.22] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryYeah. Um. That sounds.

[00:12:15.22] Parallels Desktop : That sounds good. I mean.

[00:12:17.22] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryLet me just say something about your. already had two offers in hand and we were waiting for two more or something like this. I've had a verbal commitment for two others and then one that sort of I'm not sure about. You know, I think there's a whole layer of who I see as being potentially winners and losers in this whole race that's going on, and it's also layered over top of that, you

[00:12:43.93] Parallels Desktop : Might think.

[00:12:45.23] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryYeah, of course, of course. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'm, you know, I just want to be in a listening mode here. You know, you've already had conversations with Manish, so I can add more perspective. But, you know, I mean, do you feel like... are you waiting for him to do something between now and Friday, or are you waiting until you tell him on Friday what the scope of your offers are and see how he reacts? I'm not quite sure where you guys left it, so that's not clear to me. I mean, he said that, verbatim, he said he would go deep. my rewards with Aang, but I don't know what that really means because I assume if I'm leaving Microsoft that doesn't really have any outcomes. So it's more a question of, I think, am I asking for something from Microsoft and you and Manish by proxy because I want to stay here, and I, you know, ultimately to go back and play the Jürgen score. of thought on this, showing up with a competitive offer is one way to motivate Microsoft to do things. So, you know, that's kind of the calculus in my head at the moment, is, you know, get the opportunity in writing that I think is, you know, the most lucrative, like, of the set, the one that's got the most, you know, compensation behind it, and, you know, forward that over to you and Manish with a set of like, you know, I'd stay, but here's what I would want in order to make that happen. - Got it, okay, I think, yeah, I mean, sounds like a plan that would make sense. I mean, you know, if I were in your shoes and something happened. You know I can't I can't say that's not something that I might do or not do. But okay. So I think and you're expecting that whatever that one is I mean you have some maybe you'll get something better and then you'll be able to present. best offer and say hey guys here's what I got right and we'll go from there yeah okay but I guess my question is you know you still have concerns about your ability to execute how other people in the organization may try to not let you do things and so on so I guess my broader question would be how how is that dynamic in your mind you know because compensation is just one factor this this this approach is sort of trying to attack the compensation. part of things but it just still feels like you have some other concerns in the back of your head that you know Mahesh and I will have to figure out. I mean the concern is yeah certainly one of the bullet points on that email will be I would want clarity around scope ownership and who the collaborators are for the project. So let's just, I'll throw this out. I don't know that this is what this looks like, but I'll throw it out. Let's just assume that the ownership piece was tied closely to Apollo and you and I, I'm not trying to push you away anyway, go own Apollo together. I'd want to know what does that mean from a PM perspective, who's owning that, who's getting to push all of the different dimensions of what we need to go build? Do we have the right resourcing and funding model to actually go and build something? Is there broad executive support for the project? You know, that piece to me is very unclear in terms of how I would fit into that puzzle, what I would own, and then frankly, like who the broader stakeholders are we'd have to collaborate. I have a great relationship with you men. deep relationship with human. We've crossed paths a number of times, but not in any meaningful depth way. But, you know, obviously there are other folks in the PM team I wouldn't. I wonder why I'm not participating to see. Um, um, yeah. Okay. Um, yeah. I think, yeah, I mentioned I did chat yesterday, well, let me circle back, I think there's a little bit more information that you've provided than maybe came out when I talked to you, so I wasn't quite sure how much. Yeah, I'm certainly sharing at a deeper level with you. Yeah, okay. That makes sense. Um, yeah. Okay. Yeah, I didn't know how much just, you know, I mean, you were gone for three months. You had lots of time to think about things. It just wasn't clear to me, given where you left things. whether that was, you know, something that was bothering you all, all your three hunts of being away, right? I mean, obviously, I'm a, you know, I like to play game theory just like all of us. We all try to think of our chess game at least a couple of moves in advance, and I won't say that the idea didn't cross my mind, but I did actually come fully back. convicted to make this role a success. This wasn't something I put in action until after my meeting with him. - Okay, all right. - And seeing my rewards, like honestly, like I had during that period, I was coming, I was in my mind coming back to being celebrated for the impact I did last year. Right. Right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Not sure. I mean did the did the did the media or conversations not you know were not very clear to you what where you were headed or anything. I mean, even my end of year conversations, I mean, as much animosity as I have with Banshee, we see, we're very similar, like the biggest challenge between Banshee and I is we're far too similar, and the write-up you did for me, even at the end of your connect was all glowing, you had nothing but positive things to say about the impact of Banshee. Okay. Okay. Got it. Okay. Sounds good. You know let me circle. I'll share a little bit more insight with Manish so he has a little bit more data to play with or work with depending on you know how he wants to play that. Um, and then I think we're in a little bit of a waiting thing because I think it's just, you know, we'll have to wait and see what are you going to do at the end of each week, you know, and we'll have to, we'll have to play a little bit by year between, so there may be a few days of, yeah, of waiting. You know, there was a, you know, I was sitting there. - We established clarity after his 14th period, I guess. - I mean, to even give you the further level of transparency, I, you know, the offer that I expect, that is the likely benchmark or reference point for what I will share. I had a conversation with that organization. CEO on Thursday, and it went very well, and so out of that gave me the confidence to even talk to Manish about this yesterday, otherwise I would have probably held my cards a little closer until it was actually in my hands, but I was like, I'm not, I don't often get a chance to talk to Manish, so I felt I should, you know, be a little bit more transparent. No, thanks. Makes sense. That sounds like you've, yeah, had, you know, you have a reasonable expectation for something strong coming through, so I can see why you'd want to do what you did. Okay, great. you know, so I think that's what I'll do. I'll just make sure that giving you a little bit more detail, I'll make sure that I circle back with him as we think about, you know, what's to be done, and yeah, there's a little bit of a waiting game to see how things are playing out. All right, very good. I think, yeah, I just want to make sure I listen carefully and got what you were trying to say. I think I, I think I, I think I understand. Yeah, it's, you know, we've not had a long working relationship, so, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's I can't pass to the past and you know you work with whoever you work with and yeah there's zero influence I had on your work because frankly you know that's between you and Washi and Ong right so of course, and, yeah, I do think that I think there are good opportunities around the pole. The company seems to be pretty serious about making it happen, and they're trying to do it in a way that, you know, cuts the cords with some more traditional ways. ways in which we have invested in things in the past, and so I think there's likely to be faster movement, more out-of-the-box thinking needed, you know, and so I'm more optimistic that things will move. much faster than traditional Microsoft in the Apollo space, and yeah, there are opportunities to have leadership role there. - My biggest worry, honestly, like just to remove all the layers of the other topic and just focus on Apollo, my biggest worry is relate. You know, my biggest worry is that the infrastructure investments are happening now. These data centers are getting built now and we have to go deploy storage in them now, and even if we had all the resources in the world and all the scope and charter had been decided and we were in execution mode, we're still two to three years out from really being able to deliver a new stack at scale. So, what do you actually get? I really worry about that. It's a fair concern. It's a fair concern. Yeah.

[00:24:12.49] Parallels Desktop : Yeah.

[00:24:14.49] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryWhat do we have that's ready to go right now, right, into some of these kind of data centers? Thank you. Yeah, that's why out-of-the-box thinking is needed. Yeah, it'll be interesting to see how that evolves and if we're able to get out of our analysis paralysis that has been Azure Storage over the last decade, you know, and really make some convictive decisions and go. execute them and see if they're willing to do some risky things too. You know, the build versus buy conversation, the partner versus build conversation, I think is still really top of mind. Yeah. Yeah. This is true. Yeah. Um, yeah. How are you feeling? You know, I don't get a lot of your take about all this. You're kind of, you play your cards pretty close. How are you feeling about everything? I mean, with respect to Apollo? I mean, life, the universe and everything, but sure, Apollo, Microsoft, your role on on the storage team, whatever. No, no, I, you know, I think, yeah, I think, I feel pretty good about my role on the STORRS team. I feel like if I really want something to happen, I do feel like, you know, Manish will listen, right? But I, yeah, I do want things to go fast, or I just think, I do think things more slowly. Um, and, yeah, I do get, um, yeah, I'm just, I don't know. I've been seeking, I'm getting exposed a little bit more to some of the politics of Microsoft as well, which can sometimes hinder our ability to move fast because there's always this, well, do we really own that? Or is that really the data team that should be doing that? Or is that really the core AI team that should be owning that? Or, oh, if I open my vest too much to... to another team in Microsoft and they'll take ownership of it, I mean those things I'm just getting more and more exposed. I mean every company has politics, all large companies have politics, but But yeah, I think other than those two things, right But otherwise, you know, I think I'm pretty confident in my ability to make things happen. That I think are the right things to happen. I think people will give me a fair thought and a fair listen to say this is the right way to do things, and I don't even know if that's the right way to do things. I don't mean just within, I don't mean just my niche, but actually more broadly, I've established a lot of connections to other parts of Microsoft as well that are, I mean, I'm a reasonable guy, I say reasonable things. I don't say unreasonable things and I usually back it up with the data. So, you know. People have to listen. They can't just ignore the shit I say and pretend I don't say shit. So I have a lot of... I feel strongly in my ability to influence the production, but I don't have enough ability to influence the rate and pace of things. things, and yeah, I'm not looking for huge teams, you know, give me 500 people and go let me try this thing. I'm not, not, I'm not there. You know, what do I think that's useful? I think big teams are... are unproductive for these kinds of projects, and I think the way things are headed, and we had this conversation in your principals meeting around agent decoding. I think you get five super smart guys and they'll get far more done than 50 mediocre, spread spectrum on the level bands group would do, right? I think you can have a lot more impact with fewer folks in this new era of building software.

[00:29:00.24] Parallels Desktop : Exactly.

[00:29:01.16] Jabra Speak 710 :  Jason ValleryWhat is your gut check on Apollo? Does it turn into Project Clean Sheet or is it lipstick on a pig and we just try to put blob storage in there with Bifrost, whatever solution? I think that if we don't do clean sheet, it will fail. I don't think just doing Bifrost is going to be competitive. So we have to make clean sheet happen. That's my take on it. But that's been a bit of a journey for sure, so, but in some ways the poll may be the thing that says our cards are exposed, we can't keep running the way we've been running. If we don't do clean sheet, we're not, you know, we're not going to be there. the storage solution in Apollo, they'll go figure out some other storage solution for Apollo. That's the way I see it. So, in some ways, I think Apollo is good for clean sheet. So, it's either it will be part of Apollo or storage is not part of, or Azure storage is not part of. part of something else is that's that's what I think yeah that's my yeah I don't know either I'll see how the week goes I mean, in other big companies, there's always politics. Every big company moves slowly, and you might be moving to one of the smaller companies where people can move much faster. So I can't say that it's gonna be where you're going, but for the big companies, it's a lot worse than that. - I'll read that level of detail. set of offers, the big company option is already off from my perspective. So I wouldn't want to go work for another hyperscaler. I just don't see why I would go and trade one devil for another. I'm not interested in that. It would definitely be, you know, smaller company move fast. it. Okay. Awesome. Well, you know, I appreciate your sharing. You know, I think our conversations are always pretty, pretty open. I think you share stuff, I share stuff. So, um, and, uh, yeah, and I have no, I'm not bothered, but I've been you ended up going to Maneesh before coming to me, so don't let that, you know, I mean, I think other managers might have been, but for me it's, it's fine, and in some ways you've had a longer relationship with Maneesh than you have with me, so he's been your manager for quite a long time, and so I. but I have not, you know. Okay. Well, great. Like I said, I'll also invite Manish to share a little bit more on things and some of your expectations, make sure he's aligned, and so he has all the facts. We'll see, and then we'll wait for your -- and a little bit of a waiting game to come up with. - Exactly, yeah, okay, I appreciate you, Jay. - Okay, and yeah, feel free to reach out, you know, between now and the end of the week if you wanna talk about something else that popped up or something, so anyway. - Yep, awesome, if you need me. Thanks, Jay. - Okay, thanks, yeah, bye. (computer chiming)
