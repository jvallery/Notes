# 1:1 — Jeff Denworth — 2025-11-07

> [!info] Purpose
> Build trust, surface and remove blockers, align on priorities, coach & grow.

## Summary
Here’s a tight, no‑nonsense readout that pulls the signal from both your notes and the transcript, flags what’s implied but not said, and converts it into a concrete plan you can run with immediately.

---

## TL;DR (2 lines)

- **Mandate:** You own the **multi‑cloud strategy** end‑to‑end and must translate live deal flow into requirements, docs (Confluence), and focused cloud plays (Azure/AWS/GCP/Oracle + Foundry/Bedrock/Vertex).
    
- **Near‑term proof:** Build the **“dagger” Azure slide**, stand up a **win/loss cadence**, and **embed with SEs**during/after Tech Summit; keep **Morty** focused on Neo while onboarding him to your team.

## Summary

### Organizational Chart Review Meeting

Jason and Jeff discussed the organizational chart, focusing on key personnel and their roles. They reviewed various team members, including Aaron, John, ITSIC, Noah, Sagi, Morty, and others, discussing their responsibilities and areas of expertise. Jeff emphasized the importance of understanding the current state before making changes and expressed interest in Jason's perspective on product management structure. They agreed to have further discussions on this topic in the future.

### Carl's Role Transition at VAST

Jeff and Jason discussed organizational dynamics at VAST, particularly focusing on Carl's role and decision to move him to ProServe under Rob's leadership due to Carl's limitations in customer-facing roles. They agreed that Rob's organization, while technically Customer Success, operates more as a support function with a reactive rather than proactive approach. They noted that while Rob is head of systems engineering, his team primarily consists of systems engineers, and his leadership style may not fully align with the company's culture.

### Sales and Engineering Team Structure

Jeff and Jason discussed the structure and key personnel within the company's sales and engineering teams. Jeff provided an overview of various leaders and their roles, including Sunil, Rich, Gaddy, Randy, and Fawad, highlighting their responsibilities across different regions and teams. Jason expressed interest in connecting with several individuals, including Ryan, to discuss technical topics and potential collaboration.

### Organizational Strategy and Cloud Growth

Jeff and Jason discussed the organizational structure and key personnel at their company. They reviewed the roles of various executives, including Rick's right-hand man Eric, Kristen who leads enablement, and Amy who oversees finance and strategy. Jeff emphasized the importance of organizational strategy versus product strategy, and suggested that Jason schedule regular meetings with Renan to gain different perspectives. They also discussed the need to focus on developing a first-class platform for all clouds to drive growth in their limited market.

### China Business Strategy Debate

Jeff and Jason discussed their differing views on business operations in China, with Jeff advocating for aggressive expansion while Jason advised caution, citing Microsoft's past challenges in the region. They agreed that China should be approached as a sales outpost rather than a location for significant capital investment or operational infrastructure. Jason shared insights from his experience with ByteDance, noting that the company had bypassed Azure Storage by connecting their own data center to Azure via a high-capacity WAN, highlighting the technical and operational challenges of doing business in China.

### Azure Storage and Transition Planning

Jason and Jeff discussed Microsoft's Azure Storage limitations and Jason's ongoing efforts to address them. They also talked about Lior's need for strategic planning help and Jason's computer setup challenges as he transitions from Microsoft to Google tools. Jeff shared his experience using Apple Calendar alongside Google Calendar for meeting management.

### Aligning Impact with Team Goals

Jason and Jeff discussed the benefits of unified apps for managing tasks and data, and Jeff shared a tool for calculating storage costs and performance. They also talked about Jason's interest in exploring various platforms like Grafana and Salesforce. Jason expressed his desire to focus on areas where he can have the most impact, emphasizing the importance of understanding what moves the needle for the team. Jeff suggested that Jason needs to understand the company's philosophy and values to better align his efforts with the team's goals.

### Hands-On Experience in Product Management

Jeff and Jason discussed the importance of hands-on experience in technology and product management. They emphasized that understanding the practical aspects of technology is crucial for making informed decisions and setting effective strategies. Jason highlighted the issue of product managers at Microsoft lacking direct experience with AI pipelines, which can lead to misaligned strategies. Jeff shared his experience working with physical systems and stressed the value of practical knowledge in product development. They agreed that a good product manager should have both technical expertise and the ability to learn from customer experiences.

### Product Management Scope and Roles

Jason and Jeff discussed the need for clear scope and ownership in their product management roles. Jeff emphasized the importance of understanding the product pipeline and feature requirements, which Jason acknowledged but noted he was still learning the ropes. They agreed that Jason should focus on gathering customer intelligence and leading strategic customer meetings, while Lior would handle the broader deal flow management.

### Cloud Strategy and Product Management

Jeff and Jason discussed cloud strategy, product management, and organizational structure. They agreed to focus on developing a cloud-in-a-box solution and improving product management processes. Jason will meet with John to discuss control plane partnerships and then involve Morty in the strategy. They also talked about the need for regular win-loss analysis and a more structured product management approach. Jeff emphasized the importance of professionalizing product management and mentioned plans to discuss organizational changes in the future.
## Executive sentiment & subtext

- **Tone toward you:** Positive, direct, and trusting. Jeff is signalling **“hands‑on first”** and expects you to **lead without waiting for more org changes**.
    
- **What he’ll judge you on in the next 2–4 weeks:**
    
    1. Clear, **crisp Azure gaps narrative** (repeatable across clouds),
        
    2. Evidence you’re **wired into the pipeline** (which plays to chase vs. drop),
        
    3. Visible **SE pull** (they know what you want them to know, and vice‑versa),
        
    4. **First drafts of per‑cloud strategies** that show where VAST **complements vs. competes**.
        
- **Constraints:** PM “professionalization” is desired but **later**—he wants early wins first. Don’t over‑abstract; ship artifacts that sales/eng/SEs can use this month.
    

---

## Key intelligence (new/clarified from transcript)

- **Alliances/Channels:** John owns alliances for **conventional channels** (not clouds). Lior wants to own **BizDev** for cloud but operates **tactically**; you’ll need to set the system view.
    
- **Tech leads:** Sagi = pipelines + serverless; **critical** for cloud packaging. Dima = deep fixer/escalations + L3 networking definition. Daphna & Leeraz = release/program.
    
- **Neo & Morty:** Morty owns **Neo cloud feature requirements**; moving to you but **must keep Neo focus**.
    
- **SE reality:** This layer will **make your success**. Hari singled out as top SE. **No single blueprint**—you must talk to a lot of them.
    
- **Field leadership:** Sunil (APAC), Rich (EAST, product/support pain), Gadi (intl ex‑US/APAC), Randy (Federal). **Ryan** runs the database/data‑engine **overlay**; **FWOD** manages **pipeline/database SEs** (likely under Rob).
    
- **Org cleanups:** “Kartik doesn’t run SE anymore” (implies prior confusion now resolved). **Eric** is Rick’s execution/deal‑desk right hand. **Kristen** runs enablement.
    
- **Customer Success:** It’s **support**, not proactive CS.
    
- **China posture:** **Software‑only sales** are acceptable; **no CAPEX/headcount** build‑out.
    
- **Evidence request:** Jeff wants a **crisp slide** quantifying **Azure Storage gaps**; your **ByteDance/Azure throughput anecdote** is a powerful (internal‑only) proof point if anonymized.
    
- **Tools:** You’ve got **Uplink/Grafana** and **Salesforce**; Jeff also sent a **TCO calc** (HDD↔SSD tipping‑point)—use it to tune your cloud economics story.
    

---

## Decisions & firm outcomes

- **Carl → ProServe (Rob).**
    
- **FRDs/requirements live in Confluence.**
    
- **You** will architect and drive **multi‑cloud strategy** and **catalog in‑flight opportunities** from a **product‑requirements** lens.
    
- **Monthly 1:1 with Brandon** to align on platform direction.
    

---

## Gaps / “What was left unsaid” that matter

- **Scope line with Lior:** Jeff wants you on strategy + product requirements from live deals; Lior runs BD motions. **Codify the split** before friction emerges.
    
- **Confluence taxonomy owner:** Jeff said **A.L.** (likely Alon) + Tomer should steer structure—make them explicit approvers.
    
- **Azure “dagger” data hygiene:** Validate power/throughput/cost assumptions (your debate on rack kW and $/TB shows **inputs vary**). Decide canonical sources now.
    
- **Google RFP:** Needs **fast disqualifiers** for block/latency‑heavy asks (NetApp advantaged). Build a checklist **before** Thursday’s discussions.
    
- **SE prioritization:** Which **specific** SEs/overlays to go deep with post‑Summit is still open—seed a list and let Jeff/Rob react.
    

---

## 7‑Day tactical plan (Nov 10–14, 2025)

**Mon (Nov 10)**

- **Spin up Confluence space & templates** (see taxonomy below) and **migrate Walmart write‑up**.
    
- **Run SFDC pulls**: all active cloud‑related opps (Azure/AWS/GCP/Oracle), stage ≥ Qualified, attach **3 fields** in a working table: _product reqs inferred_, _deal go/no‑go posture_, _FRD link_.
    
- **Draft the Azure “dagger” outline** (structure below) + list of **numbers to validate** with Eng/Field.
    

**Tue–Thu (Nov 11–13) – Orlando**

- **SE embedding:** host a **30‑min “SE Listening Post”** each day; ask for top 3 product gaps per cloud + top 3 “repeatable plays.” Book **Hari**, **FWOD**, **Ryan**, and **Rich** slots.
    
- **Alliances sync:** **1:1 with John**—align on “**cloud‑in‑a‑box**” and Tier‑2 control‑plane partners (G Corp, Ori, Arna, Rafe); pre‑agree on a **joint blueprint outline**.
    
- **Sagi deep dive:** pipelines/serverless **packaging gaps** for cloud; capture **n‑tier SKU’ing** and **runtime/on‑ramp**friction.
    
- **Morty intro:** align on **Neo priorities** and **how you’ll use his cycles** without jeopardizing Neo.
    
- **Brandon handshake:** schedule the **monthly cadence**; bring the **one‑pager** on your multi‑cloud plan shape.
    

**Fri (Nov 14)**

- **Publish v0.1**:
    
    - **Azure “dagger” slide** (v0 data where uncertain, clearly marked).
        
    - **SE signal summary** (top 10 gaps/plays).
        
    - **Per‑cloud plan skeletons** (one page each).
        

---

## 30/60 plan (what “done” looks like)

**By Day 30**

- **Per‑cloud strategy v1** (Azure/AWS/GCP/Oracle): Complement vs. compete, target workloads, required integrations (Foundry/Bedrock/Vertex), packaging, pricing posture, lighthouse targets, SE playbooks.
    
- **Win/Loss + Product MBR cadence live** (see below), with **Q4 dashboard** and first **exec readout**.
    
- **Cloud‑in‑a‑box (Tier‑2) blueprint v0.1** with John/Morty + partner roles/gaps.
    

**By Day 60**

- **Azure/AWS field kits** (deck + “why we win” FAQ + TCO model + FRD links).
    
- **Top‑10 repeatable plays** validated with SEs; **3 lighthouse references** in flight.
    
- **Confluence hygiene:** 100% of active FRDs tagged and linked from SFDC.
    

---

## Stakeholder map: first‑wave engagements (goal‑driven)

- **Brandon (monthly):** Agree on **definition of first‑class multi‑cloud platform** + success metrics; bring a 1‑page dashboard each month.
    
- **John (alliances):** Co‑own **cloud‑in‑a‑box** (Tier‑2) + control‑plane partner responsibilities; set a **joint 6‑week plan**.
    
- **Sagi:** Close **cloud packaging/serverless gaps** → define minimal lovable packaging to transact in cloud marketplaces.
    
- **Morty:** Formalize **Neo focus + contribution lane** (e.g., shared control‑plane requirements, Azure/AWS feature parity delta).
    
- **Ryan & FWOD:** Map **overlay motions** and **pipeline/database SE** engagement; agree on **2 pilot plays** to pressure‑test the kits.
    
- **SEs (Hari et al.):** Start **monthly SE Office Hours**; invite anonymous gap submissions; publish responses in Confluence.
    
- **Rich/Gadi/Sunil/Randy:** 15‑min “**3 plays I want you to try**” briefings per region; gather immediate feedback.

## “Dagger” slide (Azure Storage gaps vs. VAST) — recommended structure

**Title:** “Where Azure Storage breaks for GenAI & Data Engines—and where VAST plugs in”

1. **Workload framing:** model training/finetune, feature stores, vector DBs, checkpointing, streaming pipelines.
    
2. **Three quantified gaps** (example categories—you’ll fill with the right numbers/sources):
    
    - **Sustained throughput @ scale** (e.g., TB/s per region / per account limits; effect of request fan‑out & hot partitioning).
        
    - **I/O path latency for block‑like patterns** (checkpoint/metadata storms; small‑object tax).
        
    - **Operational friction** (namespace limits, lifecycle/immutability tradeoffs, noisy neighbor & throttling patterns).
        
3. **Customer‑proven anecdotes** (anonymized): “Hyperscale media co. connected own storage via Equinix → hit target throughput Azure couldn’t.”
    
4. **VAST fit:** architecture callouts (shared everything, NVMe/Tiering, serverless pipelines), **measured deltas** vs. above gaps.
    
5. **No‑regrets ask to MSFT:** co‑sell scenarios + joint lighthouse criteria + minimal integration work (authN, billing, observability hooks).
    
6. **Replicable across clouds** slide‑footer: the **measurement rubric** you’ll reuse (so the story scales to AWS/GCP/Oracle).
    

> **Immediate next steps for this slide:** lock **canonical numbers** with Eng/Field; cite **where/when measured**; attach **repro steps** (engineers will respect it).

---

## Google RFP triage (fast filters you can use Thursday)

- **If predominant requirement = block/low‑latency I/O with strict p99 SLOs → high NetApp advantage** → clarify scope or **no‑bid**.
    
- Ask explicitly: **p99/p999 latency targets, object vs. block share, IO size distribution, per‑region bandwidth ceilings, checkpoint cadence**, required **multi‑region semantics**, and **on‑ramp time**.
    
- **Decision tree** artifact: _Green_ (object‑heavy + high throughput) / _Yellow_ (mixed) / _Red_ (block‑critical). Publish in Confluence and link in SFDC opp.
    

---

## Win/Loss + Product MBR (lightweight, durable)

**Cadence:** Monthly; **Owners:** You (PM) + Sales Ops; **Attendees:** Jeff, Brandon (when possible), Sales leaders, Eng/SE reps.  
**Inputs:** SFDC closed‑won/lost ≥$X or strategic logo; **SE gap submissions**; key **FRD updates**.  
**Deck sections (fixed):**

1. Pipeline snapshot & **thematic trends**
    
2. **Wins**: 3 patterns to **repeat** (product and GTM attributes)
    
3. **Losses**: 3 patterns to **avoid/fix** (root cause, owner, ETA)
    
4. **Top 5 product gaps** → linked FRDs + decision/ETA
    
5. **Plays to run next month** (per cloud)
    

---

## Confluence taxonomy (make this the “authoritative place”)

```
/Product
  /Cloud
    /Azure | /AWS | /GCP | /Oracle
      /Strategy  (one-pagers + FAQs)
      /Plays     (field kits, SE talk tracks, TCO)
      /FRDs
        /Customer-<Name>-<UseCase>-<YYYYMMDD>
  /Alliances
    /Control-Plane (G Corp, Ori, Arna, Rafe)
      /Cloud-in-a-Box (Blueprint, BOMs, runbooks)
  /MBR
    /Win-Loss-20XX-Q4  (dashboards, decisions, actions)
  /Telemetry & Econ
    /Throughput-Latency-Studies
    /TCO-Models (assumptions, calculators, validation notes)
```

**Rules of the road:** each FRD has **owner**, **decision log**, **metrics table**, **links to SFDC** and **SE notes**.

---

## Risks & watchlist (and how to blunt them)

- **CS is reactive → gap in proactive references.** Use **overlay/SE pilots** to generate 3 references quickly.
    
- **Morty bandwidth sucked into non‑Neo work.** Write a **time‑box** and **explicit deliverables** for his contributions to your cloud plan.
    
- **Lior/Jason boundary fuzz.** Publish a **one‑pager RACI** (Deals/Alliances motions vs. Product requirements/strategy).
    
- **Roadmap trust pockets.** Attach **measurement & repro** to every claim (your Azure slide sets the tone).
    
- **China ambiguity.** Ask Legal/Finance to **document guardrails** (software‑only, no local infra, export/compliance checks).
    

---

## Outreach snippets you can paste today

- **To John (alliances):**  
    “I’m driving our multi‑cloud plan. Let’s co‑own a **‘cloud‑in‑a‑box’** blueprint for Tier‑2 clouds (control planes: G Corp/Ori/Arna/Rafe). Can we carve **45 min in Orlando** to define scope, owners, and a 6‑week plan?”
    
- **To Sagi (pipelines/serverless):**  
    “I’m mapping packaging/on‑ramps for cloud. I’d like your view on **serverless gaps** and **SKU’ing** to make this easy for SEs to sell & deploy. **30 min in Orlando?**”
    
- **To Morty (Neo):**  
    “Welcome (soon) to my team. I want to keep **Neo first** while getting your eyes on shared control‑plane requirements. **15 min to align on priorities & time‑box**?”
    
- **To FWOD / Hari (SEs):**  
    “I’m setting **SE Office Hours** and building **top‑10 plays**. What 3 gaps hurt you most **today** on Azure/AWS/GCP? Can we chat **in Orlando**?”
    
- **To Brandon:**  
    “Scheduling a **monthly 30‑min** touchpoint. First session: my **one‑page multi‑cloud plan shape** + what ‘first‑class platform’ means in 90 days.”

---

If you want, I can turn the Confluence templates (FRD, strategy one‑pager, playbook) and the SFDC field schema into ready‑to‑paste docs next.
Reviewed org landscape and key players; aligned that Jason will deeply understand in‑flight opportunities, engage key partners, and architect a cloud strategy across major clouds. Agreed to move Carl to ProServe, use Confluence for FRDs, and for Jason to build relationships with SEs and set a monthly cadence with Brandon. Discussed PM maturity and future professionalization.

- Potential misalignment between RFPs (e.g., block/latency needs) and VAST strengths
- Roadmap trust concerns in some areas

## Open questions

- What is the precise scope split between Jason and Lior for deals vs. product requirements?
- Where exactly should FRDs and customer requirement docs live in Confluence (A.L./Tomer guidance)?
- What are Sagi’s near‑term priorities and gaps for cloud packaging and serverless?
- Is the upcoming Google RFP oriented to block/low‑latency workloads where NetApp is advantaged?
- What policy boundaries govern China sales activity for software‑only deals?
- Which SEs and overlays should be prioritized for deep engagement post‑Tech Summit?

[00:00:00.00]   Remote(keyboard clicking) I will see you in the next video. (keyboard clacking) (keyboard clacking) (shuffling) (paper rustling) I'll see you in the next video! (pen scratching) (silence)

[00:03:32.67]  Jason ValleryJeff. Hi, how are you? Are you in a hotel room in Salt Lake or did you go home?

[00:03:51.04]   RemoteI'm in a Salt Lake hotel room.

[00:03:54.13]  Jason ValleryHmm, fun.

[00:03:56.15]   RemoteOkay, let's get to work.

[00:04:00.06]  Jason ValleryYeah, I think there's three key things you wanted to talk about. You have onboarding things that I don't know about, and an org chart, and a parking lot. lot, and I'd love to go through all three of them. How do you want to start? Let's start with the org chart. Okay, I'll give you like, I'll try to save as many of your breaths as I can. I have had a few people walk me through it. So I'm sure you have a lot you want to share. I get, I got an understanding of Sahar's org. at least I understand the leaders and who key players are. I think I have, you know, I'd love your take on it to a certain extent. I don't know beyond, and I obviously have talked to Andy and Rob and others around customer success, CTO. I get a sense for what they do, but yeah, maybe if they're high-level bullets, you wanna make sure I know, I'd love to get that. You have the same problem I have, I can't get it to single sign me on, it's really annoying.

[00:05:05.30]   RemoteOh, I don't care.

[00:05:09.30]  Jason ValleryI like to save clicks. I'm still waiting for a fast data laptop. I'm running as a VM still.

[00:05:30.36]   RemoteYeah, this never works for me. Okay, so there's a guy in Marianne's group, Marianne runs marketing, named Aaron.

[00:05:53.79]  Jason ValleryMet him a couple times. I talked to him yesterday. Cool guy.

[00:05:56.76]   RemoteAll right. As best as I could tell, he is nobody that... understands cloud?

[00:06:02.10]  Jason ValleryI think Glenn brought me to his attention because he and I have been meeting, as he's been prepping for his session next week, at Tech Summit, and kind of walking through the end-to-end model builder pipeline, like the data pipeline, and kind of, you know, he's been getting a lot of my notes and feedback on that. He also gave me some of his decks that he's working on around, like the pillars, and I gave him a bunch of feedback around that. So hopefully that's been useful for him.

[00:06:30.15]   Remote- I think he's way too over rotated on building these pipelines. I mean, it's fixated on it, but that's a conversation I need to have with him. All right, so you're good there.

[00:06:45.51]  Jason ValleryYep.

[00:06:45.98]   RemoteWho's that guy? - Do you mean John?

[00:06:54.04]  Jason Vallery- I have on my to-do list to set up a one-on-one with him. I have not met him formally yet. We exchanged like a couple of Slack notes, but haven't actually spoken.

[00:07:00.72]   Remote- So John runs alliances, basically. Um, he's got people on his team that help with that. He's basically, if you have any questions about AMD or NVIDIA.

[00:07:25.59]  Jason Vallery- Okay. What's that Idsoc? I haven't even seen his name really. Who? Reporting to you, Idsoc?

[00:07:39.93]   RemoteIs that it? Idsoc is, he's a guy that's working on block storage. So, you know, we just offered we just brought that up and um text him um you know i want to get to a critical mass of i want to get to a critical mass of a business and um he's he's critical for that

[00:08:19.83]  Jason Valleryso uh okay here's it was interesting here have you met noah so we exchanged i tried to schedule with her and y'all um she wasn't able to make it but i did meet with y'all um so

[00:08:30.15]   RemoteAll right should meet noah do you have a uh Time on the books for when you're going out or no?

[00:08:39.97]  Jason ValleryYeah, basically the week of Thanksgiving, but I come home on Thanksgiving.

[00:08:45.81]   RemoteDo you know Sagi?

[00:08:47.81]  Jason ValleryNo, I do not know Sagi.

[00:08:51.01]   RemoteSo Sagi's building the pipelines product. He builds the serverless layer and things like that. One of the things that I think is really under-thought is how do I sell this within the cloud? Like, okay, I want to build a runtime, or I want to just have some C nodes, or I just want to do X, Y, Z. Let's say I want a GPU. How do I do that?

[00:09:14.00]  Jason ValleryYeah, I mean, this touches on product strategy quite a bit in terms of what you and I were talking about this week. I have a lot of thoughts I don't want to have. opinions until I've been here three months because I know better now, but I'd love to connect to Saki.

[00:09:27.54]   RemoteSo I think it's a) trying to figure out where their head's at and b) understanding what gaps we have as this applies to going into cloud, and it would be very, it would behoove you to spend some time with him. Okay, I'll reach out. Alone you know, who's on Alon's team? - Morty, oh, that's gonna change.

[00:09:47.81]  Jason Vallery- Yep, I haven't actually met Morty yet. Am I clear to kind of say hi to him?

[00:09:52.29]   Remote- Yeah, yep, yep, yep.

[00:09:54.57]  Jason Vallery- He knows that he's coming to my team now.

[00:09:58.41]   Remote- Yes. I may need that in a moment though. Okay. So Morty is mostly responsible for handling all the feature requirements in the Neo clouds. That's where most of our business comes today, so you don't get just to take him and pull him into support. you for OpenAI and Microsoft because that's what you're getting incentivized to do. He needs to do that. One of the things that Alone commented on is he thought, "Okay, Jason's going to be really good at driving strategy, but potentially some of the program stuff, Morty might be even instructed for you to figure out how things work here and what happens."

[00:11:15.39]  Jason Vallerybe. I mean, I don't want to digress too far on this topic, and we should have focused time for this. This is an area that I'm very interested in. Obviously, that's what I did at Microsoft, is build up product management teams and the structure and risk discipline and rigor like we talked about. I've talked a lot about this with Tomar. It's something I'd like to do here, regardless of org chart. It seems like... it's an area we need to focus, but it's also not the things you're putting on my to-do list,

[00:11:41.86]   Remoteso I don't know how important it is to you. It's as important as it relates to fixing things that are continually breaking down, and I think I don't want to solve problems that we don't have. and I know we need a lot more maturity. I'm not trying to even remotely represent that we don't. It's just, yeah, that's what I'd say about it, and I expect as time goes on, you'll be a lot more clear about the things that you think we need to change, and that's conversations. I really look forward to helping okay uh you know yeah we met a few times talked

[00:12:33.84]  Jason Vallerya few times I'm good good I don't know Dima deep team is a fixer he he has like

[00:12:47.16]   RemoteLike some amount of product. He's like a product owner. That makes sense?

[00:12:51.82]  Jason Vallery- Okay.

[00:12:52.90]   Remote- You know, he just goes in and either, you know, like what did he just recently do? He's, he's defining the networking for layer three. So it's, it's like, he's deep, deep, deep. He does a lot of escalations and he's got a few deep. that work with him to fix hard stuff.

[00:13:10.66]  Jason Vallery- Yeah. I know Asaf, I've had a couple of meetings with him. I've got more time scheduled with him. I know him.

[00:13:18.49]   Remote- Daphna, Daphna is kind of a program manager. She's a release manager for a lot of what we do. Leeraz also helps with that too.

[00:13:30.24]  Jason ValleryI've had one-on-one with Roz and got to know her a bit.

[00:13:34.27]   RemoteShe's cool.

[00:13:36.35]  Jason ValleryYeah, I like Brooks.

[00:13:38.40]   RemoteRoy is B-Force?

[00:13:40.34]  Jason ValleryI know what B-Force is, I haven't met with Roy yet. I get the strategy.

[00:13:45.33]   RemoteI don't think you need to meet with him just yet. Oren, Nadav, Aion... you met and then you'll give you'll give you'll get your fill of when you go to yeah I met with

[00:13:59.54]  Jason ValleryHim he wasn't able he was distracted and I think he was commuting or something it was always like that it's a it's a difficult call if I'm honest like I couldn't get a read and I didn't I don't I guess I need more time with it.

[00:14:15.30]   RemoteHe's not very social.

[00:14:16.76]  Jason Vallery- Yeah.

[00:14:18.31]   Remote- The least social person, and then when you meet him, he realizes he's just a little teddy bear.

[00:14:22.41]  Jason Vallery- Okay.

[00:14:23.25]   Remote- So you just have to go and sit and watch him in meetings and look at it. Okay, so that's that. But that's actually not where I wanted to take you. Oh, hold on one second. All right, goodnight ladies and gentlemen. Good night. Thank you. Good night.

[00:15:01.76]  Jason ValleryI find it weird to just, side note, why does Lior report to Jhansi, that feels weird to me.

[00:15:07.26]   RemoteUm, because Jhansi wants to also handle BizDev. Yeah. Don't worry about him.

[00:15:19.26]  Jason ValleryI don't want to.

[00:15:21.26]   RemoteSo let's talk about. Carl for a second.

[00:15:23.93]  Jason ValleryOh.

[00:15:24.77]   RemoteLior convinced me this morning that Carl is more of a liability than a help for you, and so...

[00:15:34.89]  Jason ValleryI mean, I'm sorry I didn't mean to interrupt. Go ahead. You tell me yours.

[00:15:41.61]   RemoteHe's basically not able to be put in front of customers just because he's... A little scattered. He's definitely doesn't have like sales acumen. So he just starts talking. He starts talking about all the stuff. He knows good bad and different

[00:15:52.27]  Jason ValleryYears written him off. Yeah, you can't listen. I have one on one with him before you even told me he might report to me just because he reached out to me when I first joined I was like, "Oh, hey, Carl, nice to meet you. What do you do here? I see you used to work for Microsoft. Let's connect some dots." I was very put off, I'll be honest. Like, he just kept interrupting me, which is exactly what I just did to you, but that was accidental. Yeah, I didn't get the right sense.

[00:16:21.90]   Remote- Okay, well, then let's park it. He's gonna go into ProServe working for Rob. 'Cause Rob has nobody on his team that understands cloud implementation, and yeah, he can build stuff, he can troubleshoot. It's not an architect. - Yeah.

[00:16:46.88]  Jason ValleryWhat's your take on Rob and his work generally? And not picking on Rob as an individual, structure and what they're doing. I met with him and I have a take but maybe it's premature. I'm just kind of curious where you think customer success is at last. Support.

[00:17:02.47]   RemoteIt's support. It's not, and he knows it, like everybody knows it. It's just called customer success but it's not. It's not customer success, it's just support.

[00:17:15.33]  Jason ValleryYeah proactive versus reactive is where I draw lines here and they feel very reactive not proactive. Is that your take?

[00:17:22.22]   RemoteYes Okay, then you have Rob yep, it's unclear to me how much he's actually driving the boat. He's basically the head of systems engineering. Look at all the people that report to him as systems engineers.

[00:17:46.14]  Jason ValleryYep. He's running tech summit next week, right? Or his team is. He is. Yeah, I had a one-on-one with him, and kind of, yeah, it was a little all over the place, but I think it was...

[00:18:00.33]   RemoteHe's drinking from the fire hose trying to pull NetApp moves in a decidedly not NetApp company.

[00:18:08.31]  Jason ValleryI don't know NetApp well enough to comment on what you just said, but I'm sure there's a bunch of underpins in that.

[00:18:16.46]   RemoteIt's OK. Um, nothing really important to say here other than I think... this is where this layer here is probably where you should have the best connection within the company. There's some exceptions to that like stack. I don't know if you really should trust the roadmap. Oh man, I hate these dynamic pages. Um, nope, not right. But yeah, Rick. Some of these guys are really good. These are the guys that are gonna make your success. Like Bridge House or, you really need to get deeply embedded with the SEs.

[00:19:05.35]  Jason Vallery>> This is next week, right? I mean, all of these guys will be-

[00:19:07.83]   RemoteSeminar soon. There'll be tons of them, yeah. Just Hari is maybe one of the best SEs we have in the company, he's layers down. Lupe, never even met her. Oh, I just met her, actually. Okay, well, you get the idea. There's not even... I can't even give you a blueprint that says go talk to this person, you have to talk to a lot of them.

[00:19:37.74]  Jason ValleryYeah, I mean ideally what happens is I build a brand that allows them to come talk to me so they know what I want to know about and they bring it to my attention.

[00:19:46.54]   RemoteWell I think it's more about what you want them to know about.

[00:19:49.58]  Jason ValleryIt's by direction for sure.

[00:19:52.85]   RemoteOkay. John runs partnerships, but basically like conventional channels, not clouds. We haven't considered them channels yet. I think that's the role that Lior wants to fill. Lior has people that work for him too.

[00:20:07.50]  Jason ValleryI met Tiffany, and is it Olivia, I think?

[00:20:13.84]   RemoteOlivia. Yeah, Olivia Kim. from Google. So there's a few important sales managers to know. Sunil runs all of APAC. Rich runs all of the EAST. He will talk to you about everything that's wrong in the world.

[00:20:26.87]  Jason ValleryIs he complaining about products? Does he complain about the product, institutional challenges, people, or just the weather?

[00:20:37.89]   RemoteMostly product, support, maturity, no he doesn't really talk about people much. Product and support. Gatty, Gatty's one of the best. He runs basically everything but APAC outside of the United States. States. Randy runs federal. He's hoping there's a lift that comes from the cloud partners this year. Google. Kartik actually doesn't run systems engineering anymore, so we've been cleaned up.

[00:21:23.13]  Jason ValleryWe met. You suggested I reach out. We had a one-on-one right before you went on vacation.

[00:21:26.88]   RemoteOkay. What was the topic?

[00:21:32.03]  Jason ValleryWell, you kicked it off on the TPU topic, and we talked about that, but we had more conversation than just Google. We talked about just general—it was a technical conversation, for sure. It's very technical. We probably touched on five different—

[00:21:45.38]   RemoteDimensions of that okay Ryan's team is responsible for basically they're an overlay team so I kind of secretly manage this one where they're responsible for taking database services out to market data engine services out to market and they do zero work the cloud. Actually they were participant in the Zscaler POC, but I think there's a lot of work that these guys can do once we have some platforms that we can robustly deploy upon. Okay, I haven't met Ryan. I'll reach out to him. I'd like to get to know. Yeah, he has a technical counterpart as Let's see in here. FWOD? So FWOD actually manages all the SEs. I thought ROP did. FWOD manages the database SEs. We call them the pipeline SEs. So he probably reports the ROP. If I'm not mistaken. Don't remember Bamboo's. an approximation of what we're doing. Eddie's team's all pretty great.

[00:22:58.89]  Jason ValleryI met with Justin on Eddie's team. Both of them seemed good.

[00:23:03.07]   RemoteJay you've met. Eric is basically Rick's right hand. Okay. So I think you'll find that Rick isn't, you know, too deep into the details. Eric is his like execution guy, his deal desk guy, and things like that, and Stacey...

[00:23:21.69]  Jason ValleryI don't want to... Also just... Eric was a good conversation. He seems like a good guy.

[00:23:28.40]   RemoteYeah, he is, and then Kristen runs enablement for the company.

[00:23:33.29]  Jason ValleryOkay.

[00:23:33.88]   RemoteSo she's got a team of people that are building programs, both external and internal. education stuff like that yeah let's climb back up the org chart see if we missed anybody interesting Amy counts the beans our meat hires people

[00:23:50.22]  Jason ValleryLet's go reports to Amy though right like so they're running there's a strategy component of what Amy's doing then yeah FP planning

[00:24:01.30]   RemoteSo I'm basically, you know, people turn to me for a lot of the strategy. I talked with T-Mose, who I was talking about earlier this week, about maybe bringing in some actually strategy people. They want to run that out of finance, I'm like, "I don't care."

[00:24:19.58]  Jason ValleryBut organizational strategy versus product strategy?

[00:24:22.98]   RemoteWell, that's all that I spent time talking with her or him about this week was not product. Actually, we didn't mention product strategy at all, it was all org strategy. Yeah. So. Yeah.

[00:24:41.46]  Jason ValleryMakes sense. I mean, obviously, I have a lot of opinions about product strategy, and I don't give a shit about organizational strategy, so hopefully we make those things a lot better. I mean, I care about organizational strategy, don't get me wrong, but it's not what I would focus on.

[00:24:58.44]   RemoteI would spend like an hour a month with Brandon if he can get on his calendar.

[00:25:04.49]  Jason ValleryI'd love to do that.

[00:25:06.47]   RemoteYeah. you'll get different perspectives. We drift from time to time.

[00:25:12.02]  Jason ValleryYou know, transparently, I've just kind of left the Ren and relationship. I haven't even pinged him since I joined. He sent me like one kind of welcome to Vastnode. But otherwise, I'm just fully aligning with you and trusting I'll get pulled in where I need to there.

[00:25:24.90]   RemoteGood. So you need to challenge that assumption. Go out of your way to just get on his calendar monthly, I would say.

[00:25:35.33]  Jason ValleryHow should I think about what Brandon cares about and wants to hear from me? I mean, obviously OpenAI and Microsoft, but I think a little bit more broadly than that.

[00:25:44.33]   RemoteI think he will care about us having a first-class platform for all the clouds. and all the things that are required to make that great, and the more that you can drive us towards there, and the more that that homogenizes over time with the neoclouds, it's even better. - Yeah.

[00:26:12.12]  Jason Vallery- But we agree.

[00:26:15.50]   RemoteSome time ago, we need to really, the market we're operating in is limited. We need cloud as another vector of growth, and that was one of the reasons we were excited to hire you.

[00:26:27.76]  Jason Vallery- You've tap danced around, you and Renan don't always see eye to eye on things, and that's natural. Can you elaborate on like areas of friction and areas of agreement? Not trying to be political either, it's just, I don't really, I don't really know.

[00:26:57.25]   RemoteOh, I'll give you a good example. he's in China right now. I told him to go, so he went. He's there and he's feeling a little uncomfortable because he feels like it's wrong for the current tone on China. The market's like, "I don't know if we should push for this. It might be bad for our posture with the administration or this and that." I said, "I don't agree with you. If Jensen the go-ahead to sell in China he'd be selling his balls off right now and we don't have the restrictions that he has like he's just a capitalist and you're being a little baby so you know he's the boss he gets to override but um we don't always see eye to eye and that's

[00:27:41.42]  Jason ValleryThat's good yeah i mean my thoughts in China if you give it to about in my sense. It's software only, so it's less of a risk. I wouldn't go into China if it meant spending CAPEX or big investments, but if you're selling a license key to China, well, why not? But I wouldn't put any dollars behind it because it's just long-term. They're going to either kick you out or you're going to end up with a bad... I don't think that CAPEX... anywhere. I mean, even building out like headcount and teams and offices to try to do motions there. There's tons of money. There's tons of money. Yeah, and Microsoft, we just went through some major pain around this. We had operations teams in China, we had dev centers in China, and all of that had to close. like the Azure storage had operations running out of China and we were forced to close shops it was very painful so I would just say like we don't want to get

[00:28:39.92]   Remotein that situation. I agree should be a sales outpost yeah you know the the company that we're competing with is IBM on GPFS there and it's like nobody's going in and trying to just take the building business. It's nuts. So anyway, I told him, I said, honestly, if you put a press lease tomorrow saying you closed ByteDance for an Exabyte, another CoreWeave,

[00:29:03.37]  Jason ValleryThen nobody would get mad at that. I can tell you, I mean, I worked on ByteDance. They're in Azure. They are only in Azure for the GPUs, and they had crazy throughput And you know what they ended up doing is they ended up building a big fat pipe to a ByteDance data center in Equinix in Ashburn and they're running their own storage platform there, and then they interconnect that back to GPUs running in US East Azure because Azure storage couldn't cut it, like it just couldn't hit their throughput targets, and it was easier for them to just connect a big multi-terabit WAN between data centers. than it was for them to try and use Azure Storage.

[00:29:41.93]   RemoteOK. I'm going to file that under information I'll never be able to use again.

[00:29:46.76]  Jason ValleryYeah. Me too.

[00:29:48.11]   RemoteThank you.

[00:29:50.74]  Jason ValleryThe point is, it's another proof point that Microsoft knows Azure Storage can't cut.

[00:29:56.34]   RemoteOK. Well, that should be spending-- you should be spending more of your time saying,

[00:30:00.56]  Jason ValleryThat's exactly what I'm focused on. That's every meeting I'm making with Microsoft right now. Got a lot of positive updates there. I won't share them until there's a more cohesive narrative, but I'm making good progress.

[00:30:11.53]   RemoteThat's cool. Great, great, great, great, great. I really want that like crisp slide that just is like that dagger that you kind of dig into them every day, just saying like, you know, guys could have. Yep, and I talked along with Lior today earlier about how like we can run this play in a lot of other clouds. He goes, well, I can't until I have like an Apollo opportunity. I said, sure you can. You like, you just have to think through pretty simple things. Like who benefits if Vast enters into Oracle or AWS? And he couldn't, he couldn't. really think through that well enough very much like does whatever is right in front of him and

[00:30:50.98]  Jason Valleryi think he needs help getting to like the higher level of strategy of planning i like leo i feel like maybe he's he doesn't have like the the system's understanding to connect the dots like i don't i think he's he's clearly a bd guy and that's obviously the role he's in I don't know if he understands the internal intricacies of what it takes to deliver a system like this at a cloud that then allows you to extend to who do I have to influence?

[00:31:17.26]   Remote- Yes. I'm not sure I do, by the way, either, but he very much is like, whatever's in front of him is the thing that he can focus on. Okay.

[00:31:30.55]  Jason ValleryYou have a generic bullet of onboarding shit I was supposed to do.

[00:31:40.33]   RemoteI don't know. So you got your computer? I haven't hired anybody in a while, so. I didn't. Well, this was my choice.

[00:31:45.29]  Jason ValleryI wanted a MacBook and they just released the M5 and so I told Duck, "Can I get an M5?" get it, and so I just sent him a note and said, "Oh, give me an M4, it's fine." So he said he would order it today or tomorrow. Right now I'm running on my personal MacBook on a VM on Windows, which is fine and dandy, but I prefer to keep separation of concerns clean.

[00:32:04.58]   RemoteI have an M4 and it is exquisite.

[00:32:08.98]  Jason ValleryThat's what I have right now is an M4 MacBook Pro, but it's mine from previous time.

[00:32:15.57]   Remoteit so yeah okay um oh here's something that so so there's just like a ton of stuff confluence is a is a is a rabbit hole that you can go down any time you're bored um a lot of design architecture stuff like i think that's the one thing that you're going to have to get really sharp on is like, why were certain design decisions made? Some of that's articulated in Confluence. Um, you asked about this thing. I feel like my computer has just gotten this new personality.

[00:32:55.83]  Jason ValleryMaybe Siri's actually going to do something useful.

[00:33:00.58]   RemoteUh, it's really Chrome, like it doesn't remember me from anything previous. So let me copy this URL, tell me if you can get this copy, and I'm just going to copy this URL, and I'm just going to paste it in there.

[00:33:40.58]  Jason ValleryI tell you, the productivity stack here is probably my biggest learning curve. It's not institutional, not organizational product strategy stuff. It's figuring out how to use Google Drive, Google Suite, Zoom, Slack, Atlassian, all of these different tools. from the last 23 years of my life, I've spent using Microsoft end-to-end, and I just am, yeah, in a learning curse.

[00:34:06.52]   Remote- I can fully appreciate that one. I reject the use of Google Slides for what it's worth.

[00:34:12.01]  Jason Vallery- Shit, I tried using it, and I immediately switched back to PowerPoint.

[00:34:15.57]   Remote- So we also have an Office 365 account.

[00:34:17.21]  Jason ValleryI got it. But like, you know, obviously it doesn't work for my email and calendar and shit. I missed an important meeting because I didn't have notifications figured out. I was like, fuck, like, I didn't get notified of that damn meeting because I didn't know how Google,

[00:34:26.60]   RemoteI'm still learning. Um, yeah, you know, what I use is, um, Apple calendar.

[00:34:30.24]  Jason ValleryWell, I need, I need like a Mac book that I can connect to do that. Otherwise, Yeah, I'm with her.

[00:34:36.06]   Remote- But the crazy thing is I have to set meetings using the Google Calendar web UI. - Yeah. - And then the Apple Calendar is a client on my desktop, provides notifications and stuff like that.

[00:34:46.07]  Jason Vallery- I'll get there. I mean, one of the things like not to sell teams because it's shit in many ways, unified app that you've got your calendar in, your meetings in, your follow-up tasks, links to your doc, like it's all in one place. Everything's just so scattered to the winds here, it's interesting.

[00:35:04.50]   RemoteI agree. So you were opining earlier about how can't beat flash XYZ we built this thing that allows you to actually go in and size relative capability so let's say I'm building an exabyte my power cost is

[00:35:29.44]  Jason Vallery15 kilowatts an hour these are all rational no those aren't why I won't on all of it, but I'll tell you like... Oh, I'm just talking about an average customer.

[00:35:44.91]   RemoteOkay. I understand. I talked to a customer yesterday, he's paying six cents, so I...

[00:35:50.95]  Jason ValleryNo, you see, like a blob storage rack, it's 14 kilowatts, not 40 kilowatts.

[00:35:54.63]   RemoteOkay, that's why there's tools here. You just go fiddle.

[00:35:59.76]  Jason ValleryYeah.

[00:36:00.66]   RemoteThe average cost per terabyte 28 cents for 16 terabytes I don't think so 30 say $200 a terabyte power per drive that's also wildly high

[00:36:14.90]  Jason ValleryI mean I get the point it's a calculator yeah yeah and you can just

[00:36:23.16]   RemoteRun it and generate a model and it'll show you where the inflection point is hard drive to SSDs

[00:36:29.98]  Jason Valleryup front cost is higher but operational costs are lower did you put the message i would actually like to play with it it looks fun yeah i just send it to you via slack okay one of the five places you could send me an im great yes I'll follow-up. Yeah, I mean, obviously I don't want to rattle on this right now. I think the industry is going to hit that tipping point on hard drives. I just don't think we're there yet, as you are convinced we are. There's also supply chain components of it.

[00:37:23.80]   RemoteSure. Okay, so we've got that. What else is important? see schedule, I can throw that away. No, I can't wait. Um, round F, Grafana. I've got

[00:37:39.23]  Jason ValleryUplink going. I assume that's what Grafana means in that context. I've been in there playing with it. I haven't found like exactly what I want to learn out of it. But I've got it accessed and I'm played with it and I know how to use it and I'm already familiar with using Grafana so I can build a dashboard if I wanted. Do you have a Salesforce account? I do. I looked at the loss review stuff. I mean, there's a lot of interesting things I can go spend cycles that is really the segue to the parking lot of which direction you want to send me off on in the next couple months and what you want me to focus on like is it loss reviews on BCDR or is it

[00:38:12.18]   RemoteYou know you know exactly so that's not how much free time you have well

[00:38:18.44]  Jason ValleryI mean, let me just sell you the vision.

[00:38:21.29]   RemoteSaying that just assumes that whatever you're going to do is going to consume 100% of your time. That's not always how it happens and it also doesn't help you appreciate why and how we sell.

[00:38:30.94]  Jason ValleryHere's how I sell, like what I want to focus on and how I bring the most value, right? All of these things I think I can have you impact on. I want to have the most at-bat opportunities that you'll give me to demonstrate my value to you and Renan. I want to make sure that I become such an important part of VAST that I'm indispensable and I'm on this journey with you guys, and so for me it's not under it's a bit about understanding what moves the needle for you, what moves the needle for Renan, and so I want those at bad opportunities, like, I'm happy to go spelunking BCDR losses if you think that's moving the needle for you and running, but I don't think it really is, and so I want to make sure I'm focusing myself on the ways I can have the most impact given my experience, knowledge, and abilities. I am 100%, 110% going to give you as much of myself as I can. as I can, particularly in these early phases while we're getting to know each other and you can build trust in me. That's my goal.

[00:39:31.04]   RemoteSo, I think you need a little bit of vast philosophy. It's going to take me a second to do what I want to do here. but give me a second here. - Sure. - 'Cause I need to. I'm going to go ahead and close the webinar and open it up to the public for questions. you If this doesn't work, then it's a lot of waiting for nothing.

[00:40:58.04]  Jason ValleryI'm expecting something fantastic.

[00:41:01.80]   RemoteIt's not going to be, given how long this is taking. Oh my God. I'll have to find it. I would say we're people that like to get our hands dirty, and the reason for that is that if you work in the theoretical, you don't always... appreciate what's actually happening, and so the simple message is that well you know it's it's nice to kind of like have all of the principle and all the theory you know sometimes you just have to like roll up your hands and do some shit and that's the long and short of what I wanted to say.

[00:42:04.20]  Jason Vallery- I mean, that's my philosophy as well. Particularly, like this is the thing that has infuriated me in product management, and this is very true of Microsoft. You've got people who want to come and talk about business value and, I don't know, an AI pipeline. have never actually seen an AI pipeline with their own eyes and hands. They have theoretical knowledge of how they work, but they ever actually tried this themselves? Have they ever actually played with the technology? And it means they're trying to set strategy on something where they've not actually been able to experience it, and that's just a complete mess, and this is actually very institutional, Microsoft, 'cause they end up hiring a lot of like, our product managers are gonna be MBA grants. Great, you can go set pricing strategy, but how are you actually gonna decide what's important to build into the engineering roadmap? And that's a big missing link, right? You want people that actually are at heart, geeks, like they like to play with technology and know where the pain points are and all of the layers in the stack, and if you don't have that background, it's really hard to define what you're building.

[00:43:15.98]   Remote- These were our systems. We used to just sit on a data floor in the middle of New York and make this stuff, and there wasn't like, what needed to be done. Yeah, and so when it came time to have a conversation about how the drives work or something like that, we also knew. We knew how they were manufactured. We knew, to your point, like it wasn't some MBA, like they'd already done the stuff.

[00:43:47.43]  Jason ValleryYeah. I think I told you I spent my entire summer writing code with Codex. and Anthropic Claw and other models too. But if you're not playing around with these things, how can you advise people on how to use them? And that relates to the customer journey too. So even if you're not getting your hands dirty on it, like I've never built a multi-table by Data Lake, but I've sat down with customers who have and understood how it works and what their pain points are. I think you learn from those experiences, and so a good product manager to me is somebody who can come in and speak authoritatively about the thing they own, but also ask the right questions and learn through the process and sit next to the customer. I'll tell you, I'm still learning the product team around here, but I don't think you have a product team. I think you have a bunch of people that are kind of like pushing things around. based on other people who were influencing and driving.

[00:44:42.64]   Remote- Which is the product team?

[00:44:44.89]  Jason Vallery- Well, I mean, they're not, they're not driving. They're listening to what other people are telling them to do.

[00:44:55.89]   Remote- I'm saying those other people are the product team.

[00:45:00.82]  Jason Vallery- Yeah, exactly, but then it's not like organized.

[00:45:05.78]   Remote- I agree. - Yeah. - That's why you have to go to Israel to understand the dynamic. - Yeah. Yeah. - Okay. So, I think that's it for.

[00:45:23.58]  Jason ValleryKind of whatever stuff like we're passed onboarding yes congratulations you've been onboarded great

[00:45:35.88]   RemoteYeah what else what did i put in the parking lot

[00:45:42.60]  Jason ValleryYeah you put some bullets in there um you know obviously one of the things that I'm pushing you towards, and we don't have to make decisions today, is like, really, for me, I thrive in an area where I've got clear scope and ownership. Like, what's mine? What do I count on other people for? The top items in your parking lot look like Lior tasks, not product management tasks. Obviously, I understand. Well, I mean, I certainly want to understand the deals in in flight, that's a key part of product management, but managing. backlog of deals is not something that PMs typically would do.

[00:46:12.28]   RemoteI didn't say manage a backlog of deals. I want you to catalogue all of the in-flight opportunities in terms of what is required from a product perspective. All of this is through the lens of, do you actually have a clue of what people are trying to do with our product and what we need to build in order to build something

[00:46:35.32]  Jason ValleryThat gets a lot of money.

[00:46:37.52]   RemoteSure, and so I'm not expecting you to be a Salesforce admin, but I'm expecting you to understand the deal flow and what the projects are that we're working on, which ones you recommend we walk away from, which ones you want to.

[00:46:53.48]  Jason Vallerygo and repeat like you need to connect to what the fuck is happening. Yeah 100% I mean I think I'm doing that. I think that I can do better I'm sure. But then it also it also translates to

[00:47:09.78]   RemoteTalking to the customers that are that are considering us for these opportunities and by definition, you cannot be far along in this because you've only been here for like two weeks, so.

[00:47:21.23]  Jason Vallery- I hit the ground running, man. I've been in meetings with several customers already with Leora and otherwise, I'm hitting the ground running. Yeah, I mean, if I think back on my early days in Azure, like obviously today it's a very different case, but, you know, in my early days in Azure, that's what it was, we were building a business, and, you know, in order to do that, that meant product was involved in every large pursuit. We wanted to hear exactly where the pain was, what the scenarios were. I mean, this is how I ended up... It was such a wild ride because every regulated industry, every different random use case in different verticals and scenarios and all of those things, they came with interesting problems that we had to go and solve in the cloud or didn't solve, as it may be, and that was definitely like a five-year journey in the early half of my time.

[00:48:06.17]   Remote- Yeah. I think there's going to be an element of that here too.

[00:48:11.32]  Jason VallerySo we need to build up our product practice. - I just want to make it clear about me. I don't know if this week was a great representative example of how I operate, but I love to go. in and own a customer meeting and I love to go in and I thrive in that environment. I love asking them questions and I love learning from that. That's an area and honestly that's probably the reputation and brand I built most in Blob Storage over the years with the leadership is I was the guy that like they could just send me off to go meet with some strategic customer and come back with really good intelligence and lead a meeting and build their

[00:48:45.92]   Remotein Microsoft. I understand. You were driving some conversations that were unrelated to the meeting that was trying to be had. Yeah. But I understand, so you know, in those cases you got framed meetings that were for a purpose of doing the thing that you needed to do, and you know, the ride-along this week, you're just there. kind of inquisitive and that's fine so so I get it I get it I appreciated watching work we need to we need to get super specific about the customers that we want and the ones that we want to go repeat and drive very very targeted

[00:49:24.44]  Jason ValleryConversations there yeah okay okay so I mean just clear scope an ownership from me versus Lior, I'm not going to go build a backlog in Salesforce and report out opportunities. I'm going to go make sure Lior pulls me into the right meetings and I'm going to

[00:49:40.88]   RemoteKnow what's in flight. I think you need to understand what the pipeline is. You need to understand what the feature requirements are that surround the pipeline. You need to presume that it's never just, "Hey, somebody needs a working system." AWS there's an interplay between all the different places that they have their data today and what have you. That Walmart example was, you know, acute but not probably that removed from how most customer conversations will go going forward because they already have large cloud investments. they have large cloud data repositories. We need to think about the value add services that we want to offer to that customer and how those configurations can be built within these new foreign environments for us. We need to start planning on the cloud pushes that we want to make and the different product intersections that we want to drive so that we can get lift, you know, let's say it's foundry. Okay. Well, how do we, how do we embed ourselves into foundry? And that's a, that's a combined product management, sales and strategy discussion. How do we embed ourselves in a foundry that there's just natural pull is like a, um, vast is the foundation of maybe a silent foundation of a first party service, et cetera, et cetera.

[00:51:02.16]  Jason ValleryThat's a tricky one. We need the right sponsorship to make founder work.

[00:51:06.40]   RemoteI agree, and I'm using that as an example. There's Bedrock, there's Vertex, there's other stuff. Like we need plans for these clouds, which isn't just like, "Here's some S3, because

[00:51:18.63]  Jason Vallerywe're going to get our dicks kicked in." a product strategy conversation we need to have because the cloud is a hoster and for lack of a better you know that's really what the fund fundamentals are so it's much more of like how do we align with the strategies of Microsoft a lot on a lot of Google up it's not just the cloud piece of it it's much more than that and then where do we see our unique And I said this in the email with Renan is like, where do we compliment? Where do we compete? That like, we need to have that clean delineation in our own minds.

[00:51:55.71]   Remote- Okay, well, that's up for you to architect. Nobody else is gonna do it. - Yeah.

[00:52:01.45]  Jason ValleryWell, it's an end-to-end story though, because it includes the on-premises piece and the existing customer base and the broader strategy.

[00:52:08.48]   Remoteof course. So you have to presume that as part of what you're doing, but you know, I still think it's your, your strategy to drive. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and then as we kind of extend out into the stuff that Morty's working on, we need to the point that I was having earlier, like a canonical control plane that is feature rich, or a set of control planes that are feature rich. So this is one of the things that I want you to talk to John about, is we need to drive an agenda where you can have a cloud in a box, and John owns the partnerships with the different control plane companies, G Corp, Ori, Arna, and Rafe. We need to professionalize how we do this Tier 2 cloud. They're never going to have their own product management. They're never going to be good. But the question is, how can you put, to the point earlier about a full AI pipeline, how can you put a full AI pipeline solution in a box so that you can take it to pharmas who just got $10 billion? is their first order, and say, OK, well, now it's time to build this out and make sure that your customers have all the right services that they need.

[00:53:23.42]  Jason ValleryYeah. Yeah, for sure. I see that as a key opportunity. I think we've got the right foundations there, but there's a lot of gap. So what are they doing, and what's the open source ecosystem? I don't know if these conversations are happening and if you have a sense, but all of these companies that are just coming into existence now, or at least coming into awareness now, they must be already having these conversations. What are they turning to? There must be some sort of without us plan. What is that?

[00:53:57.70]   RemoteThey're not. They're not.

[00:53:59.75]  Jason ValleryThey're just like, we're going to go. sped up some dgx and flip a power switch and hand it over and say good luck that's all they do yeah yeah i mean this goes back to what i was hinting at when we were at nvidia i don't think we got to really explain this conversation but like shouldn't nvidia show up with this like why isn't nvidia showing up and saying here's your cloud in a box mr dgx ncp

[00:54:23.53]   Remoteso they say they're getting better at this but they're still very far behind and it's they don't want to take preference on technology recommendations

[00:54:32.17]  Jason ValleryOther than chips and networks so like you've got to have a control plane and an orchestration environment and like even setting aside if they're not going to pick a storage vendor they should be able to be like here's how you deploy kubernetes and build a control plane and manage the infrastructure like they have to have some opinions about how to glue it all together they have some it's not as robust as you'd expect

[00:54:57.58]   Remoteso these are good conversations to have with john i think you should bring morty in on it too because i want to i want to make it um you know a an alliance driven strategy where we have to like these platform players and we have to own the fact that they can represent our product well when, you know, they get called in to be an orchestration for GPU as a service. Well, sure, but there's more there and we can get greater consumption.

[00:55:23.99]  Jason ValleryYeah. Okay, well, that's my separate time with John. Get to know him and then I'll pull Morty in. All right. Any other guidance, feedback, work items, backlog?

[00:55:40.17]   RemoteNo, I just wanted to, I just wanted to have enough work for you to kind of, and it is busy work to start to some extent, but enough work to a) give you an appreciation for all the flows in the field. product and how the customers are viewing it and reviewing it. Notice I didn't put in the list of things to do the loss analysis. That's a, you know, that's a Salesforce pull at minimum.

[00:56:07.30]  Jason Vallery>> I did actually, I mean, I went and read through all the BCDR ops that.

[00:56:11.15]   Remote>> No, but it wasn't just BCD, it wasn't, the conversation was not about BCDR. the product management team needs to understand where we're winning and where we're losing full stop, and you can say, well, that's not cloud. I don't give a fuck what you think about that, because the product is what a product is. The cloud is just a platform. You know what I mean? And so if we need this type of SMB signing, that problem will, will, um, plague us both in, in, you know, WS as well as on some Dell server, wherever the hell else, and that's where I think having a good function within product management tied closely to sales strategy and sales operations like let's do routine win loss analysis on a regular base. let's take a step back after the end of the quarter. I think that's a really good thing to do.

[00:57:04.69]  Jason Vallery- 100%, we did it. Like this is, I mean, I started to touch on this, but we ran a rhythm of business that included a monthly business review, and the monthly business review included highlights, lowlights, wins and losses, and we would have looked every, on every deal of consequence that came through our awareness as why did we win? Why did we lose? What were the gaps? was, you know, I mean, fundamentally, like, I don't want to get on some high horse, but like there needs to be a structured, top-down product, rhythm of business, all of these things together, that ties how we set objectives and goals, the work that we're doing, the planning that we're doing, the prioritization framework for the planning, what data feeds that, what the results are as a, as, as. an execution rhythm, and then you build out meeting cadences around this. You have buy-in from all of the executive team to come and pay attention and give feedback. Like, unless you want to put all of that structure and discipline, it feels a little ad hoc and chaotic, but I mean, I'm willing to run things until I learn the vast way. I won't opinions for three months, but I know how I would do it.

[00:58:08.93]   RemoteAnd I'd also say that the way that you would do it would require another 10 people.

[00:58:13.75]  Jason ValleryI don't know about 10 people, but what I would want is that you have PMs that are deeply aware of the area that you carve up for them and give them clean swimweights, and that may mean that you need more than you've got. Honestly, I don't have. take on that yet. It may mean that you repurpose folks you've got because you've changed the way those swim lanes are organized, but it certainly isn't the current structure of things.

[00:58:41.22]   RemoteOkay, so I've gotten that from you now twice. Notice that I've registered it. I understand what you're saying, and I want to give you just a little bit more time to bake it.

[00:58:53.61]  Jason ValleryI'm not trying to build a kingdom. I just wanna make sure that you set me up with where I can have the most value and I have clean responsibilities, and right now I've got a backlog of to-do list I'll focus on and I'll be happy with that, but yeah.

[00:59:07.67]   Remote- But I don't wanna lose sight of that conversation because professionalizing product management is a big ticket item. for me this coming year, and that's one of the reasons that we were excited to bring you in as well. It's not to say it's not something we're going to talk about. It's just to say I want you

[00:59:26.39]  Jason Valleryto settle in a little more. All in. However you want to use it. Yeah, and I mean, I get the sense that even if it's not an organizational thing, I get the sense that Tomer has the same frustrations,

[00:59:37.23]   RemoteThank you. Tomer's challenges are different. You'll see those as time goes on.

[00:59:45.62]  Jason VallerySure. Should I be spending any time with Tomer's team? I have intentionally kind of left that alone because I don't want to bring chaos there, but...

[00:59:52.62]   RemoteYou're going to need them for some things, so at some point, yes, I'll let you... working as you need you know jonathan andy doesn't i don't think andy unless we start chipping hardware into microsoft or something like that you're not going to need andy um tomer uh well i should say jonathan is just processing rfes and so that's um he doesn't have a domain necessarily He's just, you know, he's kind of like managing field requests and making sure that they get the respect that they need. Tomer's kind of like, you know, handling roadmap briefings and general stuff and then you've got proceed that is essentially focused on trying to define what we do going forward with pipeline oriented database oriented. stuff. So if you think about the the capabilities of product and the size of the PM team it's very big product very small PM team. Yeah, and I don't know if this is an organization that will ever build a very large PM team. Yeah. But you know I can see there's a few things within there that you will require as time goes on to have like you know good relationships with and you'll have dependencies on so yeah you have to work

[01:01:16.83]  Jason ValleryWith them how much you work with them that's up to you yeah I was it is a very as a proportion of the dev team tiny team I don't know you when you think about though that many of the functions of traditional product management are spread through other parts of vast but you know Microsoft it's budgeted as a 7 to 1 ratio. 7 deaths to 1 PM. When you talk about those kind of numbers,

[01:01:39.08]   Remoteit's a very different world, right? Yeah, yeah. Microsoft also has a very different capital structure than we have.

[01:01:53.72]  Jason ValleryI mean, it's just a different way that PMs get deployed to, and that ratio is shifting less. So I would say like more recent headcount is probably more 10 to 1, but organizationally, it varies somewhat across different parts of Microsoft. But that is like a top-down, Satya-level engineering kind of guidance thing, not an Azure or Office or Xbox kind of thing, right? like institutional thing.

[01:02:19.53]   RemoteBe sure to tell Shahar that and record his reaction.

[01:02:25.61]  Jason ValleryYeah, well one thing you connected with,

[01:02:32.61]   Remotego ahead, and you've connected with him?

[01:02:35.66]  Jason ValleryYeah, yeah, yeah I just.

[01:02:40.65]   RemoteConnect to the Sahar. It's hard to say for me. I'll get there. I think in terms of where you put notes, I'm going to hate to say this, but as they become more granular, a lot of the real customer requirements stuff, a lot of the FRDs, they go into confluence. So I appreciated you writing up the Walmart stuff. But that's... Over time, that's where the engineers will go to reference these things once you get to a point where it becomes engineering-level, well I should say engineering-respected documentation.

[01:03:16.18]  Jason ValleryMakes sense. I'll get Tim to walk me through how they sort things and confluence and make sure I'm using the process.

[01:03:23.69]   RemoteYeah, I would talk to A.L. about that, like, "Hey, you know, we've got these things coming. Where would you want them to be put?" Talk to Tomer. The problem is, you know, when some of Tomer's guys came in, they thought of themselves as architects and they had no idea how the product was architected, much less how, you know, what the customer was actually asking for. So there was a bit of... a bit of friction in their early days because you know they kind of came in as the the beacons of the company and they just they just weren't sufficient enough for what the engineering team needed to really build yeah so

[01:04:21.31]  Jason ValleryYou want to find good technical people that you can mature into a product manager versus hiring people that are, like I said, MBAs. I don't know what their backgrounds are. I'm not commenting on any specific person because I don't know them, but I think that's the...

[01:04:31.60]   RemoteAndy was a sysad. Jonathan was a support escalations engineer. Tomer's background, I think he's largely been product management for quite some time, and Proceed is same, PM for a long time. Yeah. Okay. Anything else?

[01:04:48.81]  Jason ValleryNo. What can I do for you? This was helpful. Um, you know, I live on, you know, making sure I'm keeping you happy, and that means I've got good feedback that I'm doing the right thing and the wrong thing. So keep course correcting me and we'll work together. Well, good, good.

[01:05:08.71]   RemoteOkay. Well, if you need anything, I'm here.

[01:05:10.31]  Jason ValleryAll right. Thank you, sir. Uh, what's your schedule for next week? Are you in Orlando? Which days?

[01:05:16.24]   RemoteI have to be in Orlando between Tuesday through Thursday and a lot of that's going to be spent just doing sales strategy. I'm not going to Orlando for the Tech Summit. I'm just going because there's people there.

[01:05:35.57]  Jason ValleryI see. Well, hopefully we get a chance to connect there. Monday through Wednesday and then I'm going to do this thing with a loan on Thursday and hopefully

[01:05:43.74]   Remotea Walmart thing emerges too, and the thing with a loan on Thursday was where? Google. Google. That's for this RFP? Yeah. Are you helping with that? What? Yes, for sure.

[01:06:01.23]  Jason ValleryI'm not the pin. I would like to, I talked to Yancey about it this morning, he certainly has the take that it is the TPU opportunity in disguise and that's my shared view, and so Thursday we'll get an opportunity to meet with Google's leadership and ask a lot of questions. and hopefully on the other side of that we'll have a better sense on which direction to take the RFP. Right now if you take it on face value it's not super

[01:06:33.54]   RemoteExciting but I think there's more there than we're here. Okay well NetApp makes a pretty damn good product and they have a lot of features we don't. Latency is way way way better for block I/O. So, let's just make sure that it's not that type of project.

[01:06:50.42]  Jason Vallery- Yeah, otherwise we might be just wasting our time.

[01:06:53.29]   RemoteYeah. - I agree.

[01:06:55.53]  Jason Vallery- Yeah.

[01:06:56.37]   Remote- Okay. Well, thank you, sir.

[01:07:00.17]  Jason Vallery- Thank you.

[01:07:01.78]   Remote- See you next week.

[01:07:02.63]  Jason Vallery- Yeah, bye.

[01:07:08.91]   Remote(keyboard clacking) (keyboard clacking) I'm going to go ahead and close the webinar. We'll see you in a minute. OK, so I'm going to go ahead and

[01:09:01.35]  Jason ValleryAnd I'm telling you, it's complicated, and then we have to pick all of us from school early to be to the 315 appointment at the post office, and then Jamie said you're going to pick him up in Boulder at 5 o'clock.

[01:09:23.84]   RemoteSo what I was going to suggest is we finish up the quote and we go over to Patty and George's

[01:09:39.07]  Jason ValleryAnd depending on where they're at, maybe I follow you over to the reciting center at

[01:09:46.30]   RemoteEqual or it's just a flat box and it's a lot easier to get stuck in there.

[01:10:04.30]  Jason ValleryAnd I'm sure, I'm sure Sean would follow a little bit of their intention. job and with this kind of direction. The other option is you can take Bluebeats. They are.

[01:10:16.82]   RemoteYou can buy something free from.

[01:10:24.18]  Jason ValleryI mean, from. You just may have to help with unloading the box to do that. Fair? Fine. You have my time free from three onwards. So, I will be ready to go to the concert by three, then I will leave on the right foot. So you have me from three to four thirty, and that includes the trip to the post office, and I just want to be cleaned out on the four thirty. As long as you're willing to help me get to work. Four thirty. But between four and four thirty, I agree.

[01:10:53.82]   Remote(silence) (claps)Pause for group workBLANK Thank you very much.
