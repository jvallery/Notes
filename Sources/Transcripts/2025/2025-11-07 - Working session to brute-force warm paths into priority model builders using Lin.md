# Warm intros and outreach planning for model builders
**Date:** 2025-11-07 · **Project:** Model Builder Turbine · **Folder:** Projects/Model Builder Turbine

> [!summary] Status Summary (toward next milestone)
Working session to brute-force warm paths into priority model builders using LinkedIn mutuals, investor links, and NVIDIA/NeoCloud contacts. Targets reviewed included Thinking Machines, Reflection, Physical Intelligence, Midjourney, SSI (Safe Superintelligence Inc.), Perplexity, Cohere, Magic, Anthropic, and Apple. The team identified specific connectors (e.g., Glenn Lockwood, Christian Gibson, Robert Brooks at Lambda, Grant Lee, Aaron Batillo at CoreWeave, Rory and NVIDIA’s David Klein, Henry Perez) and agreed to pivot messaging toward concrete pipeline components (e.g., scalable Kafka for RL, real-time vector DB) and to involve data/pipeline teams, not only execs. An AI Circle event with NVIDIA customers will be advanced to create neutral ground for intros. Several investor vectors (Bond, One Prime Capital/Ankan) will be tested. Some outreach threads are cooling (e.g., Zara thread) and hyperscaler conflicts may limit certain intros. Action items were assigned to pursue intros, refine outreach content with the pipelines team, and audit Salesforce histories. Additional labs (e.g., Black Forest Labs) will be explored opportunistically while staying focused on the top funded near-term buyers.

## Key Facts (scope, metrics, links)
- Purpose: map warm intro paths and assign outreach for priority model builders.
- Key targets: Thinking Machines, Reflection, Physical Intelligence, Midjourney, SSI, Perplexity, Cohere, Magic, Anthropic, Apple.
- Thinking Machines contacts: Mile Ott (AI/infra), Christian Gibson; connector: Glenn Lockwood.
- Reflection contact: Giannis; connector via Robert Brooks (Lambda).
- Perplexity contacts: Kevin Wu, Tony Wu, Noah Yonick; possible connector: Grant Lee.
- SSI contact: Daniel Levy; Alon has prior touchpoints; need quick read on other SSI contacts.
- Cohere contact: Phil (acting CTO, UK); Magic contact: Eric (CEO); connector: Aaron Batillo (CoreWeave).
- Midjourney founder: David Holz; possible path via Henry Perez (Google).
- NVIDIA path: Rory to NVIDIA rep David Klein for select accounts; expect event-based intros vs 1:1.
- Messaging shift: lead with pipeline components (Kafka for RL, real-time vector DB) and engage data teams.

## Outcomes (progress this session)
- Identified specific connectors for each target account and assigned owners to pursue intros.
- Agreed to craft targeted outreach around scalable Kafka for RL and real-time vector DB instead of generic 'AI OS' messaging.
- Agreed to engage data/pipeline teams alongside senior execs for bottom-up and top-down coverage.
- Aligned to progress an AI Circle event with NVIDIA customers to facilitate neutral, multi-party introductions.

## Decisions (architecture, resourcing, priority)
- Reframe outreach to focus on concrete pipeline components (Kafka for RL, real-time vector DB) rather than platform narratives; improves resonance and response likelihood.
- Pursue NVIDIA-customer event (via AI Circle) as the primary NVIDIA intro mechanism; 1:1 direct intros from NVIDIA reps are unlikely.
- Broaden persona targeting to include data/pipeline owners, not just CTO-level contacts; increases entry points and reverses if exec paths re-open.
- Defer direct Google/Microsoft-introduced paths where conflicts exist; reduces risk of hyperscaler conflicts undermining intros.

## Risks (schedule, technical, external deps)
- Warm-intro threads cooling or stalling (e.g., Zara thread), reducing momentum.
- Reliance on weak LinkedIn mutuals yields low-quality intros and wasted cycles.
- Hyperscaler conflicts (Microsoft/Google) limit willingness to introduce or participate.
- Some targets may be locked into incumbent clouds or vendors (Oracle/Google), limiting immediate opportunity.
- Over-indexing on execs risks missing functional owners who can sponsor bottom-up pilots.

## Open Questions
- What is the definitive target list beyond the assigned 15; which net-new labs (e.g., Black Forest Labs) should be prioritized?
- Who owns ongoing BD coverage for SSI and what is the best initial contact beyond Daniel Levy?
- Will NVIDIA (via Katie/David Klein) support customer intros only through events, or are selective 1:1s possible?
- Are Apple contacts in iCloud/GPFS adjacent enough to reach the relevant AI infra decision-makers?
- Do we have better internal paths into Crusoe if that becomes relevant for any target’s infra decisions?

[00:00:00.01]   RemoteI'm doing well, man. Pleasure to meet you. I've been seeing you on Slack some, but haven't met you personally, so thanks for joining.

[00:00:07.96]  Jason ValleryYeah, awesome. Yeah, but just I guess this is week three. Still learning the ropes and meeting folks. What's your role?

[00:00:18.28]   RemoteYeah, so I was brought on board to focus on the model building. and particular kind of the ecosystem around the NEOs, and so I've come from AI21 Labs and I've been doing machine learning and data science and AI sales for about the last 10 years, and so that's kind of my background. I bring kind of the top down to the stack approach here, and so I'm learning about all good things around training. and inference and agentic workflows and bringing my experience from there to the infrastructure world. So that's me.

[00:00:54.17]  Jason ValleryYeah, I'm joining from Microsoft. I spent the last 13 years in Azure Storage, focusing on their object storage platform and have a lot of experience working with model builders on Azure, specifically, obviously, OpenAI, and I own the storage relationship with them.

[00:01:07.51]   RemoteAwesome. Good to meet ya. Happy Friday, guys. - Happy Friday. What's up, Chris? Sorry I'm late. All right, we got a small little crew here. This is a first for Jason too. I was just talking to Jeff, so I was able to get him in here. He may not be wearing any clothes though, so he's here. (laughing) - Please keep your camera off, Jeff. I literally just talked to Eric while I was in the shower. Jeff is a model of efficiency. Okay, I don't know, Ryan and I think he's in Korea. He told me he would not make it for obvious reasons there, right? I sent Jay a note to see if we can get him on here. We're going to accept him and see if he comes along. Jeff's done this before. Jason, this is for you, and Chris and I already spoke. Chris has some pretty interesting customers. We're going to talk about a few of them. This is brute force networking on LinkedIn, poking around to see who we know or who we're connected to, to try and get him warm introduction paths so that he can go meet these people and go sell more faster. You have an interesting network, Jason. That's why I think we invited you. So if there's people that you know... accounts that Chris wants to talk to, and you're like, "Hey, I know Steve because either I worked with him or he's married to my wife's sister. Let's go ask Steve for a meeting." That's basically the idea. So any questions? We have an hour booked. We could do this maybe in 20 minutes.

[00:02:32.62]  Jason ValleryExactly. I think we could do it in less time for sure. You know, like go spelunking through our shared LinkedIns.

[00:02:37.54]   RemoteWhat are we going to do here? Exactly what this is. Yeah. It's like, this is super basic and primitive, but it's actually, it's an interesting exercise and we'll see if we come up with anything, and the reality is like, nobody takes the time to do this when we don't force people to sit around a table like little children and like go poke around. So that's what we're going to do. All right. Um, all right. So Chris, who do you want to start with? And I'll have you share your screen if you want to. I will. Yeah. So. Per our last conversation, we took the sheet that I was working off of, which has all the different accounts, and I've got the names of people that I've triangulated through my own research and speaking to neoclouds and other people that are actually the buyers and relevant folks. So if we were to do kind of a-- review of all the ones in red obviously is where we're stuck we've got some progress and others and i'm sharing notes about where we are so we could go through each of the accounts and sort of look at the people and have a quick you know search that's how i was thinking it'd be a good way to structure this so we could just go boom boom boom systematically and knock this out quickly to see where to go and i can share bram if you guys have ideas for me uh things i haven't thought of please tell me and I will do it and that's kind of the you know impetus that you know prompted this meeting. Let's do it. Let's start with one and then if we find other interesting people that aren't on your list, I would just say like Jason and Jeff knows this, just jam the hyperlink of the person that's interesting into the chat. Chris can grab it, put it in his sheet and then he'll come back to you later and say, "Hey Jason, that guy you said you'd..." You know, who knew a person, you know, did you reach out and did you hear back? What's the action item? Yeah, exactly.

[00:04:13.16]  Jason ValleryYep.

[00:04:14.03]   RemoteAll right. Super, and I can share the sheet with you guys too, if you want, but it's just the way I'm keeping track of things internally. You'll see that there's listed investors there. I've had, you know, Amy and Renan working on some different angles there as well. So we can take it right from the top if that's okay. any other questions or comments? No, Jeff, any thoughts? No. Okay, super. So going from the top, the main guy that I was talking to, you know, with regards to compute and AI/Infra and, you know, is this guy Mile Ott from, you know, thinking... machines. So, if there's a way we can get, you know, find him. Have you talked to Glenn Lockwood?

[00:04:58.21]  Jason ValleryYeah, I was going to say, we have a friend over there, Glenn Lockwood from Mutual.

[00:05:02.80]   RemoteYeah, I did speak to Glenn, you know, and he mentioned that he had an engineer, you know, friend there that, you know, he had spoken to previously and kind of gave some context and background. Like, I have his Google Doc of his summary of of his meeting with him, but he did not seem to be a person that was gonna grant us an introduction. Now we can go back and go ahead and ask him if we can get an intro to Mile. That's one obvious good option. When I asked him last time, he's like, "It didn't seem like that was something we could do yet." But I'll certainly follow up with him to see if he can intro him directly.

[00:05:37.77]  Jason ValleryAnd I put it in the chat, there's a guy over there named Christian Gibson that we worked a lot with at OpenAI who left for thinking machine labs. I would say Glenn has a better relationship with Christian than I do, I've met him a handful of times, so I would certainly lean on Glenn for guidance on what's appropriate to reach out to Christian about, but I put Christian's LinkedIn in the chat.

[00:05:57.48]   RemoteCool. Sounds good, man. I appreciate it. I will take that down. But yes, I think that would be the main person. If we can get to the CTO, great. But like I heard the guy that is handling all of these decisions, especially talking to Corweave and other people, is this guy a mile hot? Chris, sorry, I'll just jump in real quick. Lior Ballon. Ballon, maybe you know him. He's a Rene Eye guy. connected to Mile? Do we know him well enough to ask for an intro? He's at NVIDIA, of course. John Malmesen. But I think you're playing the wrong game, and what I mean here is that calling the guy that runs the purchasing contracts at these clouds doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to care at all about what we're doing. So not the purchasing contacts, the person who's in charge of like, you know, compute in an AI infrastructure. That's what I meant, Jeff. I didn't mean that the procurement people. - Okay, well, a lot of times those guys are managing contracts. They're not like necessarily thinking about the user. - Yeah, this guy, Seth, like a ML, AI, infra guy, in particular, yeah. He does seem like the right person. persona that we would want to speak to, outside of the executive team, obviously, but it seemed like you'd be a relevant target to understand kind of what we're doing from a data pipeline perspective. Jeff, if you look at his LinkedIn pedigree, he was a founding researcher, a character, a distinguished research scientist, a deep mind. I see. I see it. Listen, we don't need to do this for everybody. I have a dinner with the head of sales at Corweave in a few weeks, and I can put this on the table. Everybody else, it's not really that interesting in terms of my network. Okay, cool. So, should we move on to the next one? I would just see, so I know Alon came in late. Alon, I don't know if you've done one of these before. We're just trying to find Chris Patz into something. of these accounts. Chris, give me one second. I'm just looking to see it. I don't think this is a good use of Elan's time. To be honest, I think he's not as networked as we all are and he's got really big things to work on. If that's true, then Elan, go away. Thank you. Have a good Friday. By the way, if he knows Lior Belanglo, you said John-- - I just told you to use John Mel. - I got it, it's in the chat, okay. All right, I don't see any other connections on my side, and again, I'm probably not the most connected here anyway, but-- - I have 10, I'm telling you. I'll also talk to the guy from Florida. - Yeah, no next. Actually, do you remember An Kang, Jeff, is he still willing to go to help us? Yeah, he's an investor, but I'm not sure how connected he is. He's got at least two people over that he's connected with. But you need to phrase it in terms of what they get. Like, what problem are we trying to solve first? Yeah, of course. - We didn't talk about the message, we're just talking about the people. - Okay, should we move on or do we have that one covered so far?

[00:09:18.64]  Jason Vallery- I don't think anyone else in my network that has a thinking machine labs.

[00:09:23.19]   RemoteOkay, cool. The next one would be, you know, reflection. So we did get an introduction to Misha through, you know, one of our investors, I think it was NEA, and that was, or at least an investor that was thinking about us. Anyway, we responded, Misha didn't reply, but I did Giannis is the person that is talking to Nebbias and Together and the other NeoClouds, and it's definitely a relevant discussion for about 10,000 GB 300s right now for the run they want to do. So if there's any way we can get to Giannis, that's someone we have not been introduced to, and he is, I think, more relevant from a, you know, compute and infrastructure perspective.

[00:10:07.78]  Jason ValleryAnd I guess, Jason, that didn't come through for me, I don't know his name and I was doing it out because I'm looking him up. What's that's a different, sorry, trying to find it, but if you have linked in of the specific people, you're trying to connect. it might be helpful if you put them in the chat or send the link so I can kind of like figure out the piece of separation, you know, the Kevin Bacon distance.

[00:10:36.34]   RemoteAll right. So Robert from Lambda knows him. Have you gotten in touch with Robert yet? So I've been introduced to Robert and responded to an email with Robert, but no, I have not been able to meet. him. He was non-responsive when I reached out. But I didn't have you or anyone else introduce me. It was just, you know, that Jay or just John and I and the thread. So I have not met with him yet.

[00:11:05.89]  Jason ValleryI have a mutual with him, but I don't really know this guy. I don't even know why I'm mutual. He's an SRE guy. Frederico balance. Why do I know this guy? I'll tell you a lot of the people on my LinkedIn are just they went and followed me because I did something at Microsoft at a presentation some point I just accepted it. That I don't actually can say that I actually know he is I'm connected to and he's connected to this Janus guy. I don't think that's a good enough. strong enough link to make it play.

[00:11:40.02]   Remote- Okay. - In general, I'm not okay with you not having met this guy. - Yeah. - And I'm gonna ask Jay to help just have a sit down. - That would be great, Jeff, and it's not the first time we've discussed this. him myself and have not been able to do so but I have met you know Tom and I've met a lot of people at CoreWeave and I've been you know doing the networking that we did reviewed but but Lambda has one that has not materialized so far. So any assistance you can provide would be great. Thanks. Happy to follow up on that one. It would be great. So, should we keep moving then? It doesn't sound like there's a hit on Giannis right now, which is fine. Yeah, yeah. No worries. We'll keep going. I'm liking you a little bit. I'm poking around. The hit on Giannis is Robert Brooks. Oh, OK. So he can be the guy that does that, right? OK. So we'll go to the next one. So we requested an introduction to Lockheed Room through one of our investors. He declined. Go ahead.

[00:13:07.73]  Jason VallerySo we can see column one, because I don't know what company we're talking about right now.

[00:13:10.85]   RemoteOh, I'm sorry. Yeah, physical intelligence. Hey, sorry, just one sec. Same dude on Kong and showing up on a lot. I don't know if this guy's for real with those connections, but he's the investor I mentioned on Thinking Machines. Connected to some folks there. He knows a bunch of folks at Reflection too, including the CEO. I don't know how real, but we should check with him. I'll make sure I introduce you to him after this. - And which investment firm is he with, Ankan? - He's got his own little jam. What is the company's, hold on, I'll tell you. One Prime Capital, he's a principal there. - Nobody. - Okay, got it. I might I might be with the CEO of physical intelligence today. Okay, that's helpful. All right, let me see.

[00:14:02.66]  Jason ValleryChris, maybe hide columns B through F or something just so we can kind of see the names you're looking for and the company name at the same time, just the way it's projected.

[00:14:12.15]   RemoteWait, wait, wait, Bond is an investor in physical intelligence. Yes. Did you reach out to Bond? We did, and when we did that, I think that Lockhe declined to meet, even though we had the introduction from them. All right, well, I'm going to try to get a meeting with the other guy. Yeah, no, no, the guy that I'm, as I said, Yuri is the guy that I want to go after now. Go have Bond work on that one. Okay. (typing) What shade of work? Okay. Okay. Cool, and we already met with, you know, ESO and Pierre Eves. So I'm kind of working that angle with Corweave and also with them directly now that we've had an introduction. So I think we can go past that. Scroll back left. I'm with Jason. You got to let us see who you're talking about. We don't know the people. Hide the stuff in the middle if we're not going to cover that just so we can see A next to people.

[00:15:22.77]  Jason ValleryI'm a hundred percent alive with Jason and I can't follow you exactly. I want to work ahead a little bit, too Can you hide the columns Chris? Oh, yeah. Sorry. Hold on a second here I see two Jeff Edwards. One is enough. One is enough.

[00:15:55.17]   RemoteOkay, I think I've got it better. Sorry about that.

[00:16:06.22]  Jason ValleryYou're not sharing anything.

[00:16:09.72]   RemoteTalk. We'll let you know. Yeah I've tried I was just trying to fix it myself before I share it again. Okay so is that better? That'll work great. Yes for sure. Yeah sorry sorry about that guys, I made a confusion. You're good, you're good, you're good, you're good. You good at pull side? I think you said you're good there? Yes I think we're okay for now on that one. Majority. I can't find it, why can't I find it?

[00:16:51.50]  Jason ValleryI found him, I'm not connected.

[00:16:54.50]   RemoteWhat the fuck he's hiring i can't even keep it to lincoln yeah one sec i got it i'm mentally challenged here today okay have we ever met them jeff journey? I don't know. Did you check Salesforce? I haven't, but I can. We'll see. Did you do Do any of that, Chris, go kind of through the archives of Salesforce to see if there's there's not a lot of activity um you know just a bunch of unopened emails yep uh yeah no prior opportunities Oh, you know who might be able to help with locking? Bill Nail is connected with their founder and CTO. >> No, don't use Bill, and why not? You think he's just full of shit? Yeah. Security. I'm shit clear. How do you spell Schickler? S-C-H-I-C-K-L-E-R. Thank you. I have three connections. You know, the one that knows all these guys is Robert Nishihara from any scale. Yeah. Yeah. Outside of that, I don't know anybody that knows him. Colette from. we've knows him. Rob Benga is connected to their founder in CTL. So he's an easy check. Let me ask him if he knows this person. This is a Weka customer I think. Which one Jeff? The journey. The journey is? Interesting.

[00:19:54.50]  Jason ValleryWe have a bunch of mutuals with MidJourney's founder, David Hulse. A lot of Microsoft folks seem to know him.

[00:19:59.73]   Remote- I mean, that would be an interesting one, probably better than, you know, Sam anyway, if we can get him.

[00:20:06.49]  Jason Vallery- Let me see.

[00:20:07.69]   Remote- He should. - Andrew Park is connected to their general counsel.

[00:20:15.35]  Jason ValleryThere's a guy I worked a lot with at Microsoft, who's now at Google, who knows a bunch of these guys, but it's a little bit dicey to go to a Google guy and ask for an intro.

[00:20:32.07]   RemoteThey're doing all their computing and a lot of it was in Google originally. They're thinking about doing something on their own. That's what the NVIDIA, you know, rep told me outside of there. So, but if you, I mean, I'll take any, anyway, we have no way into Majority at this point, and they're self-funded and have no, like, investor bootstrap. Let me take an action.

[00:20:52.94]  Jason ValleryI'm going to reach out to, there's a guy I know, he's now at Google, Henry Perez, and I'll kind of soft reach out. out to him and see if I can develop something going and if he wants to enter in some of his contacts. But let me just get a sense on what he's doing at Google

[00:21:08.11]   RemoteAnd if that's a friendly or not. Awesome. Thanks, Jason. Okay, should we keep moving? I think so. Okay, super. So, the next one would be SSI, and I know we had a previous meeting there, I think Alon had had, you know, we wanted to go after this guy, you know, Daniel Levy, who's kind of like a co-founder, but also was promoted to president, and is like in charge of infrared compute there. find um Daniel Levy would be you know probably the right persona. I'm gonna guess that's a really common name. Do we have a LinkedIn link? Yeah one sec. You know Alon knows him right? Um I believe so um but I had pinged him after the last time I met with Renan to talk about this, and, um, you know, he had sent one email outreach and hadn't gotten a reply, and, you know, I suggested I could ghostwrite something else, and I think it sat there. I'm not sure if he -- what we did after that, but -- >> So, Lone also met with some other guys there. You should just grab Lone for two minutes and just ask him for a smell. >> Okay. I'll ping him again. I didn't know he met with anyone else, but I think -- Daniel's our guy for. - So there's, in these situations, there's never just one guy, right? So let's stop talking like that. - Yeah, so I'm trying to get to the, you know, person who has enough authority, Jeff, that, you know. - It doesn't matter. You can slice these up six ways to Sunday. You find somebody that really cares about storage, you could have a totally different, whatever. You find somebody that used to ask that. another lab, then you can have a different situation. Sure. So here's what

[00:22:58.26]  Jason ValleryI can say about this guy. He had a stint at OpenAI, so he must have been somebody that, whatever her name is, Maria Moratti took over with her, because I've got like six different OpenAI guys as mutuals, so I don't know how we want to play that. For example, you know, I've talked a lot about Rory, Jeff, like Rory's connected to him. I don't know if we go to OpenAI and say, "Hey, can you introduce us to..."

[00:23:24.41]   RemoteThey definitely will not. They hate each other. Yeah.

[00:23:27.41]  Jason ValleryDo you not know who this is? This is Ilya's company. Right. So, I've got one person that's not an OpenAI guy connected, and he's a Microsoft guy, but he's kind of like a BD guy at Microsoft. I don't know how well he will know this guy.

[00:23:40.00]   Remote- I got another, not really in this. - Okay. So I'll ping Elon again to see who else he might've met with there. But Rick, this is really why we need. doing BD on this whole space because all of the cloud sales VPs talk about SSI all the time yeah all right topic for next for on Tuesday right okay But you know, it's it's a it's

[00:24:45.63]  Jason ValleryAnd there's anyone didn't they sign like a billion dollar deal with google to take this project over

[00:24:51.36]   RemoteMulti-billion well so i mean obviously yes i saw the deal about siri uh for gemini and but i mean there's there's other um you know things that they're doing besides that right so they have i don't think the efforts have completely evaporated um but you know, yes, I saw, you know, that, you know, they inked the deal with Google for a Siri project.

[00:25:14.24]  Jason VallerySo the guy who runs Crusoe's engineering team knows her. So I know the engineering manager at Crusoe, Nadav, he's connected to her. I don't know if that's a path we'd want to go to. That means they're looking at Crusoe for infrastructure.

[00:25:36.65]   RemoteYeah, it could very well be. They talked to them all.

[00:25:52.96]  Jason Valleryto try that with Jason and see what he says like well who's running like I'm probably not the one to introduce you to crew so we probably have better internal

[00:25:59.75]   RemoteWarm context if we want to go that path yeah David on my team is you know leading that if there's a persona that particularly your I guess let me know who the guy is and I can ask David to get

[00:26:17.60]  Jason Valleryan intro there to talk about. This is my mutual. I met him once. I mean, frankly, I interviewed with him once. Nadav. I just went off that. Let me go back.

[00:26:44.78]   Remotehe knows her though okay sounds good well we'll keep moving then um and if there's no other uh mutuals or any other one uh for for apple right now okay super so per perplexity um So the only thing I'll say about Apple is I think they just I think the IBM team is getting their GPFS team which as I understand Apple AI is built on. There's got to be somebody we can talk to.

[00:27:13.51]  Jason ValleryI will say I have other contacts at Apple but frankly they're all iCloud people for a different reason but I don't know how that would overlap.

[00:27:22.98]   RemoteOK, let's see if there's any I'll take a contact from anywhere basically, but I think that it definitely would need to be someone connected back to her who knows them. Should we keep moving and go to perplexity? Yeah. Okay. So, uh, Tony Wu and Kevin Hu, um, it would be the right folks. My buddy Aang from Hong Kong is all over this place again. Thank you very much. That doesn't matter. Yeah, yeah. Whether he remembers or not, if we have a direct connection, they should try and flex it. Just another, it's another signal, right? Did he agree to reach out or no? No, I can, I can ask him to do that anyway, even though it's cold, but yes, I can ask him to do that. Ian also said that he... I had some connect via being from the same place that their CEO is from. So I'm not sure where he sits with that, but I can ping him as well. That was part of our last conversation. Sure. Do you know Grant Lee, Chris? No, I don't know who that is. in the pipelines team. Ryan McGinty, he's in the New York area. Oh, he's on the East Coast. Yes, I do. I know the name. I don't know who he is, but yes. He's connected to a guy, Noah Yonick, data science at Perplexity. It might be an interesting one to check in on. I'll put it

[00:29:53.54]  Jason Valleryin the chat here. You know, our cart is connected to Kevin Wu. We just talked about that one, I think you missed it. Oh, sorry. Boston. It's okay.

[00:30:18.29]   RemoteYou were poking around. We covered that one though, Jason.

[00:30:20.27]  Jason ValleryAll right.

[00:30:21.08]   RemoteRory Keller worthy enough, also connected to Noah Yonick. Rory seems to connect with the right people. So let's try Grant first. Rory doesn't have a lot of experience. I'm going to go with Grant. Rory doesn't have a lot of experience. So I'm going to go with Grant. So I'm going to go with Grant. I'm going to go with Grant. always make connections and Vidya tries to stay neutral. He runs a life sciences team. Where's Katie in all of this, Chris? Are they making any intros for you? They have not. You know, I've certainly spoken to now individual reps and I met with Katie. You know, the one introduction I requested was to Janice and, or to Misha at Reflection. was too early to make that introduction, but I've been trying to work the NVIDIA, you know, reps directly, and I've gotten a lot of intel. Some of the intel that is here has come from them, about who the people that they're interacting with and so forth, but I have not gotten any warm introductions via NVIDIA yet. I don't think that's how it's going to work. I think we need to a few events where we get their customers in a room, we do some social and educational stuff. Lindsay talked with her about this. Actually, it was Katie's idea, but we need to kind of move forward. Yeah, so I'm trying to put together an event with AI Circle. right now to bring model builders, NEOs and us together and I think that could be an avenue to explore Jeff where we have something educational and social so we can certainly try to coordinate something around that. I was thinking along the same lines. you know okay so i'll keep moving uh from perplexity we'll exclude one other sorry uh jeff hillock is connected to some business guy his title is business fellow at perplexity it looks to be an investor vc guy i don't know if that's the right path in and i don't know if hillock would make that connection he's in the past he's tried you think that's worth pursuing? I don't know who Hillock is. He's the Dell Venture guy. He worked with Darling, I think, on his team. Oh, Chris Hillock. Yeah, sorry. Um, sure. Okay, I'll take that one. I'll put in the check, Chris. Okay Got it, so Keep on moving guys Yeah, okay, so we got an agreement to Zara Jeff and I did through our for our investors to Jeff Yonker and Bo Wang. This guy's like head of AI research and Jeff is the, I think, president, that's his title. They did not respond back to my response to pinging the thread to schedule, and when Jeff followed up in the same thread, I think it was last week prior to UTC, we did not get a response either. So, that's currently sitting, you know, lukewarm at this point, maybe running cold, but what I was told when I spoke to NVIDIA was that, and CoreWeave, that Justin Yan and He2 were people that, you know, they were talking to. So, I'll take any introduction we can get, you know, but those are the folks that we Jeff, I don't know if you think it's wise to ping that same thread again, you know.

[00:33:51.83]  Jason Vallery- I've got a mutual with Patu. So Jeff Nitti's engineering manager counterpart, I don't know if you've ever met him, his name's Raghu. He is a mutual with their CTO. I know Raghu very well, I don't know if that. That's it. Our door, we should open. Thoughts on if we should go and ask Raghu for an intro?

[00:34:23.90]   RemoteWhatever. I don't know.

[00:34:25.70]  Jason ValleryOK.

[00:34:26.20]   RemoteI don't think Microsoft's going to give us a lot of these introductions. they're struggling to get to these accounts too.

[00:34:33.19]  Jason Vallery- Yeah, but Ragu is an engineering man. He's not a business developer.

[00:34:36.93]   Remote- The question is, is he your friend and will he do you a favor? Or are you just bothering a guy 'cause you know him?

[00:34:43.21]  Jason ValleryThat answer is yes. - We were friendly, we're friendly for sure, and he'd do me a favor, but I don't know if he wants to do it against Microsoft's best interests.

[00:34:53.17]   RemoteRory knows head to Jeff. I can ask him for a solid and see if he can help it out Fred love knows their head of finance Jeff. Come on. Let's just keep going, please. Okay So Cohere, I'm having a meeting with the CoreWeave team on Monday. Jeff, I followed up, I know they're building the data center in Canada, obviously, per our last conversation in this same thread. The people who want to get to, you know, in light of their CTO leaving and then Martin stepping down, who was part of the original thread we were following up on before. it would be like this guy Phil who's taking over the CTO position and he's based in the UK and he was very active in speaking a lot of conferences about what they're doing from a training and infrastructure perspective as Autumn Mulder. So trying to get them to do this event with us through AI Circle, the guy there Albert has some good you know connections into Cohere. But those are some of the folks that we're trying to get to. I'd go here.

[00:36:05.06]  Jason ValleryI've got a couple with Bill. One of them is an engineer over at CoreWeave, and then I've got another guy at Microsoft that knows him. So I can ping both of those and ask for a mature to fill.

[00:36:16.17]   RemoteOK. I see a shitload of people connected to a shitload of people, but I'm trying to see that's interesting. Oh, you keep going, I'll... Okay. - Yeah, I'll come back to you. - So, you know, Eric is the CEO of Magic. You know, we're pending an introduction via Amy. Now, one thing that was interesting here, one of our investors, you know, was also an investor there, or at least we knew someone, and so that's kind of what I'm doing there, anything back. If there's any connect back to Eric that would be excellent.

[00:37:30.66]  Jason VallerySo, this guy that I mentioned at CoreWeave, his name is Aaron Batillo, he and I worked together quite a bit at Microsoft and he just left Microsoft for CoreWeave. He's also connected to Eric, so it feels like I need to go talk to him.

[00:37:59.18]   RemoteOkay, yeah, that's great. Thanks, Jason.

[00:38:05.53]  Jason ValleryOkay, I'm going to say, I don't know, I have one other contact that I could potentially reach out but I don't know that she's gonna be useful. She was actually an intern on my team for a while. She's at NVIDIA though now, I think. I'll check in with her.

[00:38:28.87]   RemoteThat's to the NVIDIA team told me to reach out to. That's who they're dealing with. Okay, cool. I'll keep moving. I'm going to skip meta, you know, and, you know, we want anthropic, you know, we met I met with Tom and John, you know, yesterday at the actually on Wednesday. They have some x strike contacts that they're reaching out to that. a lot of folks went over to Anthropic so I'm trying to work that angle we were denied by Daniela with Amy's initial outreach you know I know that in scale met James Jeff you probably already heard that from Tom I'm guessing but you're trying to get to Rahul and and or Sam when they uh said that was the right timing for them uh when that's not the guy that's not the guy i have i have james yeah i i know we talked about james before um sorry okay yeah yeah so definitely he would still i can add him to this list he's not someone i've forgotten about um but i think that uh he will now report uh to Rahul who was brought on as the CTO and you know Sam being the head of model training you know I was just trying to get their intro to the highest person we could but obviously if we can get to James that's great he was kind of a hard guy to reach so I'll take any introduction we can but even the CFO kind of stalled our you know initial meeting when he said he would meet. So trying to find the right way into anthropic still You guys have any suggestions, please. Let me know

[00:40:14.15]  Jason ValleryI mean the first thing I'll point out is he has a shit ton of LinkedIn connections I mean, I I've got 30 something mutuals with him, which doesn't necessarily imply that they're all good mutuals In terms of quality and ability to access him So it might be a little I mean, there's people in here I'd be willing to poke, but it's not clear that they would be great pats in.

[00:40:41.63]   RemoteI understand.

[00:40:53.22]  Jason ValleryThe same Nadav from Crusoe's first connection with him. that or you could talk to or no. He's clearly talking to Microsoft. He's got a bunch of Nitty's team, which we know, right?

[00:41:38.64]   RemoteBye. Bye. Bye.

[00:42:00.78]  Jason ValleryYeah, I mean what I would say is I've got Oracle people and Microsoft people primarily and the Microsoft people would be the ones that are probably driving the anthropic relationship. So yeah, those all feel like we should keep those off limits.

[00:42:23.27]   RemoteI'll come. I have no context. We do. Anthropic. Yeah, we had another investor. Like I said, Jeff, we wrote that paragraph. We're trying to get the, you know, team to, you know, haven't heard any feedback from me either. I had multiple investors trying to get us in there.

[00:42:46.25]  Jason VallerySo, let me see what I have inside here.

[00:43:18.70]   RemoteChris, I've fallen behind, I'm gonna, okay. up with um either Rory or one of his reps who's selling to Zyra. They've got a path to he too he knows the CEO but he said he's a academic and scientist and not really an introduction he thinks he can make it but uh a CEO mark the CEO mark you mean uh the CEO who's the C I don't see He too is the right guy. He's like ex-meta and you know. Do you know David Klein? He's the NVIDIA rep that might get you in. Okay. No, I did not know David. Yeah. If we could get to him, uh, could that, that could come through Rory. Is that what you're trying to say? Yeah. Rory will introduce us to his guy, David. Hopefully David can take you to he too or had to. Thanks man. Rory, the life sciences Rory? Yeah, xyro-therapeutics. Yeah, yeah, model developer. Yeah, but if they're all in Oracle, then what are we doing? I don't know, Jeff, if it's going to be, you know, eternally only in Oracle, that would be a hard starting point. But I mean, you know, they could certainly be talking to Neo clouds or other places as well. So I just wanted to feel them out, you know, and see where they are. Why are we doing things like calling on the vector database teams and talking to them about something that's more scalable? Why aren't we talking to the data pipeline teams about like the stuff that pulls talked about? I certainly would, you know, talk to them about that from an RL, you know, perspective for post-training. That would be one of the things I would mention, the AIOS. You know, absolutely, that's what I was talking to people at Rage Summit about and that resonated a lot. But my point is, this whole exercise is, let's go find the most senior person in the company and send them a note and just hope for a purchase order, and I think we've been we've been at this and it's not really it's it's it's a it's super tough Yeah, I agree. It's tough in some cases. It's not necessarily the CTO that we're talking to there are other people that you know, I Heard from like NVIDIA and you know The other people that are you know, Neos that are telling me that they're that's the people they're talking talking to that are involved with, you know, technical and, you know, compute decisions. So they're the ones that, you know, saying when we talk about storage, we're talking to these people. So I'm just trying to start somewhere, uh, to someone that has, you know, relevance and understanding and could see value in our product. So if there's certainly other people, uh, absolutely. I'm game to meet anybody, uh, the way. what find a way in. It could be bottom up, top down, doesn't matter to me. Okay, well then my point is that there's a whole data team that sits alongside this that we're not even having any discussions about.

[00:46:18.64]  Jason ValleryThis list also seems, maybe you can give clarity on like, is this the full set of model builders we're going after? Because I can think of some that aren't on this list. How did you get to this set of 15?

[00:46:34.22]   RemoteThese are the accounts that I was assigned. So certainly, there are other newer labs that are forming. Like, I met one or two this past week at Ray Summit. But if there's others you mentioned that aren't here, Jason, let me know.

[00:46:50.34]  Jason ValleryYeah. I was thinking about-- There's one I do, are you familiar with Black Forest Labs? Uh no, no. They're an image gen model. I might meet somebody and see what they're up to. I'll just make it up for myself.

[00:47:09.33]   RemoteAgain, sounds awesome. I don't know that anyone's chasing. at vast Black Forest Labs. I will raise my hand to do that today.

[00:47:21.20]  Jason Vallery- I assume we have like a full list. Is there, I mean, I can go spelunk into Salesforce just as well as anyone, but I'm just, do we have a broader list of targets?

[00:47:30.36]   Remote- Yeah, these are the targets. I'm working again with Jay. We can certainly add, you know, additional ones. Yeah, this is kind of what, you know, my focus area has been on, and I'm certainly happy to look at any and all model builders, and especially if there's no active opportunity or no one's calling them, like, put me in the game. I'm ready to go, coach. So that's what I have to say. I'm looking for a pipeline and finding whatever way I can sell best, so. So absolutely, Jason, I'm open to if you know another lab that I've never heard of, like, please let me know, man, I'm happy to follow up.

[00:48:23.36]  Jason Valleryis like, are we approaching the VC angle? Like, are we connected to like--

[00:48:30.14]   Remote- Part of the initial matrix that was created here in those different columns that I hid were who's invested in Vast and who's invested in the company, and so, and who is in overlap. and who do we know if there's no overlap, and so part of what I've been doing with Amy and Rennan is reaching out to those people as well, and I did get a few hits. There's some we haven't tried, but there's obviously more red here than I would like to see, and I would like to change that. So we're trying to do whatever whatever's necessary. Data teams exist. Executives, mid-level people, directors, ex-VAST, core people, anyone we can find. Just trying to start somewhere and tracking this and trying to make progress. I've been at this 60 days and I'm working as hard as I can. I want to win for VAST. So you guys have ideas, suggestions, point me in the right direction. go start talking to the data teams. I wrote that down. I've got it, Jeff. Thank you. Okay. All right, Chris. I think you're on the right path to a lot of these things, and work with the pipelines team to create some point of notes. Like, hey, we built the world's most scalable Kafka system for reinforcement learning. That's the email. Not like, here's an AI operating system. Nobody buys that. Yep, that would not be how it would reach out just generally, but yeah, here's uh, we built the world's first real-time vector database for You know both data prep and for rag Uh, you know 100 times more scalable not expensive comes from a new systems architecture. Can we talk? We got a lot of good leads and threads to go pull on. I signed myself up for a little bit of homework here. Chris, hopefully you've got some. That's the whole purpose of this, right, is to try and drum up additional paths and also have some philosophical conversations around how to approach some of these folks. I hope it was a good use of time. We'll find it out as you chase people down to see who can ultimately help you. Yeah, Jason. Yeah, thank you guys very much for your time. I realize you have a lot on your plate, many things to do, but we're extremely grateful for your support and suggestions. So much appreciated, man. You guys have a wonderful weekend. You too. This is Brute Force ugly LinkedIn poking around. This is not meant to be a fun hour. But I think you got some good stuff here, man. We're wrapping it up anyway we can, and if you think of other ideas or other people who are like, you find it, you know, right? I know, I know. So you just go reach out, and I'll say this now that Jeff dropped, like, you know, Jeff's a tough cookie. Don't worry about it.

[00:51:14.34]  Jason ValleryYes.

[00:51:14.98]   RemoteBut he does have good ideas. At this point, like, I'm just trying to be open to whatever method it is. I don't care who it is, where it is. Like, I'm looking under rocks, you know, like, whatever. - That's the right approach, that's the right approach. Keep doing it, you'll find the path. - Yeah, so that's the ultimate. But honestly, like, I'm pretty interested to learn more about Black Forest. I'm gonna do some research on that, Jason.

[00:51:40.61]  Jason Vallery- I know the founder, I know the founder, they're actually, they partnered with X-Men, and I think some of their guys are doing image gen for Grok, but they're an independent lab out of Germany, and I worked quite a bit with them in the past. So I'll ping them. Yeah. I mean, my general take is you've got to stay with the VCs and figure out who's getting funding and be at the front end of when these guys are paying.

[00:52:03.09]   RemoteExactly. That's why I started with in this sheet, who has the most money and the accounts. list you see are people who have $500 million, a billion, or $2 billion or above. That's basically my list. Or who, for example, Mid Journey, who's bootstrapped and has massive amounts of revenue with a very small team. Obviously, that's the first angle I took. Who has money? Where are they currently in the cloud? like or where is their current infrastructure, and what current NEOs and other partnerships. So I kind of tried to think about my decision making and filtering who to go after, and I ruled out a lot of companies like Inflection, for example, who was definitely a contender in the early days, but then got swallowed up by Microsoft, and then there's acquirers like Adapt at Amazon and Character at Google and things like that. So I tried to narrow this down to a list that seem like potential, you know, buyer. I'm sorry. I totally, if I can blow up another meeting, I'm going to see if I can catch the last four minutes. I'm going to make you the host, Chris. Black Forest is not in Salesforce, but Jeff is connected to people over there. We know, we know people. So go, go pull them up and see who you know, and if it's worth chasing, it may not be, don't get distracted. You've got a lot of really interesting places on your list that we need to go sell to. Yeah, and there's folks there that I think you were going to introduce me to, Eric. Is that right? OK, whatever.

[00:53:20.30]  Jason ValleryAnyway, I'm about to I got to go get ready for my next meeting. But yeah, I'll let you know if you find anything in my LinkedIn, like just ping me and I'm happy to try and figure things out. So feel free to stalk whoever I know. Cool. OK, thanks, great. We appreciate it.

[00:54:00.96]   RemoteWe're going to have a couple more days, we've got to be ready to go in, I've got meetings for the next hour and a half.

[00:54:23.73]  Jason ValleryINAUDIBLE

[00:55:08.82]   RemoteBye-bye. (silence) I don't know if that's a good way to put it, but I think it's important to recognize that there are a lot of things that we don't always realize that we can do, and I don't mean to sound like this is a bad thing, but I think it's important to recognize that we can do a lot of things that we don't always realize that we can do, and that's one of the things that I think is important to recognize. You (silence) I'm going to go ahead and close the call. Pause
