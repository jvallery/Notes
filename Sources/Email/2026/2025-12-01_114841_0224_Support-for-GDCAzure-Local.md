# Support for GDC/Azure Local- Exported: 2026-01-05 17:30:16- Messages: 1---## 2025-12-01 11:48:41 — Karl Vietmeier <karl.vietmeier@vastdata.com>**Subject:** Support for GDC/Azure Local> Jason,> We’re seeing growing interest in whether we support GCD and Azure Local. While these initially come to us as cloud opportunities, the on-prem teams tend to take ownership as soon as hardware is involved. This often creates confusion over accountability and can dilute our visibility into progress and outcomes.> I believe these opportunities should be managed through cloud product management. We have the strongest relationships with the hyperscalers and these solutions will ultimately be acquired through them and tied to cloud consumption. Ensuring cloud product management ownership would allow us to maintain control over execution and alignment with strategic cloud initiatives.> Looking for your guidance on how aggressive we should be in asserting ownership and how much control you want to maintain over these opportunities.> Thanks,>  >  >  >  >  > ￼> Karl Vietmeier> Cloud Solutions Architect - VAST on Cloud> > karlv@vastdata.com | +1 9497953118> in/https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlvietmeier/> vastdata.com | 33 North 1st Street, Suite C1 , Campbell, CA 95008>  > “It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the credit.”> John Wooden>  > ---
