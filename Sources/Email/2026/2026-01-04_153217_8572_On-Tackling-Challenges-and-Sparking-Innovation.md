**Subject:** On Tackling Challenges and Sparking Innovation

> All,
> For the past two weeks, a big part of our R&D team has been co-opted to build an auxiliary system, to recover nearly 200K files on Crusoe's cluster. At first this system was manual, then semi-automatic, and now we have successfully built a fully automatic machine to fix every last bit. 
> 
> At VAST, we love the challenge of building new things, conquering new ground, winning bigger and bigger deals. In this case we were tasked with a challenge not of building, but of repairing. What happened at Crusoe is analogous to a glass ball, shattering into millions of tiny pieces. We needed to recover every last piece and put that ball back together, as if nothing ever happened. It shows just how committed we are to never losing a single bit of customer data. I am extremely proud of the way our team stepped up to tackle this new type of challenge. To maintain our perfect record.
> 
> Throughout this adventure we had ups and downs. Between breakthroughs it felt like it couldn't be done. At times we accidentally shot ourselves in the foot and took two steps back. There was the night when we needed to send an Icelandic man into the data center at 2am, and for no apparent reason he stayed on the debug zoom with us until sunrise. Or the time when we packed a suitcase full of spare cables, and needed a volunteer to fly them in. After pulling several all-nighters to hit the customer's deadline, we all came out with a huge sigh of relief and feeling of satisfaction. Knowing that with this team, we truly can overcome anything that gets thrown at us.
> 
> With one crisis averted last week, this upcoming week I am going to Las Vegas, to help our Ops team secure NAND allocation at CES. Without noticing, VAST has quickly grown to account for more than 10% of the data center NAND market, which means we need to build strategic relationships with the major Flash vendors. Especially in this time of shortage.
> 
> Both of these cases made me notice the strengthened collaboration between our teams across the globe. As we hire more R&D people outside of Israel, and more G&A people in Israel, the bridge across the ocean is widening.
> 
> It brings joy to my heart to see our extended team merge into one, but more importantly, this bridge holds our secret to innovation.
> 
> It is said that new ideas form at the edge of chaos. Where cultures clash, where strangers meet. The paradox of keeping one foot in and one foot out, allows us to change the universe. While avoiding assimilation. While avoiding conformity. We must always maintain the ability to critically observe our surroundings from the outside looking in. Always staying outsiders. Never fully belonging. That's how we remain original and maintain our creativity. Poets and writers have tried to capture this concept. Leonard Cohen wrote "Show me slowly what I only know the limits of", and David Foster Wallace centered his famous commencement address "This is Water" around the idea that fish must breach the surface to understand what they are swimming in. Arthur C. Clarke said "The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible".
> 
> The limits are where interesting things happen. May we always be lucky enough to focus our exploration around points of discontinuity.
> 
> Always stay curious. Never stop innovating,
