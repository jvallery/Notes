By integrating the NVIDIA Cosmos Reason 2 VLM directly into the VAST AI OS, we’re enabling cities to move beyond "what happened?" to "why is it happening?" and "what should we do next?" in real-time.> How to amplify:> React: Give the corporate post an "Insightful" or "Love" reaction. > Repost: Use the "Repost" option without adding commentary to help keep the engagement focused on the main thread. > Comment: Share your perspective on the original post. Use the samples below for inspiration! > Sample Comments Based on Your Role> For Engineering & Technical Teams> The transition from batch analytics to a unified video intelligence engine is a major architectural shift. Using the VAST DataEngine to trigger Cosmos Reason 2 for 'System 2' thinking ensures we only run expensive AI workloads when they are actually needed. > I love the concept of the 'City Watch' pipeline. Moving from cron jobs to native event-driven triggers in the DataEngine makes these smart city workflows incredibly responsive and scalable. > For Sales & Business Development> This solves a massive problem for municipal leaders: false positives. By using Chain-of-Thought reasoning, the system can distinguish between a car stopping for a pedestrian and an actual traffic hazard before dispatching services. > This isn't just a safety tool; it's an efficiency tool. We’re showing cities how to scale their intelligence across thousands of cameras without needing a new infrastructure silo for every single agent. > For Channel & Partners (Ecosystem Focus)> Another powerful integration with the NVIDIA Metropolis Blueprint. Combining VAST DataStore with Cosmos Reason 2 NIM microservices creates a production-grade solution that is easy for partners to deploy and scale. > The VAST AI OS is proving to be the ideal substrate for NVIDIA's physical AI models. Together, we’re turning passive video into actionable, real-time intelligence for the modern city. > For Marketing & General Advocates> The challenge has officially shifted from storage to cognition. It’s incredible to see the VAST AI OS acting as the orchestration brain for real-world agents that can improve public safety in seconds. > Smart cities are finally getting the 'thinking' capabilities they need. Can't wait to see more of these real-time reasoning workflows in action at VAST FWD! > When> Monday Jan 5, 2026 ⋅ 5:10pm – 5:20pm (Mountain Time - Denver)> Organizer> Braxton Banning> braxton.banning@vastdata.com> Guests> (Guest list is too large to display)> Reply for jason.vallery@vastdata.com> Yes> No> Maybe> More options> Invitation from Google Calendar> You are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.
