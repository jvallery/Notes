# LPM board AI discussion

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**With**: TBD

## Summary

Prepared agenda and talk track for a Longmont Public Media board discussion on responsible AI video adoption, including a Sora 2 storyboard demo and a 12–24 month opportunity map for LPM and the City of Longmont. The document emphasizes provenance (C2PA), disclosure, consent (no real-person likeness without written consent), and planning for Colorado’s AI Act effective date of 2026-06-30, with suggested pilots and governance questions to drive decisions.
## Key Information
- Longmont Public Media (LPM) is a community media makerspace/public access TV hub (~5,000 sq ft) located at 457 4th Ave., Longmont, and regularly distributes civic content such as City Council sessions.
- NextLight is Longmont’s city-run, community-owned fiber network offering up to 10-Gig symmetrical service and an income-qualified Internet Assistance Program.
- Colorado AI Act (SB24-205), amended/delayed by SB25B-004, has an effective date of 2026-06-30 and includes duties for developers/deployers of “high-risk AI” (impact assessments, notices, appeal rights, disclosures).
- Sora 2 storyboard mode is positioned as enabling more controllable, multi-shot video creation; durations referenced are 15–25 seconds on web (25 seconds for Pro).
- C2PA Content Credentials are recommended for provenance, but platforms may strip metadata; visible on-screen disclosures and hosting originals on owned channels are advised.
- Safety/rights guidance: do not use real people’s likenesses without written consent; maintain releases and licenses; avoid depicting real local officials without consent.
- Municipal chatbot examples cited: Denver’s “Sunny” as a narrow, controlled assistant; NYC’s MyCity LLM bot as a cautionary example due to incorrect/illegal guidance.
- Suggested pilot concepts include civic micro-explainers, meeting highlights with provenance, and a digital equity series with NextLight.
