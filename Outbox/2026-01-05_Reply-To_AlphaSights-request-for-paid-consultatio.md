## Draft Response

Hi Olivia,  

Yes—I’m open to participating in AlphaSights’ paid consultation on corporate insider threat trends. I can cover macro trends, how internal risk/governance teams are evolving, and where I see the market heading over the next 12–24 months.  

I’ll use the scheduling link you sent to book a short briefing today. If you need to lock a time urgently, I’m available Wednesday, January 7 from 10:00–11:30am PT or Thursday, January 8 from 1:00–3:00pm PT.  

Before we meet, please send 3–5 specific questions you want to prioritize and confirm the expected duration and rate so we can use the time efficiently.  

Best,  
Jason Vallery
