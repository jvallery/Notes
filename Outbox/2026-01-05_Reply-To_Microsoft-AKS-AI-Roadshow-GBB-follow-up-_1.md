# Draft Reply to Tiffany Stonehill

**Regarding**: Microsoft AKS AI Roadshow (GBB) follow-up: share slides/code, pipeline sync, Global Namespace on Azure demo
**Urgency**: normal

---

## Key Points to Address

Confirm January timing for pipeline sync (Mohamad out next two weeks). Provide ETA for sending slides and code from the AKS AI Roadshow session and confirm what 'access' includes. Identify owner and next step for a Global Namespace on Azure demo/accelerator, and loop in Lior Genzel for engineering status.

## Draft Response

Hi Tiffany,  

We’ll send Microsoft the AKS AI Roadshow deck and the supporting code by Wednesday, January 7, 2026. “Access” will include the PDF deck, the demo manifests/scripts we used in the session (AKS deployment + VAST integration), and a short runbook with prerequisites and step-by-step instructions; if Microsoft needs a repo invite vs. a ZIP drop, tell me which distribution method you prefer and I’ll align it the same day.  

For the pipeline sync, since Mohamad is out the next two weeks, let’s lock Tuesday, January 13, 2026 from 10:00–10:30 AM PT with Mohamad and Kurt, plus you, Chris, and me. If that slot doesn’t work on the Microsoft side, the backup is Thursday, January 15, 2026 from 10:00–10:30 AM PT.  

On the Global Namespace on Azure demo/accelerator: Lior Genzel is the owner for engineering status and the build plan, and I’ll drive the roadmap alignment for the AI roadshow requirements. I’m looping Lior in now; by Friday, January 9, 2026 we’ll confirm the demo scope (what’s included in the accelerator), the target Azure reference architecture, and a delivery date we can commit to for roadshow inclusion.  

Thanks,  
Jason Vallery

## Original Summary

After VAST presented VAST + AKS to Microsoft Global Black Belt (GBB) AI infrastructure sellers on Tuesday, December 9, 2025, Microsoft requested the slides and code from the session and asked about building a Global Namespace on Azure demo/accelerator for the AI roadshow. Tiffany Stonehill offered to coordinate with Jason Vallery to send materials and deferred Global Namespace on Azure updates to Lior Genzel; Mohamad Al Jazaery asked to reconnect in January because he is out for the next two weeks.
