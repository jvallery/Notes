Hi Tiffany,

Thanks for looping me in on this. I'm glad to hear the presentation was well-received. 

**Core Response:**
To address Mohamad's request, I've coordinated with our team to prepare the slides and code. We'll have these materials ready for distribution by January 5th. Regarding the Global Namespace on Azure, Lior has the latest updates and will be ready to present a demo during the AI roadshow. 

**Proactive Ask:**
Could you confirm a time on Monday or Tuesday next week for us to sync on the current pipeline? This will help ensure we're aligned and ready to kick off January effectively.

**Next Steps:**
I'll ensure the slides and code are delivered to you and the team by the aforementioned date. Additionally, I'll follow up with Lior to ensure we're prepared for the demo. 

Looking forward to building on this momentum and wishing you a wonderful holiday season.

Best,
Jason
