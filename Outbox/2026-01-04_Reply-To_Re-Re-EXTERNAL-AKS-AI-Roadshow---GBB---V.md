Hi Tiffany,

Thanks for coordinating on the follow-up. I’ll ensure that the slides and access details are prepared and sent to Mohamad and Kurt early next week. I'll also check with Chris to confirm our plan regarding the demo or accelerator for showcasing the Global Namespace on Azure. Once I have more details, I'll update everyone involved.

For the meeting to discuss the current pipeline, it sounds like early January might be best, given Mohamad's schedule. Could we tentatively plan for the first week back after the holidays? I'll make sure our calendars align once we have a specific date in mind.

Wishing you a wonderful holiday season as well!

Best,  
Jason
