Hi David,

Happy New Year to you as well! Thanks for organizing the meeting at Wapos on Tuesday. I can confirm my attendance for the dinner and discussion about "2084." It will be great to catch up with everyone and wrap up our book discussion.

As for future meetings, I understand taking a break to reassess is important. If there's anything specific you'd like assistance with in planning or facilitating future gatherings, feel free to reach out.

Looking forward to Tuesday!

Best,  
Jason
