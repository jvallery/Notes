Hi David,

Thanks for reaching out and organizing the final chat about '2084' at Wapos. I hope you had a joyful holiday season!

I'm in for the meeting on Tuesday at 6:30 PM. Looking forward to wrapping up our discussion on '2084' and sharing some good times with everyone. It seems like a fitting way to bring this chapter of our book club to a close.

If there are any materials or topics you'd like us to prepare beforehand, please let me know. I'd be happy to contribute.

See you all soon!

Best, 
JV
