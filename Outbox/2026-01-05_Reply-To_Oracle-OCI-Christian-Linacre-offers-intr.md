## Draft Response

Hi Christian,  

Thanks for the quick reply—yes, please make the intro to Matt. Can you share Matt’s full name, email address, and his exact role title for DRCC/Alloy product management so I can come prepared?  

I’ll be in Seattle Tuesday, January 14 through Thursday, January 16. I can meet in person Tuesday 1/14 at 10:00–11:00 AM PT or 2:00–3:00 PM PT, Wednesday 1/15 at 9:00–10:00 AM PT or 3:30–4:30 PM PT, or Thursday 1/16 at 9:00–10:00 AM PT. If none of those work, send a couple of times that do and I’ll lock it in.  

Safe travels,  
Jason Vallery  
VP, Product Management – Cloud
