# Draft Reply to Karl Vietmeier

**Regarding**: Karl Vietmeier asks for guidance on ownership of GDC and Azure Local opportunities
**Urgency**: normal

## Key Points to Address

Acknowledge the ownership confusion when hardware pulls opportunities into on-prem teams. Provide a clear stance on whether Cloud Product Management owns GDC and Azure Local opportunities, define how to engage on-prem teams (RACI or handoff rules), and specify how aggressively to assert ownership to preserve hyperscaler alignment and execution visibility.

## Draft Response

Karl, Cloud Product Management should own GDC and Azure Local opportunities end-to-end, even when hardware is involved. We should assert that ownership proactively and consistently, because hyperscaler alignment, consumption motions, and partner execution visibility are the success factors—and those sit with Cloud PM.

The operating model I want is: Cloud PM is the single-threaded owner for strategy, positioning, partner engagement, and deal governance; the on-prem team is a required co-pilot for hardware sizing, BOM/pricing mechanics, and delivery readiness. Practically, Cloud PM stays accountable for the opportunity record, partner communications, and the “what/why” narrative; on-prem owns the “how much/when” for hardware and implementation, with clear SLAs for turnaround on sizing and quotes.

On aggressiveness: be firm at intake and at every stage gate—if the opportunity is GDC or Azure Local, it stays in the Cloud PM lane with on-prem engaged via a defined handoff checklist, not a transfer of ownership. If an on-prem team is already driving, we don’t fight in the account; we reset roles in the next internal sync and move governance back to Cloud PM while keeping the same customer-facing team to avoid churn.

If you’re aligned, I’ll send a one-page RACI and routing rule to Sales Ops and the on-prem PM leads by Wednesday, January 8, 2026, and we’ll start enforcing it for all new GDC/Azure Local opps effective Monday, January 12, 2026.

## Original Summary

Karl Vietmeier reports growing interest in whether VAST supports Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local, and notes confusion when on-prem teams take ownership once hardware is involved. He recommends cloud product management own these opportunities due to hyperscaler relationships and cloud-consumption alignment, and asks Jason Vallery how aggressively to assert ownership and how much control to maintain.
