Hi Edwin,

Great to meet you, and thanks for reaching out! I appreciate you sharing your resume. I'm currently reviewing it and will assess potential opportunities within VAST Data that align with your expertise in FP&A.

Could you let me know your availability for a call next week? I suggest either Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon, Mountain Time. This will allow us to discuss more about VAST and any relevant openings in Colorado.

I'll also keep Adem in the loop on any developments. Looking forward to our conversation.

Best,
JV
