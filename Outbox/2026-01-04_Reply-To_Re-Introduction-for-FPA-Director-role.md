Hi Adem and Edwin,

Thank you for reaching out. It's great to connect with both of you.

Edwin, I’ve received your resume and appreciate you sending it over. I’ll review it and see where there might be a fit within our team. In the meantime, I’ll coordinate with our HR department to explore potential opportunities in Colorado. 

Let’s set up a call next week to discuss this further and give you more insights into VAST Data’s culture and operations. Could you let me know your availability?

Looking forward to our conversation.

Best,  
Jason
