## Draft Response

Hi Rick,

Thanks for the clear update. I’ll align the Cloud product/GTM teams to route all RevOps needs through Stacy effective Monday, 2025-12-22, and we’ll keep executing against the current GTM priorities without change.

Please pass my thanks to Cristina for her impact on the business, and let Stacy know I’m available this week to help with any handoffs or decisions that need quick closure.

Best,  
Jason
