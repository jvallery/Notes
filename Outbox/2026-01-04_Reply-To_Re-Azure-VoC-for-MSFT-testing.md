Hi Ray,

Thanks for reaching out regarding the Azure VoC request from Microsoft. As Lior mentioned, our Azure offering isn't quite ready for this type of testing, so we won't be pursuing the Azure VoC instance at this time. 

It might be beneficial to schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft team to discuss our current capabilities and explore alternative solutions that align with our existing PoC setup. This could help manage expectations and maintain our strong relationship with them.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can assist with or if further clarification is needed.

Best,  
Jason
