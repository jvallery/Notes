Hi Ray and Team,

Thanks for bringing this to my attention. Given the current status of our Azure VoC, pursuing this request further doesn't align with our readiness and strategic priorities.

**Performance Profile:**
Currently, the Azure VoC instance isn't optimized for GPU-centric workloads, which aligns with our focus on CPU-bound benchmarks. Therefore, the performance may not meet the expectations set by Microsoft's current needs in their lab.

**Next Steps:**
Ray, I recommend setting up a follow-up call with the requesting team at Microsoft to communicate this decision effectively, as Lior suggested. It's crucial to maintain transparency about our current focus and limitations.

**Action Items:**
- I will ensure that we have a clear internal communication strategy regarding our Azure capabilities to prevent similar requests from causing confusion in the future.
- Lior, if you could spearhead the call to provide context and manage expectations, that would be appreciated.

Please let me know if there's anything specific you need from me to facilitate this process.

Best,
Jason Vallery
