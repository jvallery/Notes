# Draft Reply to Peter Imming

**Regarding**: Intro to Sebastien Berube (AWS) and coffee meeting scheduled for Jan 7, 2026 in Lafayette
**Urgency**: normal

## Key Points to Address

Confirm whether the January 7, 2026 8:00am coffee meeting in Lafayette works, and if needed propose an alternate time/location in Boulder County.

## Draft Response

Hi Peter,  

Yes—January 7, 2026 at 8:00am in Lafayette works for me. I’ve got Sebastien’s calendar invite with the location and will be there.  

If anything changes on his side, I can also do Wednesday, January 7 from 8:30–9:00am in Lafayette, or 8:00am in Boulder (downtown) as an easy alternate within Boulder County.  

Thanks again for making the intro—appreciate it.
