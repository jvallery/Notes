## Draft Response

Hi Perla,  

Thanks for the reminder—I'll submit my feedback on the Draft Strategic Plan via the form by 2025-12-18. I also appreciate the preview that Hannah (Big Picture Impact) and Andrea Ostroy will join the January board meeting to share the first look at the designed plan.  

I’ve got the December board meeting on my calendar for Wednesday. If anything changes on timing or materials you want us to review in advance of January, please send them along.  

Best,  
Jason Vallery
