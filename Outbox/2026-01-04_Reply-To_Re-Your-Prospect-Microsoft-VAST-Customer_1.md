Hi Tiffany,

Thanks for including me in this conversation. Given Trevor is currently leading a technical evaluation for us at the UK Met Office, it's crucial we maintain a clear line between prospect and customer resource access. I understand your suggestion to hold off on granting portal access aligns with our typical approach for prospects.

Lior's plan to reach out to Trevor for a clearer understanding of his objectives is a great step. This will ensure we're aligned on expectations and can better assess if access might be necessary at a later stage based on the outcomes of their ongoing proof-of-concept.

I'll coordinate with Lior to stay updated on this interaction and will circle back if any adjustments are needed based on Trevor's feedback. Let's continue to keep communication open as we progress with Microsoft.

Best,
Jason
