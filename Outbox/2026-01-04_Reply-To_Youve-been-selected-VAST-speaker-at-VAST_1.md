Hi Kirstin,

Thank you for the opportunity to serve as a spokesperson at VAST Forward. It's exciting to see the program come together so robustly, with diverse sessions and the hands-on labs that Andy and Alon are leading. I'll make sure to review the breakout sessions link and prepare accordingly.

I appreciate the detailed schedule you've outlined. I'll be ready for the intro call on January 6 and look forward to the prep sessions. This event is a great chance to connect more deeply with our customers and showcase the exciting developments at VAST.

If any conflicts arise, I will reach out to you and Jeff directly as advised. Meanwhile, I’m looking forward to collaborating with the team on this.

Happy holidays to you and the team!

Best,  
Jason
