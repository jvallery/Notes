# Draft Reply to Tiffany Stonehill

**Regarding**: Microsoft AKS AI Roadshow (GBB) follow-up: share slides/code, pipeline sync, Global Namespace on Azure demo
**Urgency**: normal

---

## Key Points to Address

Confirm we will send the slides and code from the VAST + AKS presentation, clarify what 'access' means (repo link, demo environment, or recording), propose January dates for a pipeline sync given Mohamad Al Jazaery is out for two weeks, and route the Global Namespace on Azure demo/accelerator question to Lior Genzel with a commitment to follow up with a concrete plan.

## Draft Response

Hi Tiffany,  

I’ll send the VAST + AKS deck and the supporting code artifacts by Wednesday, January 8, 2026. To make sure we deliver what the GBB team expects, can you confirm what “access” means on Microsoft’s side: (1) a GitHub/Azure DevOps repo link, (2) a packaged zip of the sample manifests/scripts, (3) access to a hosted demo environment, and/or (4) a recording of the session?  

For the pipeline sync (given Mohamad is out), I propose we lock 30 minutes on Tuesday, January 14, 2026 at 10:00–10:30am PT or Thursday, January 16, 2026 at 1:00–1:30pm PT. If neither works, send two times that do and I’ll get it on the calendar.  

On the Global Namespace on Azure demo/accelerator for the AI roadshow: I’m routing this to Lior Genzel today and will come back to you with a concrete plan (scope, demo flow, and delivery timeline) by Friday, January 10, 2026. If you can share the specific roadshow slot/date(s) and the target audience persona (GBB sellers vs. customer-facing), we’ll align the demo to that format.  

Best,  
Jason Vallery

## Original Summary

After VAST presented VAST + AKS to Microsoft Global Black Belt (GBB) AI infrastructure sellers, Microsoft requested the slides and code from the presentation and asked about a Global Namespace on Azure demo/accelerator for the AI roadshow. Tiffany Stonehill will coordinate with Jason Vallery to send slides and access, and she deferred Global Namespace on Azure updates to Lior Genzel; Mohamad Al Jazaery will be out for two weeks and asked to reconnect in January.
