Hi Erika,

Thank you for the recap of the IHDF executive session. I appreciate the update and understand the confidentiality of the topics discussed.

Regarding the fundraising focus, it's encouraging to hear about the formation of a broader committee. If there's any way I can support these efforts through our network or resources, please let me know. It's great to know that Perla is assessing staff needs, as having the right team in place is crucial.

The potential acquisition of the former church in Longmont sounds intriguing. I see that Perla will be sharing the SWOT document. I look forward to reviewing the early assessments from Maureen, Jorin, Tracy, and Perla on this opportunity. Please keep me in the loop as the discussions advance.

If there's anything specific you think I should dive deeper into or any follow-up required on my end, feel free to reach out.

Best,  
Jason
