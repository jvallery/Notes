Hi Vinita,

Thank you for confirming the meeting time. I'm looking forward to our discussion on December 15th at 10am PT. During our meeting, I'd like to explore potential collaboration avenues between VAST and Nebius, particularly how we can leverage our strengths in AI infrastructure and data platforms.

To ensure a productive conversation, could you please share any specific topics or questions you would like to address? This will help us tailor our discussion to your interests and priorities.

I'll also prepare a brief overview of VAST's AI Operating System and its capabilities, which we can discuss. Let me know if there's anything else you need from my side before our call.

Best, JV
