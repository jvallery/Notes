## Key Points to Address

## Draft Response

Hi Adem,  

Thanks for the introduction to Edwin—appreciate you thinking of VAST. I received Edwin Trogler’s resume and will take a close look.  

To make sure I connect him with the right people, what specific introductions are you looking for me to facilitate—Recruiting, Finance leadership, or a specific FP&A hiring manager in Colorado? If you can point me to the target team/person, I’ll route it directly.  

Edwin also asked for a quick call next week to learn more about VAST and FP&A opportunities in Colorado. I can do 30 minutes on Tuesday 1/7 at 10:00 AM MT, Wednesday 1/8 at 2:00 PM MT, or Thursday 1/9 at 11:30 AM MT—do any of those work for Edwin, or should I offer a different window?  

Best,  
Jason Vallery  
VP, Product Management – Cloud  
VAST Data
