## Draft Response

Hi Adem,  

Thanks for the introduction to Edwin—appreciate you thinking of us. I received his resume and will set up a quick call with him next week to learn more about his background and what he’s looking for in Colorado.  

For scheduling, I can do Tuesday, January 7 at 10:00–10:20am MT, Wednesday, January 8 at 1:00–1:20pm MT, or Thursday, January 9 at 9:30–9:50am MT. If none of those work, send me two times that do and I’ll lock one in.  

On the FP&A Director question: I’m going to check with our finance leadership and recruiting on current and anticipated FP&A Director (or adjacent) openings in Colorado, and I’ll get back to you with a clear answer and next steps by Wednesday, January 8 EOD MT.  

Best,  
Jason Vallery  
VP, Product Management – Cloud
