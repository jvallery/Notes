# Draft Reply: Re: Azure VoC for MSFT testing

Hi Ray,

Thanks for bringing this to my attention. As Lior mentioned, we're currently focusing on demonstrating VAST's capabilities with the physical PoC system at Microsoft's lab. The Azure VoC isn't quite ready for the GPU performance testing as requested. 

In terms of performance expectations for the Azure VoC, we are still fine-tuning and aligning it with our broader cloud strategy. We've had ongoing discussions about optimizing our cloud offerings and are closely monitoring the development of our Azure integration to ensure it meets our high standards.

It's crucial to maintain our current trajectory and focus on showcasing the strengths of our existing systems. I'll coordinate with Lior to ensure communication with the Microsoft team reflects our current capabilities and limitations. If there's any change or update, I'll make sure you're informed promptly.

Best,  
Jason
