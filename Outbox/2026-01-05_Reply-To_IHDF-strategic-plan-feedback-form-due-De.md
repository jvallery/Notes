## Draft Response

Hi Perla,  

I’ll complete the IHDF Strategic Plan Feedback Form and submit it by Wednesday, December 18, 2025. If anything needs deeper discussion, I’ll follow up directly with Hannah (hanna@bigpictureimpact.com) and Andrea Ostroy (andreaostroy01@gmail.com) and can also request a 1:1.  

Thanks for the heads-up on the January board meeting preview—looking forward to Hannah and Andrea’s first look at the designed plan and continuing the discussion with the full board then.  

Best,  
Jason Vallery
