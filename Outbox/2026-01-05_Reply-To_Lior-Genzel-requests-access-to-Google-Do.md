## Draft Response

Hi Lior,

I approved your access request to “VAST and Azure Integration.docx” with view and comment permissions. If you need edit access for updates, reply with what you’re changing and I’ll upgrade it the same day.

If you run into any access issues, send me the link you’re using and I’ll verify the sharing settings.

Thanks,
