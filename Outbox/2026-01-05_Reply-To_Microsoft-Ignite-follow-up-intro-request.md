## Draft Response

Hi Lior,

Thanks again for the intro to Sushant. I’ll take point on the follow-up and will propose a few Microsoft Teams times directly to him today.

For the architecture docs from the San Francisco discussion, I’ll send Sushant our VAST Cloud reference architecture (Azure-focused), the VAST Data Platform architecture overview (disaggregated shared-everything), and the security/networking integration notes we walked through at Ignite. If you want me to include anything else you covered with him (e.g., specific Azure services or deployment patterns), reply back and I’ll add it before I send.

For the intro call options, I’ll offer Sushant these slots (Pacific Time): Tue, Dec 16, 2025 10:00–10:30 AM PT; Wed, Dec 17, 2025 1:00–1:30 PM PT; or Thu, Dec 18, 2025 9:00–9:30 AM PT. If none of those work, I’ll ask him for two alternatives and we’ll lock a time the same day.

Best,  
Jason Vallery  
VP, Product Management – Cloud  
VAST Data
