# Draft Reply to Erika Smith

**Regarding**: IHDF executive session recap: public stance risk, fundraising committee, Longmont church acquisition exploration
**Urgency**: normal

## Key Points to Address

Thank Erika Smith for the confidential recap, confirm confidentiality, ask for any missing details needed for Board context (public stance decision process, fundraising committee charter and membership, and next steps/timeline for the Longmont church feasibility/SWOT).

## Draft Response

Hi Erika,  

Thank you for the confidential recap of the IHDF executive session—I appreciate you taking the time to capture the key points, and I’ll keep it strictly within the Board/executive context. Since I wasn’t in the room, I want to make sure I have enough detail to represent the discussion accurately and help drive clean next steps.  

On the “public stance” risk: what specific decision process and criteria did the group align on (or propose) to determine when IHDF will take a public stance while protecting tax-exempt status and minimizing donor/community fallout? If there’s an agreed escalation path (e.g., ED + Board Chair review, counsel check, Board vote threshold) and any “red lines” or examples discussed, please share.  

On the fundraising committee: who is expected to be on it, what’s the charter (scope, goals, cadence), and does it have any budget authority or is it purely advisory to the Board/ED? Also, when Perla completes her assessment of staff support needs, can you send it along (or let me know when to expect it) so we can align resources and avoid creating a committee that can’t execute.  

On the Longmont former church exploration: when Perla shares the initial SWOT draft you co-created, please forward it, and can you confirm the feasibility group’s timeline to report back to the Board (target meeting/date) and the key assumptions/risks they’re using to frame the initial recommendation (e.g., acquisition/renovation cost ranges, zoning/use constraints, operating model, funding plan, and downside scenarios)? If you don’t have those specifics yet, I’m happy to wait—just let me know when you expect the group to have a first cut (e.g., by Friday, January 17, 2026, or ahead of the next Board meeting).  

Best,  
Jason Vallery

## Original Summary

Erika Smith sent a confidential recap of an IHDF executive session that I missed. Key points were risks of taking public stances (tax-exempt status and donor/community impact), agreement to form a broader fundraising committee, and an early-stage exploration of acquiring a former church in Longmont with a small group to assess feasibility and report back to the Board.
