**Regarding**: Board game session planning, week after Christmas 2025 (Nemesis / Betrayal at House on the Hill)
**Urgency**: normal

## Key Points to Address

Confirm my availability and preference for the proposed board game session times (Saturday 2025-12-27 1:00pm vs Monday 2025-12-29 1:00pm), and ask Brian Bearly to confirm the final selection and send logistics (address, what game(s) to bring/expect).

## Draft Response

Hi David,  

I’m available for both Saturday 12/27 at 1:00pm and Monday 12/29 at 1:00pm, with a preference for Monday 12/29 at 1:00pm since it seems to work best for the group. I can also make an evening option work if that’s where everyone lands.  

Can you ask Brian to confirm the final date/time and send the logistics for his place (address, parking/entry notes, and what time you want people arriving)? Also let us know whether we’re planning on Nemesis, Betrayal at House on the Hill, or both, and if there’s anything specific you want me to bring.  

Thanks,  
Jason
