# Draft Reply to Brian Bearly

**Regarding**: Board game session planning (Nemesis) week after Christmas 2025
**Urgency**: normal

## Key Points to Address

Confirm whether Jason Vallery can attend and which proposed time works best (Saturday 2025-12-27 at 1:00pm vs Monday 2025-12-29 at 1:00pm), and whether an evening option is needed.

## Draft Response

Hi Brian,

I’m in, and Monday, December 29 at 1:00pm works best for me. If the group is already leaning that way, I’d lock that in and call it done.

If you want a backup, I can also make Saturday, December 27 at 1:00pm, but Monday is my preference.

For planning, I’m good with Nemesis as the main event. If we have time and energy after, I’m also up for a quick Betrayal of the House on the Hill, but I’d optimize for getting a full Nemesis game in.

Once you confirm the date, send the address and anything you want people to bring (snacks, drinks, etc.), and I’ll plan around it.

Thanks for organizing this.

Jason
