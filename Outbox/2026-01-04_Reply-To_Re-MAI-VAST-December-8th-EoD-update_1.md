Hi Jeff,

I understand the urgency around securing supply chain resources for our upcoming deployments and the complications posed by current lead times. From our recent discussions, it's clear that there is no expectation for using our supply chain for Microsoft's needs. Given the constraints, we need a robust plan with Microsoft to align timelines and expectations. I will ensure this is a priority in our upcoming talks.

Regarding the sourcing of the required 2 EB, I'm coordinating with Lior to identify the most strategic environments for Anson's PoC. This will allow us to integrate his plans with Kushal's effectively and push forward with the necessary validations. I'll also touch base with Alon to explore our supply options and potential partners to meet these demands.

I'll keep you updated on our progress and any developments that arise following our meeting tomorrow. Let's ensure we have a clear path forward, both in terms of supply chain strategy and stakeholder engagement.

Best,
Jason
