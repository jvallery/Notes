# Draft Reply to Brian Bearly

**Regarding**: Planning board game session at Brian Bearly's house (week after Christmas 2025)
**Urgency**: normal

## Key Points to Address

Confirm my availability and preference for Saturday 2025-12-27 at 1:00pm vs Monday 2025-12-29 at 1:00pm (or propose an evening alternative if neither works).

## Draft Response

Hi Brian,

I’m in, and Monday, December 29 at 1:00pm works for me. If you lock that in, I’ll plan on being there.

If you end up needing to shift to an evening slot instead, I can also make Monday, December 29 after 6:30pm.

Let me know what you decide and if you want me to bring anything (snacks, drinks, etc.). I’m game for Nemesis, and I’m also good with Betrayal if we have time.

Thanks,  
Jason

## Original Summary

Email thread coordinating a board game session at Brian Bearly's home the week after Christmas 2025, initially centered on the game Nemesis. Brian proposed Saturday 2025-12-27 at 1:00pm or Monday 2025-12-29 at 1:00pm, and both Trent Stickney and David Ellis indicated Monday 2025-12-29 at 1:00pm works for them; Brandon & Priscilla Dodsworth declined due to travel to Texas over New Years.
