Hi David,

Thanks for sharing your draft and the plan for TMIMITW. It sounds like an exciting direction with a great mix of engaging discussions and social activities. The start date flexibility is a good idea, allowing everyone to adjust their schedules.

Regarding the invite list, Trent, Brandon, Brian, and the Mikes seem like a solid group. It's nice to have a balance of familiar faces and new perspectives. As for the reading suggestions, both books look intriguing. "The Immortal Mind" seems particularly fascinating and might spark some deep discussions.

If you're looking for feedback by Jan 6, I suggest confirming the initial meeting date and book choice with everyone. This way, we can ensure a smooth transition from the book club to TMIMITW.

Best,  
Jason
