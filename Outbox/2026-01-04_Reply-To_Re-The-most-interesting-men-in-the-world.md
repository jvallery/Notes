Hi David,

Thanks for sharing your thoughts on transitioning from the book club to 'The Most Interesting Men in the World' (TMIMITW). I think it’s a great idea to keep the focus on engaging discussions while adding some variety with occasional social outings.

Regarding the invite list, Trent, Brandon, Brian, and the Mikes sound like a solid group to start with. For the first meeting, I’m available on either January 27th or February 3rd, depending on what works best for everyone else. I’ll reach out to Trent and Brian to see which date they prefer and will get back to you with their availability.

The book suggestions look intriguing. 'The Immortal Mind' seems like a fascinating read, and I’m looking forward to our discussions around it. I'll also check out 'Fashionable Nonsense' as it seems like a thought-provoking choice.

Let me know if there's anything specific you'd like me to do to help get this off the ground.

Best,
JV
