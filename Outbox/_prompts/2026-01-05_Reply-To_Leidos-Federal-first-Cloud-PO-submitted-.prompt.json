This win is to enable the cloud strategy for multiple locations (eventually cloud and on-prem) using our differentiated solution sets, ABAC, Global Namespace, Similarity, DASE (on-prem), and our site-site \"meshed\" replication technology.\n> Business Reasons for Win:\n> Strategic relationships with key leadership along with demos, POC, technical briefs, & Q&A discussions, allowed us to advance our solution sets across multiple fronts with Leidos DoD and Civ principal business and technical leads. The price points needed to win were very specific and we were able to meet those requirements.\n> Win Summary:\n> Leidos is pursuing Dept of Defense and Civilian Hybrid Cloud Strategies and positioning VAST Data as a foundational component of their \"Mission OS\" as they go to market in multiple sectors. This win is to enable the cloud strategy for multiple locations both cloud and on-prem using our differentiated solution sets.\n> Shout out:\n> This has been a team effort across Fed and commercial technical & business leads from the start. The relationships, the teamwork, and the amazing ability to turn around responses and get Leidos the the technical information they needed quickly was evident. Biggest shout out to FSI Leader Jenn Azzolina for establishing relationships w/ key leadership staff early on in the process, could not have gotten this far without her guidance and Federal System Integrator experience. Shout out to my SE Mark Maynard for doing so many technical briefs I lost count. Another shout out to Fed Civilian Director Sean O'Donnell for attending the Leidos Civ leadership meetings which helped to get buy-in from those teams. Thanks to Fed Field Tech Director Jeno Cram and FSI SE Manager Steve Hill for attending all those briefings with the team and fielding technical curve ball questions time and time again. Big thanks to CTO Matt Rogers & AI Enterprise Lead Ofir Zan for a slew of AI and Security briefs & workshops we had to do along the way. Can't forget DoD AE Justin Bradd and his SE Mark Supplee for assisting in the on-prem installation at the Leidos Gaithersburg facility - clutch assist that really helped us move this forward internally w/ Leidos. Also can't forget Sales Ops in this as I finagled my way around SFDC to get this all to the finish line - Thanks to Felipe Escuton, Dee Berar, Ali P, & the spectacular Georgie Rager for all the assists. And lastly,... shout out to Randy Hayes for stepping up for the random technical briefs that would come out of the blue w/ Leidos VP's and CTO leadership.

Jeff Denworth asked Jason Vallery to ensure these Cloud POs are tracked to understand customer expectations, user experience, cloud product implications, and business development angles.\n\n## KEY POINTS TO ADDRESS\nAcknowledge Jeff Denworth's request to track Cloud POs. Confirm you will capture Leidos Federal FOpp-4197 details (software-only GovCloud deployment, on-prem connectivity for resilient demo) and propose a lightweight tracking mechanism (owner, customer expectations, UX feedback, product gaps, BD learnings). Ask for any specific format or stakeholders Jeff wants included.\n\n## QUESTIONS ASKED\n[\"For Leidos Federal opportunity FOpp-4197, is there any hardware component involved, or is it strictly software-only (as later stated by Greg Castellucci)?\", \"What specific customer expectations and user experience requirements does Leidos Federal have for the GovCloud plus on-prem resilient demo ('Golden Dome')?\"]\n\n## COMMITMENTS MADE\nNone\n\n## CONTEXT\n- Recipient first name: Jeff\n- Urgency: normal\n\n## RELEVANT CONTEXT FROM MY NOTES (PRIVATE - DO NOT QUOTE VERBATIM)\n## RELEVANT ENTITY CONTEXT\n\n### Jeff Denworth\nKey Facts: Jason Vallery reports to Jeff Denworth at VAST Data.\n\n### Cloud\nKey Facts: No generally available, transactable \u201cVAST on Cloud\u201d offering exists today; current work is roadmap plus early marketplace/private-offer motions.; FY26 prioritization is core layers first (cloud primitives, control plane stance, tenancy, operability/SLOs) before building higher-layer services.; Marketplace offers are necessary for transactability, but VM economics can be non-competitive at scale; longer-term paths include cloud primitives and potentially CSP data-center hardware.\n\n### Leidos Federal\nKey Facts: Leidos leaders are expected to speak at VAST Forward about how they use VAST Data in production environments.\n\n### Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\nKey Facts: Oracle was listed as a topic for an AlphaSights expert discussion request sent to Jason Vallery.\n\nWrite the complete email body now (greeting through signature):"
