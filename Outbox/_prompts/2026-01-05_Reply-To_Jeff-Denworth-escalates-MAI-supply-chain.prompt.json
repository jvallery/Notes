      "content": "Write a reply to Jeff Denworth about: Jeff Denworth escalates MAI supply chain risk and asks if Microsoft expects VAST supply chain\n\n## EMAIL SUMMARY\nJeff Denworth raised a critical concern that VAST is selling out of inventory, lead times are increasing, and nothing is reserved for Microsoft. He asked whether Microsoft MAI expects to use VAST's supply chain and emphasized that if Microsoft wants an April to June 2026 deployment, VAST needs a plan immediately.\n\n## KEY POINTS TO ADDRESS\nReply to Jeff Denworth confirming whether Microsoft MAI expects VAST to supply hardware and flash, and outline immediate next steps to create a supply and ordering plan for an April 2026 to June 2026 deployment given no inventory is reserved. Also confirm you will send your latest MAI analysis and align on who owns sourcing and reservation with VAST Operations.\n\n## QUESTIONS ASKED\n[\"Does Microsoft MAI expect to use VAST Data's supply chain for the MAI storage deployment, or will Microsoft source and allocate flash and hardware independently?\", \"If Microsoft MAI wants an April 2026 to June 2026 deployment, what hardware and flash capacity must be ordered now, from which suppliers, and under what internal reservation plan at VAST Data?\", \"Where should Anson (Qi)'s VAST proof of concept run to access 1,000 to 2,000 GPUs for scale testing, MAI and Vipin environment, Nscale, or CoreWeave?\"]\n\n## COMMITMENTS MADE\n[\"Jeff Denworth stated that he and Jason Vallery will talk the next day (2025-12-22) and that the situation is serious.\", \"Lior Genzel committed to share a detailed end-of-day summary of where the MAI engagement stands.\", \"Lior Genzel committed to send an end-of-day or end-of-week summary incorporating Jason Vallery's feedback.\"]\n\n## CONTEXT\n- Recipient first name: Jeff\n- Urgency: urgent\n\n\tWrite the complete email body now (greeting through signature):"
