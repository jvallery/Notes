Walmart plans an on-prem-only big data POC and requires integration with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), which may put Alluxio back in a leading position. Jeff asked PM management to analyze requirements and determine what should enter the product plan, with a focus on a path to full estate takeover.\n\n## KEY POINTS TO ADDRESS\nAcknowledge Jeff Denworth's request, confirm PM ownership to analyze Walmart's re-stated requirements (unified namespace, GCS integration, on-prem-only POC), outline immediate next steps with Mikey and team, and propose a concrete plan to assess competitive risk versus Alluxio and feed recommendations into the product plan.\n\n## QUESTIONS ASKED\n[\"What specific Walmart requirements (unified namespace behavior, GCS integration method, database-layer constraints) must VAST satisfy to win the long-term hybrid solution?\", \"What is the competitive gap versus Alluxio for Walmart's hybrid and GCS integration requirements, and what product changes close it?\"]\n\n## COMMITMENTS MADE\n[\"Jeff Denworth delegated to VAST Product Management leadership to work with Mikey and team to analyze Walmart's re-stated requirements and determine what should enter the VAST product plan.\"]\n\n## CONTEXT\n- Recipient first name: Jeff\n- Urgency: urgent\n\n## RELEVANT CONTEXT FROM MY NOTES (PRIVATE - DO NOT QUOTE VERBATIM)\n## RELEVANT ENTITY CONTEXT\n\n### Jeff Denworth\nKey Facts: Jason Vallery reports to Jeff Denworth at VAST Data.\n\n### Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\nKey Facts: Oracle was listed as a topic for an AlphaSights expert discussion request sent to Jason Vallery.\n\nWrite the complete email body now (greeting through signature):"
