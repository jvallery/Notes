Jeff emphasized that if Microsoft wants an April to June 2026 deployment window, VAST needs a concrete plan immediately because nothing is reserved for Microsoft.\n\n## KEY POINTS TO ADDRESS\nAcknowledge Jeff Denworth's supply chain concern, answer whether Microsoft MAI expects to use VAST supply chain, and propose an immediate plan to secure sourcing and delivery for an April 2026 to June 2026 deployment window. Include current status on any inventory reservation, what VAST Operations can commit to, and next steps to de-risk ordering for the stated capacity requirements (2EB and/or 100EB).\n\n## QUESTIONS ASKED\n[\"Does Microsoft MAI expect to use VAST Data supply chain for the deployment, or will Microsoft source hardware and flash independently?\", \"What is the concrete ordering and sourcing plan to deliver Microsoft MAI capacity requirements (2EB mentioned by Jeff Denworth, 100EB mentioned earlier) given constrained supply chain and rising lead times?\", \"Which environment should host Anson (Qi) VAST PoC for 1,000 to 2,000 GPU scale testing: Microsoft MAI/Vipin, Nscale, or CoreWeave?\"]\n\n## COMMITMENTS MADE\n[\"Jeff Denworth stated he and Jason Vallery will talk the next day (2025-12-22) and emphasized the situation is serious.\", \"Lior Genzel committed to sharing an end-of-day or end-of-week summary of status (in the Dec 12 thread).\"]\n\n## CONTEXT\n- Recipient first name: Jeff\n- Urgency: urgent\n\n\tWrite the complete email body now (greeting through signature):"
