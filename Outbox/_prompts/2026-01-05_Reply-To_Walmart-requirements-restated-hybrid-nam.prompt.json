Walmart plans an on-prem-only big data POC in 2025 and any forward solution must integrate with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), which may put Alluxio back in a leading position.\n\n## KEY POINTS TO ADDRESS\nAcknowledge Jeff Denworth's request, confirm you will drive analysis of Walmart's restated requirements, propose a working session with Mikey and relevant team members, and outline initial hypotheses on unified namespace and GCS integration options plus competitive mitigation vs Alluxio.\n\n## QUESTIONS ASKED\n[\"What specific Walmart requirements (functional and non-functional) were restated in the internal requirements meeting beyond unified namespace and GCS integration?\", \"What is the exact scope, success criteria, and timeline for Walmart's on-prem-only big data POC planned for 2025?\", \"What integration does Walmart mean by 'integration with GCS' (namespace, data access protocol, metadata/catalog integration, or database-layer integration)?\"]\n\n## COMMITMENTS MADE\n[\"Jeff Denworth stated he is leaving the next steps with VAST product management leadership to work with Mikey and team to analyze Walmart's restated requirements and determine product plan implications.\"]\n\n## CONTEXT\n- Recipient first name: Jeff\n- Urgency: urgent\n\n## RELEVANT CONTEXT FROM MY NOTES (PRIVATE - DO NOT QUOTE VERBATIM)\n## RELEVANT ENTITY CONTEXT\n\n### Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\nKey Facts: Oracle was listed as a topic for an AlphaSights expert discussion request sent to Jason Vallery.\n\n### Jeff Denworth\nKey Facts: Jason Vallery reports to Jeff Denworth at VAST Data.\n\nWrite the complete email body now (greeting through signature):"
