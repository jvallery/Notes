Hi Tiffany,

Thanks for looping me in. I'm glad to hear that the presentation to the GBB team went well. I'll work on getting the slides and access details to Mohamad and Kurt as per your coordination.

Regarding the pipeline discussion, how about we aim for a meeting in the first week of January? I can coordinate with Mohamad and ensure we're all aligned. It seems like everyone's schedule will be more open then, and we can dive deeper into the details.

For the Global Namespace on Azure, I'll follow up with Lior to make sure he's ready to provide the latest updates from engineering. It's great that he's already involved with the most recent developments.

Wishing you a happy holiday season too. Looking forward to continuing our momentum in the new year!

Best,  
Jason
