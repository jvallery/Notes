Hi David,

Thanks for including me in the conversation. I appreciate the heads-up about the board game night. It sounds like a fun event, and I'm definitely interested in participating.

Regarding the date, I'll check if there's any update from Brian about the specific evening. Once we have that information, we can coordinate to ensure everyone can make it. I also like your suggestion of including "The Haunting on the House on the Hill" as an option—it's a great choice that could add some variety to the evening.

Let's keep in touch as we finalize the details. Looking forward to it!

Best,  
Jason
