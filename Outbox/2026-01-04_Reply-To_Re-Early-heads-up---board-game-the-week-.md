Hi David and everyone,

Thanks for including me in the plans for the board game session. The game Nemesis sounds exciting, and I’d love to join if we can settle on a date that works for everyone.

David, you mentioned considering "Betrayal at House on the Hill" as well, which is a great idea. I’m flexible with dates, but it would be helpful to finalize a specific evening soon so I can plan accordingly.

What about setting a tentative date for, say, Thursday, December 28th? If that works, I can confirm my availability right away.

Looking forward to a fun game night!

Best, JV
