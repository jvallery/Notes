# Draft Reply to Renen Hallak

**Regarding**: CES 2026 planning for NVIDIA Live, press cycle, and Microsoft Jay Parikh meeting
**Urgency**: urgent

---

## Key Points to Address

Confirm whether Renen Hallak will arrive in Las Vegas on January 5, 2026 for NVIDIA Live; confirm who owns arranging the Jay Parikh meeting with Microsoft; confirm who will approve NVIDIA press release mentions and the VAST press release tied to the January 5, 2026 3:00 PM PT embargo lift; confirm scheduling for the Monday, December 29, 2025 review with Renen Hallak and Gilad and required California team attendee.

## Draft Response

Renen — I’d like to lock CES execution this week: please confirm you’ll be in Las Vegas on Monday, January 5, 2026 in time to attend NVIDIA Live, even if your flash vendor meetings remain unchanged. If you can’t make NVIDIA Live in person, I’ll align an alternate plan for how we cover the moments we need from that program.

On the Jay Parikh meeting: you noted you’re adding the Microsoft team to arrange it—who is the specific Microsoft contact (name + email) that owns scheduling, and do you want that to run through you or should I have our BD lead engage directly? If you send the contact by end of day Wednesday, January 7, 2026, I’ll ensure we have a tight agenda and the right VAST attendees.

For approvals tied to the January 5, 2026 3:00 PM PT embargo lift: I propose final approver for any NVIDIA press release mentions of VAST (CME/Rubin/Open Models) is you, with Kirstin coordinating redlines and me as backup if you’re in vendor meetings. For the VAST press release that rides the same embargo, final approval should be you + Gilad, with Kirstin/Marianne owning comms workflow and legal sign-off.

Finally, please confirm the review on Monday, December 29, 2025 (I suggest 10:00–10:45 AM PT) with you + Gilad + me, and identify the California team member working on Jensen’s press conference content who must attend so we can close the loop on messaging and assets in that session.
