# Draft Reply to Christian Linacre

**Regarding**: Oracle OCI intro: Christian Linacre connects Jason Vallery with Matthew Thomson for Seattle meeting
**Urgency**: urgent

## Key Points to Address

Confirm which Thursday time slot works (11:30-12:30, 1:30-2:30, or 3:00 PM), clarify the exact date, and propose meeting location in Seattle. Optionally include whether Lior Genzel will join.

## Draft Response

Christian — thanks for the intro to Matthew. I can meet in Seattle on Thursday, December 11, 2025, and the 1:30–2:30 PM window works best for me.

Can you please confirm that Matthew meant Thu 12/11 (vs. another Thursday) and share the preferred location? If easiest, I’m happy to meet at Oracle’s Seattle office; otherwise I can do a nearby coffee spot within a 10-minute walk of downtown.

Also, please let Matthew know Lior Genzel is planning to join unless his travel changes; I’ll confirm final attendees by Wednesday, December 10 at 12:00 PM PT.
