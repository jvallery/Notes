# Draft Reply to Brian Evans

**Regarding**: Cisco RFE 0526 submitted and approved, PM action needed to link to related feature
**Urgency**: normal

---

## Key Points to Address

Confirm the PM team has opened Cisco RFE 0526 in Salesforce and linked it to the correct Related Feature. If unclear, ask which product area/feature should own regex-based allow/deny filtering for replication policies and who will be the PM owner.

## Draft Response

Hi Brian,  

We’ve opened Cisco RFE 0526 in Salesforce and are ready to link it to the correct Related Feature, but we need your guidance on which feature should own it. The request is clear: regex-based allow/deny patterns to filter files/objects by name in replication policies across Cisco’s global sites.  

Can you confirm which VAST product area you want this tied to in Salesforce—Replication Policies (DR/Replication), Multi-site/Global Namespace, or another specific feature you’re tracking? Also, who should be the PM owner on the Cisco side so we can keep the loop tight on requirements and acceptance criteria?  

If you reply with the intended Related Feature and owner by Wednesday, January 8, 2026, we’ll link the RFE the same day and post the record URL back to the thread.  

Thanks,  
Jason Vallery  
VP, Product Management – Cloud
