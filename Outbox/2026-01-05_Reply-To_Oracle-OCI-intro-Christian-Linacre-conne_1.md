Christian — thanks for the intro to Matt. Let’s lock in Thursday, 2025-12-11 from 1:30–2:30 PM Pacific Time in Seattle.

Lior Genzel will join me for the meeting. Appreciate you helping coordinate—if you can confirm location and timezone by EOD Friday, 2025-12-05, we’ll get the calendar invite finalized.
