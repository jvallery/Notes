# Draft Reply to Ray Coetzee

**Regarding**: Microsoft requests Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing, VAST declines due to readiness
**Urgency**: normal

---

## Key Points to Address

Align with Lior Genzel's position that VAST will not provide an Azure VoC instance for Microsoft GPU performance testing because VAST Azure is not ready; support Ray Coetzee in setting up a follow-up call with the Microsoft requestors; confirm whether Karl Vietmeier should provide any performance-profile expectations or whether the request is fully blocked.

## Draft Response

Hi Ray,

Thank you for your email. Here's my response:

- Align with Lior Genzel's position that VAST will not provide an Azure VoC instance for Microsoft GPU performance testing because VAST Azure is not ready; support Ray Coetzee in setting up a follow-up call with the Microsoft requestors; confirm whether Karl Vietmeier should provide any performance-profile expectations or whether the request is fully blocked.

To answer your questions:
- Should VAST entertain Microsoft's request for an Azure VoC instance to do performance testing against Azure GPU instances?: [TODO: Add answer]
- What performance profile is expected of the Azure VoC instance (as asked by Ray Coetzee to Karl Vietmeier)?: [TODO: Add answer]

I'll follow up on:
- Lior Genzel committed to communicating the refusal of Microsoft's Azure VoC request in his own way on a follow-up call.
- Ray Coetzee was asked to suggest a follow-up call with the Microsoft team who made the Azure VoC request.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Jason

## Original Summary

Ray Coetzee reported that Microsoft is testing a physical VAST PoC system in Microsoft's Redmond lab but lacks GPU nodes, so Microsoft requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU VMs. Lior Genzel directed Ray to schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft requestors and stated the answer will be no because VAST Azure is not ready for this use case.
