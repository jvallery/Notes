# Draft Reply to Ray Coetzee

**Regarding**: Microsoft requests Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing; VAST plans to decline
**Urgency**: normal

---

## Key Points to Address

Align with Lior Genzel's decision to decline the Azure VoC request, confirm next steps for the follow-up call with Microsoft requestors, and ensure Karl Vietmeier's performance-profile question is either answered with a clear statement or deferred pending readiness constraints.

## Draft Response

Hi Ray,  

We should decline Microsoft’s request for an Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing; VAST on Azure isn’t ready to support or stand behind that use case yet. Let’s keep the focus on the physical PoC in Redmond and set expectations clearly on the follow-up call.  

Next step: please schedule the follow-up with the Microsoft requestors for Wednesday, January 8, 2026 between 10:00–10:30am PT or Thursday, January 9, 2026 between 1:00–1:30pm PT, and include Lior and me. Lior will deliver the “no” on the VoC request on that call and align on what we can support in-lab (e.g., CPU-only validation, functional flows, and any data-path tests that don’t require Azure GPU VMs).  

On Karl’s performance-profile question: we should not provide a performance profile for an Azure VoC deployment for GPU benchmarking because we’re not in a position to commit to or validate those numbers today. I’ll sync with Karl and send you a crisp one-liner you can use externally by Friday, January 10, 2026 that explains we’re not offering Azure VoC for GPU perf testing until the Azure offering is production-ready for that workload.  

Thanks,

## Original Summary

Microsoft is testing a physical VAST PoC system in Microsoft's Redmond lab but lacks GPU nodes, so they requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU VMs. Lior Genzel directed Ray Coetzee to schedule a follow-up call with the Microsoft requestors and stated VAST will say no because VAST on Azure is not ready for this use case.
