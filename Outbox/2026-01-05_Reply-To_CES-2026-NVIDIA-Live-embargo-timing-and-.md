## Draft Response

Hi Renen,

Thank you for your email. Here's my response:

- Confirm whether Renen Hallak will arrive January 5, 2026 to attend NVIDIA Live; confirm acceptance of the Monday, December 29, 2025 review meeting with Gilad and a California team member; confirm owners for approving NVIDIA press release mentions and for creating Rubin-related VAST content; confirm plan to use John Mao for press interviews while Renen is with flash vendors; confirm next steps to coordinate a meeting with Microsoft EVP Jay Parikh in Las Vegas.

To answer your questions:
- Should Renen Hallak adjust travel to arrive in Las Vegas on January 5, 2026 to attend NVIDIA Live at 1:00pm PT?: [TODO: Add answer]
- Does Renen Hallak agree to a review meeting on Monday, December 29, 2025 with Gilad and a California team member working on Jensen's press conference presentation?: [TODO: Add answer]
- What additional aggressive actions should VAST take to increase media coverage and insert VAST into NVIDIA CES launch stories?: [TODO: Add answer]

I'll follow up on:
- Renen Hallak committed to meeting flash vendors during CES and stated he cannot change dates and has no time for interviews.
- Renen Hallak stated he is adding the Microsoft team to arrange a meeting with Jay Parikh.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Jason
