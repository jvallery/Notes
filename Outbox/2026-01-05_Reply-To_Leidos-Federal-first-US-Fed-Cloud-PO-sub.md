# Draft Reply to Jeff Denworth

**Regarding**: Leidos Federal first US Fed Cloud PO submitted (FOpp-4197) and request to track customer expectations
**Urgency**: normal

---

## Key Points to Address

Acknowledge Jeff Denworth's request to track the Leidos Federal cloud PO and confirm you will capture customer expectations, UX, cloud product implications, and BD learnings. Ask who should own confirming the SW-only scope versus any HW/upgrade component and whether you should sync with Greg Castellucci, Jennifer Azzolina, and Tiffany Stonehill to capture requirements for the GovCloud plus on-prem resilient demo (Golden Dome).

## Draft Response

Jeff — I’ll make FOpp-4197 (Leidos DoD Cloud) the first tracked US Fed Cloud PO and we’ll capture customer expectations, end-user experience, cloud product implications, and BD learnings end-to-end. I’ll also ensure we close the loop with OrderAdmin’s same-day booking SLA (docs complete before 3PM local) and flag any processing gaps immediately.

One clarification: can you confirm whether this order is strictly software-only as Greg described, or if there’s any hardware component/upgrade bundled (now or expected as a follow-on)? If you want me to own that confirmation, I’ll take it and report back with a definitive answer by EOD Wednesday, January 7.

Next steps: I’ll set up a 30-minute internal sync for Thursday, January 8 to align on what we need to learn from Leidos (success criteria, onboarding/UX friction, GovCloud constraints, security/compliance expectations, and expansion path). Unless you prefer otherwise, I’ll include Greg Castellucci, Jennifer Azzolina, and Tiffany Stonehill so we also capture requirements for the Leidos GovCloud deployment plus the on-prem resilient demo (Golden Dome).

## Original Summary

Jeff Denworth forwarded an internal OrderAdmin alert thread indicating a $96,808.14 software-only cloud deployment purchase order for Leidos Federal (FOpp-4197, "Leidos DoD Cloud") in a Leidos GovCloud instance, described as the first Cloud PO in the US Federal sector. Jeff Denworth asked Jason Vallery to ensure these deals are tracked to understand customer expectations, user experience, cloud implications, and business development angles.
