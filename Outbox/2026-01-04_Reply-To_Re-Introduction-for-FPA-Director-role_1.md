Hi Adem,

Thanks for introducing Edwin. It's great to make the connection. Edwin, welcome! I hope you're enjoying your time in London with Adem and Vanessa.

I've received your resume, and I'm looking forward to our conversation. Let's aim to schedule a call next week when you're back. I'll coordinate with my team to discuss any potential FP&A opportunities we might have in Colorado, and I'll get back to you with some available times for our call.

In the meantime, if you have any specific questions or additional information you'd like to share, feel free to reach out.

Best,  
Jason
