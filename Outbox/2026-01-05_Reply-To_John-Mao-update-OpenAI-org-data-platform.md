# Draft Reply to John Mao

**Regarding**: John Mao update: OpenAI org, data platforms (Rockset, Snowflake, CosmosDB, DAQ) and engineering relationship
**Urgency**: normal

---

## Key Points to Address

Thank John Mao for the detailed OpenAI context, confirm the engineering-centered approach, and provide a short prioritized list of specific questions for him to ask his OpenAI contact (Rockset architecture and scaling limits, CosmosDB usage patterns, DAQ storage and throughput requirements, and any concrete plans for merging Applications and Research datasets).

## Draft Response

Hi John,

Thank you for your email. Here's my response:

- Thank John Mao for the detailed OpenAI context, confirm the engineering-centered approach, and provide a short prioritized list of specific questions for him to ask his OpenAI contact (Rockset architecture and scaling limits, CosmosDB usage patterns, DAQ storage and throughput requirements, and any concrete plans for merging Applications and Research datasets).

To answer your questions:
- Has anyone at VAST previously evaluated Rockset in depth for fit or competitive positioning (as asked by John Mao)?: [TODO: Add answer]
- What specific information does VAST need from John Mao's OpenAI contact to advance an engineering-centered engagement with OpenAI?: [TODO: Add answer]

I'll follow up on:
- John Mao committed to flying to San Francisco early in the New Year to visit his OpenAI contact and open a dialogue to bring in VAST engineering.
- John Mao committed to asking his OpenAI contact for information that VAST needs and sharing what he can.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Jason

## Original Summary

John Mao shared details from a catch-up with a close personal friend who recently joined OpenAI to lead the Online Data Infrastructure engineering team in the Applications org. The email outlines OpenAI's org structure and key data platforms (Rockset, Snowflake, Azure CosmosDB, DAQ, and a separate Data Platform team), and John plans an early New Year SF visit to open an engineering-centered dialogue with OpenAI.
