## Draft Response

Hi Erika,

Thank you for your email. Here's my response:

- Thank Erika Smith for the confidential recap, confirm you will keep the Longmont church acquisition discussion confidential, ask for the current draft SWOT and the expected timing for the feasibility report-back, and ask how you can support the fundraising committee formation and Perla Delgado's staff-needs assessment.

To answer your questions:
- What specific fundraising support needs does IHDF have, and what staff capacity gaps did Perla Delgado identify?: [TODO: Add answer]
- What are the key strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats identified so far in the SWOT for the former church acquisition in Longmont?: [TODO: Add answer]
- When will the feasibility group (Maureen, Jorin, Tracy, and Perla Delgado) report back to the IHDF board?: [TODO: Add answer]

I'll follow up on:
- Erika Smith offered to provide more information about the IHDF executive session recap if asked.
- Perla Delgado will share the start of a SWOT document for the potential Longmont former church acquisition that Erika Smith co-created.
- Maureen, Jorin, Tracy, and Perla Delgado will look at initial feasibility of the potential Longmont former church acquisition and report back to the IHDF board.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Jason

## Original Summary

Erika Smith sent a confidential recap of an IHDF executive session that Jason Vallery missed. Key points were risks of taking public stances (tax-exempt status and donor/community impact), agreement to form a broader fundraising committee, and an early-stage exploration of acquiring a former church in Longmont with a small group to assess feasibility and report back to the board.
