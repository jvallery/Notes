# Draft Reply to Erika Smith

**Regarding**: IHDF executive session recap: public stances, fundraising committee, Longmont church acquisition exploration
**Urgency**: normal

---

## Key Points to Address

Thank Erika Smith for the recap, confirm confidentiality, ask for any specific decisions or actions needed from me, request the names/roles of Max, Shannon, Maureen, Jorin, and Tracy, and ask when the fundraising committee formation and the Longmont church feasibility update will be brought back to the board.

## Draft Response

Hi Erika,  

Thanks for the confidential exec session recap—very helpful, and I’ll keep it strictly within the board/executive context. Before I act on anything, can you confirm whether there were any specific decisions made or follow-ups you need from me (e.g., input on the public-stance guidance, fundraising committee charter/scope, or the Longmont exploration)?  

Also, can you share the full names and IHDF roles for Max, Shannon, Maureen, Jorin, and Tracy so I can track the right owners and stay aligned on accountability?  

On timing, when do you expect (1) the fundraising committee formation/charter and Perla’s staff-needs assessment to come back to the board, and (2) the first Longmont church feasibility update (including Perla’s initial SWOT and the small group’s recommendation) to be on a board agenda? If you don’t have dates yet, I’m happy to propose we target the next regular board meeting and set a specific checkpoint by Friday, January 17, 2026.  

Best,  
Jason Vallery

## Original Summary

Erika Smith sent a confidential recap of an IHDF executive session that I missed. Key points were risks of taking public stances (tax-exempt status and donor/community impact), agreement to form a broader fundraising committee, and an early-stage exploration of acquiring a former church in Longmont with a small group to assess feasibility and report back to the board.
