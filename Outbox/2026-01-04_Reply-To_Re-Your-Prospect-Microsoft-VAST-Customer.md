Thanks, Tiffany, for raising this. Given that Trevor Cooper-Chadwick is leading the tech evaluation for UK Met, his access to our Customer Learning Portal could facilitate a deeper understanding of VAST capabilities, which might be beneficial for the ongoing PoC. 

However, to maintain our standard access protocols, I recommend that we first clarify his specific objectives with Lior Genzel, who has insight into Trevor's role and requirements in this context. 

**Lior**, could you reach out to Trevor to determine his specific needs and ensure alignment with our access policies? Please update us on this by the end of the week so we can make a more informed decision.

**Kristin**, once we have more clarity from Lior, I suggest that we revisit the access request to align it with Trevor’s objectives and our strategic interests.

Let’s make sure we’re supporting Microsoft effectively while protecting our resources. 

Best, 
JV
