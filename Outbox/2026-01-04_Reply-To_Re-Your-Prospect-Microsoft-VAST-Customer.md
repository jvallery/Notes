Hi Tiffany,

Thank you for bringing me into the conversation. I agree with your inclination to maintain our current boundaries regarding access to the VAST Customer Learning Portal until we have more clarity on Trevor's objectives. It's crucial to ensure that our resources are reserved for those who are officially our customers or have a clear path to becoming one.

Lior, I appreciate your initiative in reaching out to Trevor. Please keep us updated on any insights you gather from your discussion with him. Once we have a better understanding of his intentions and any potential alignment with our customer criteria, we can make a more informed decision.

Kristin, let's hold off on granting any access until we have further confirmation. I will connect with our team to ensure that we are aligned on this process.

Thanks again, everyone. Let's keep each other informed as things develop.

Best,  
Jason
