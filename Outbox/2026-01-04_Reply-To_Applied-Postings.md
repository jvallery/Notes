Hello James,

Thanks for sharing the links to the positions you've applied for. I'll check my network to see if I have any second-degree connections at these companies and will let you know what I find. This may take a couple of days, but I'll make sure to get back to you with any helpful information.

In the meantime, I suggest reaching out directly to any first-degree connections you might have on LinkedIn who work at these companies. They might be able to provide insights or refer you internally, which can be quite beneficial.

If there's anything else you need or if you have updates on your end, feel free to reach out. I'll be in touch soon.

Best,  
Jason
