Hi James,

Thanks for reaching out and congratulations on taking the initiative with these applications! I’ll check my network to see if I have any 2nd degree connections at the companies you mentioned: NasDaq, Ibotta, DESRI, TRC Companies, Boost Mobile, and Prologis. I’ll get back to you with any potential connections by January 6th.

In the meantime, it might be helpful to reach out to your 1st degree connections on LinkedIn to see if they can introduce you to someone within these companies. This can sometimes uncover hidden opportunities.

Let me know if there's anything specific you need from me beyond this networking check.

Best,
JV
