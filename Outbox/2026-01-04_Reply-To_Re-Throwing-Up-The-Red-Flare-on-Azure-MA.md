Hi Jeff,

Thank you for outlining the urgency and the steps required to move forward with Microsoft. It’s clear that we need to act swiftly and decisively to secure this deal.

Jonsi and I will coordinate on the integration proposal for Azure Blob. We plan to finalize this promptly to ensure it supports our upcoming discussions. Additionally, I’ll follow up with Jonsi on the insights gathered from his communications with Microsoft contacts regarding their supply chain status.

We should expedite the organization of the engineering workshop in Redmond for early January. This will be critical in gathering momentum and solidifying our presence. I'll also touch base with Lior to ensure he’s prepared to lead the commercial discussions in Redmond as soon as possible.

Please let me know if there are other areas where I can provide assistance or if there are specific details you need us to address prior to these meetings.

Best,
Jason
