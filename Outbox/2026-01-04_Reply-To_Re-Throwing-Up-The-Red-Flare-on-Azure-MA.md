Hi Jeff,

Thanks for raising the urgency around Azure MAI. Aligning our approach to meet Microsoft's needs is critical given the supply chain challenges.

**Immediate Actions:**
- **Lior and Jonsi**: Please confirm your availability to be in Redmond the first week of January to initiate commercial discussions. This face-to-face engagement is crucial for influencing the storage decision early.
- **Supply Chain Intelligence**: Jonsi, continue pushing for updates from Microsoft contacts on their supply chain status. This will inform our strategic positioning.

**My Commitment:**
- I will collaborate with Lior on finalizing the Azure Blob integration proposal by tomorrow. This will enable us to frame the hardware and software discussions cohesively.

**Next Steps:**
- By the second week of January, we'll need to engage in detailed supply chain and build discussions. Let's ensure all stakeholders are aligned by then.
- We'll target a meeting between Renen and Scott G in the third week of January to secure philosophical alignment on the deal's scale.

Let me know if there are additional resources or support needed from my end.

Best, JV
