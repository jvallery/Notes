## Draft Response

Hi Rick,  

Thanks for the update on Cristina’s departure effective Friday, 2025-12-19, and for putting Stacy Wynn in place as interim RevOps lead. From the Cloud product side, we’ll align directly with Stacy on any near-term process changes that could impact forecasting, deal desk SLAs, or pricing/approval paths, and we’ll keep the field informed if anything changes.  

On the RevOps leadership search: I don’t yet have confirmation on the executive sponsor, hiring process, or timeline. I’ll check with you and the People team and send a concrete plan (sponsor, interview loop, and target dates) by Wednesday, 2026-01-07.  

In the meantime, if you want a single point of contact from Cloud Product for RevOps coordination, I’m happy to take that on and will set up a 30-minute sync with Stacy for the week of 2026-01-12 to confirm there’s no disruption to Q1 forecasting cadence or deal approvals.  

Best,  
Jason
