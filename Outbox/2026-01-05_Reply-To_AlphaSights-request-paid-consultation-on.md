## Draft Response

Hi Olivia,

Thanks for reaching out. I’m open to a paid consultation on corporate insider threat, with the caveat that I’ll keep the discussion at an industry and program-pattern level and won’t share any confidential or non-public information from VAST or prior employers.

I can cover the areas you outlined, including:
- Current trends and what is actually changing in insider risk
- Common operating models, which teams typically own what (Security, IT, HR, Legal, Compliance, Privacy)
- Governance patterns, controls, and metrics that work in practice
- Where the market is heading over the next 12-24 months

I’ll book time via your link for Tuesday, January 7, 2026 at 10:00 AM PT. If that slot is no longer available, my next best options are Tuesday, January 7 from 1:00-3:00 PM PT or Wednesday, January 8 from 9:00-11:00 AM PT.

Before we meet, can you please confirm the expected call length, the compensation rate, and whether the client is a vendor, investor, or end customer so I can tailor the level of detail appropriately?

Best regards,  
Jason Vallery  
VP, Product Management, Cloud
