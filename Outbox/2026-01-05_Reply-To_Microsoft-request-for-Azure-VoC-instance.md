# Draft Reply to Ray Coetzee

**Regarding**: Microsoft request for Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing (declined)
**Urgency**: normal

---

## Key Points to Address

Acknowledge Ray Coetzee's request for guidance on Microsoft's Azure VoC ask, align with Lior Genzel's decision to decline due to VAST Azure readiness, and support scheduling a follow-up call with the Microsoft requestors. Optionally ask Karl Vietmeier to provide a concise expected Azure VoC performance profile for internal alignment, even if the request is declined.

## Draft Response

Hi Ray,  

We should not entertain Microsoft’s request for an Azure VoC instance for GPU performance testing at this time—VAST Azure isn’t ready to support that use case, and we need to avoid setting expectations we can’t meet. This aligns with Lior’s decision to block the request, with him delivering the “no” on the follow-up call in his own way.  

I do support scheduling the follow-up call with the Microsoft requestors so we can explain the rationale clearly, capture their requirements, and agree on what “ready” looks like for a future engagement. If you can, please get that on the calendar by Wednesday, January 10, and include Lior plus the relevant Azure engineering contact on our side.  

Separately, it would still be useful to align internally on what we’d expect an Azure VoC performance profile to look like (even if we’re declining this specific ask). Karl—can you send Ray a concise view of expected throughput/latency and any key constraints for an Azure VoC instance by Friday, January 12?  

Thanks,

## Original Summary

Microsoft requested an Azure VoC instance to run performance testing against Azure GPU VMs because their Redmond lab currently lacks GPU nodes. Lior Genzel directed the team to schedule a follow-up call with Microsoft but to decline the request because VAST Azure is not ready for this use case.
