Hi Lior,

Thanks for looping me in on this. I'll address the points where I can provide clarity:

For the FIPS compliance question raised by Kamal, our solution is designed to meet FIPS 140-2 standards. We have integrated cryptographic modules that are validated for this compliance. If further details are needed, I can arrange a detailed technical session to walk through our compliance documentation.

Regarding the use of Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs) in our proposal, the SSDs included in our pricing do utilize SEDs. This ensures that data remains secure and aligns with industry best practices for data protection.

On the topic of hardware partnerships, we indeed work with several preferred partners. As Lior mentioned, Cisco, Dell, and HPE are among our certified partners. I will coordinate with our partners group to get the full list and send it over for your evaluation.

Let me know if there's anything further you need, or if we should set aside time for a deeper discussion on any of these points.

Best,
Jason
