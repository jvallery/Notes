Hi Jeff,

Thanks for the detailed update and the urgent push on the Azure MAI deal. I completely agree with your assessment on the need for rapid action given the supply chain challenges and Microsoft's tight timelines.

Jonsi and I will be syncing up on the integration proposal for Azure Blob, and I'll ensure we have a solid plan to present at the engineering workshop in Redmond in January. This aligns with our prior discussions on the Azure engagement strategy, and I believe it will reinforce our value proposition.

I'll coordinate with Lior to get the latest on the supply chain intel. He's been pivotal in driving our cloud strategy and has recent insights from our engineering team about the Global Namespace on Azure. We will ensure he or Jonsi can be in Redmond to spearhead the commercial discussions as soon as the new year kicks off.

Let me know if there's anything specific you need from my end to facilitate these efforts. I’m keen to see this through successfully.

Best,  
Jason
