## Draft Response

Hi Stacy,  

Thanks for sharing the 2025-12-23 Pricing Changes and Supply Chain Update recording and the FAQ (passcode included). I’ve reviewed the materials and appreciate the heads-up that the situation is moving quickly.  

To make this actionable, I’m going to have our team map the guidance to our current pipeline and flag any deals where pricing validity, lead times, or supply constraints could change the close plan. If you can confirm whether there are any specific SKUs/configurations currently constrained (or any effective-date cutoffs we should treat as hard lines), that will help us prioritize the right conversations.  

If it’s helpful, I’ll send you a short list of the active deals we think are most exposed by Friday, 2026-01-09, and we can pull in Erik or Rick for a 20-minute review to keep everything moving.  

Best,  
Jason Vallery
