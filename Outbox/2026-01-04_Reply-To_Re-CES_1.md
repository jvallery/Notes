# Draft Reply: Re: CES

Hi Renen,

Thank you for looping me into the CES preparations. Given the tight schedule, I understand the constraints around the flash vendor meetings. It's great that you're coordinating with the Microsoft team to arrange a meeting with Jay Parikh, which aligns well with our ongoing efforts to strengthen our partnership with Microsoft, especially with the momentum we've been building around Azure initiatives.

Regarding the NVIDIA Live event, I appreciate the detailed rundown from Kirstin. Since our goal is to position VAST prominently in NVIDIA's announcements, I'll ensure our team is aligned on the content approvals and the blog post Sagi and Lior Cohen are working on for the Open Models press release. This should enhance our visibility during the event, and I'll check with Jeff for the BF4 blog approval to keep our timeline on track.

Please let me know if there's anything specific you need from me as we finalize plans for CES, or if there are other areas where you think we should focus more aggressively.

Best,  
Jason
