## Draft Response

Hi Jonsi,  

Thanks for sharing the “GCP Flow from customer to sales to customer” deck. I’ll review it and add any edits/comments by Wednesday, January 8, 2026.  

If there are specific sections you want me to focus on (handoffs, ownership, or timing), reply with the top 2–3 priorities and I’ll make sure those are covered.  

Best,
