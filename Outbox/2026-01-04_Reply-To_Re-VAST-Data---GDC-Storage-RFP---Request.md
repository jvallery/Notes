Hi David,

Thank you for the follow-up and for including me in this conversation. I'll address your questions below:

1. **FIPS Compliance**: Our solution is designed with security in mind and aligns with various compliance standards, including FIPS. Our software is engineered to support FIPS-compliant environments, and I can arrange a deeper technical session with our security team to provide a detailed overview if needed.

2. **Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs)**: Regarding your question on SEDs, I believe our SSD components do include self-encryption capabilities. However, I'll confirm this with our engineering team and get back to you with a definitive answer shortly.

3. **BYOH Preferred Partners**: As Lior mentioned, we can collaborate with Google to certify a preferred hardware partner given the scale of this project. We already have partnerships with industry leaders like CISCO, Dell, HPE, and SuperMicro. I'll gather a comprehensive list of our global certified partners and share it with you.

Please let me know if there's a preferred time for a meeting this week to discuss these points further. I can adjust my schedule to ensure we can address all your questions effectively.

Best,  
Jason
