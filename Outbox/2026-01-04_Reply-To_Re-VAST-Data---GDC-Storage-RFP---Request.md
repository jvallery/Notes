Hi David and Lior,

Thanks for including me in this important discussion. I’m happy to clarify the points raised regarding our proposal for the Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) RFP.

**FIPS Compliance**: Our offering meets FIPS compliance standards through a combination of hardware and software measures. We leverage software-based encryption that is FIPS 140-2 certified to ensure data security and compliance.

**Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs)**: Regarding the inclusion of Self-Encrypting Drives, I can confirm that while our current hardware proposal includes SSDs, they are not configured as SEDs. Instead, we utilize a robust software encryption solution that aligns with FIPS compliance requirements.

**Hardware Partnerships**: For the BYOH option, we can indeed work with Google to certify a preferred hardware partner. Currently, our certified partners include Cisco, Dell, HPE, and SuperMicro. I will coordinate with our partners group to provide a comprehensive list of certified global partners.

**Next Steps**: To proceed, I suggest scheduling a follow-up call to ensure we align on all technical and compliance aspects of the proposal. Could you confirm your availability for a meeting on December 18th at either 9:30 AM or 3 PM PT? Alternatively, please propose a time that works best for you.

Please let me know if you need any more information or further clarification on these points.

Best,
Jason Vallery
