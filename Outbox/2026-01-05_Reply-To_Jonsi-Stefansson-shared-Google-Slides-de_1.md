## Draft Response

Hi Jonsi,  

Thanks for sharing the “GCP Flow from customer to sales to customer” deck and adding me as an editor. I’ll review it and send you consolidated feedback by Wednesday, January 8, 2026 EOD PT.  

If there are any specific sections you want me to focus on (e.g., handoffs, ownership, or customer touchpoints), reply with the top 2–3 and I’ll prioritize those.  

Best,  
Jason Vallery
