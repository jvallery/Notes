## Draft Response

Hi Peter,

Yes — Sebastien’s calendar invite for Thursday, January 7, 2026 at 8:00am in Lafayette works for me, and I’ve accepted it. I’ll be there a few minutes early and will follow the location details in the invite.

Thanks again for the intro to Sebastien — I appreciate you making the connection.

Best,
