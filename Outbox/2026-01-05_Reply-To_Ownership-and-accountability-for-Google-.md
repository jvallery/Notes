# Draft Reply to Karl Vietmeier

**Regarding**: Ownership and accountability for Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local support opportunities
**Urgency**: normal

---

## Key Points to Address

Respond to Karl Vietmeier with a clear ownership model for Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Microsoft Azure Local opportunities, including whether Cloud Product Management owns end-to-end execution, how to engage on-prem/hardware teams without losing accountability, and what level of control and reporting cadence Jason Vallery expects.

## Draft Response

Karl — Cloud Product Management owns GDC and Azure Local opportunities end-to-end from intake through GA, even when the deal motion shifts on-prem once hardware enters. We’ll pull on-prem/hardware teams in as accountable execution partners, but Cloud PM remains the single-threaded owner for scope, timeline, external commitments, and status.

Operationally: Cloud PM is the DRI and runs a single plan-of-record for each opportunity (requirements, target architecture, validation plan, dependencies, and customer/partner milestones). On-prem/hardware owns the hardware BOM/qualification, sizing, supply-chain/lead times, and any rack/stack or field enablement deliverables; Support/Services owns runbooks and escalation paths; Sales/SE owns customer comms—each with named owners and dates, but Cloud PM is accountable for the integrated outcome and for preventing “handoff gaps.”

On control and cadence: I want Cloud PM to be assertive—no opportunity should move forward without Cloud PM sign-off on feasibility and a committed validation plan. Starting next Monday, January 12, 2026, let’s run a 30-minute weekly GDC/Azure Local pipeline + execution review with you, me, and the on-prem/hardware lead; we’ll maintain a shared tracker with RAG status, next milestones, and blockers, updated by 5:00pm PT every Friday.

If you send me the current list of inbound GDC/Azure Local asks (customer/partner, stage, and what they’re requesting), I’ll confirm the initial DRIs and we’ll stand up the tracker by Wednesday, January 7, 2026.

## Original Summary

Karl Vietmeier flagged growing inbound interest in whether VAST supports Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Microsoft Azure Local. He noted that these start as cloud opportunities but shift to on-prem ownership once hardware is involved, creating accountability confusion and reducing visibility into progress. Karl asked Jason Vallery for guidance on how strongly Cloud Product Management should assert ownership and control for these opportunities.
