**Urgency**: urgent

## Key Points to Address

Acknowledge receipt, confirm you will review the Cloud Course and Project Brief, and commit to providing feedback by 2026-01-07. Ask where the documents are hosted and whether there are specific sections (messaging vs technical) you should prioritize for the January working session.

## Draft Response

Hi Terika,  

I’ll review both the VAST on Cloud course draft and the project brief and will send you consolidated feedback by end of day Tuesday, 2026-01-07. I’ll focus on field clarity, alignment to our Cloud narrative, and technical accuracy so you can incorporate updates ahead of the January working session.  

Can you point me to where the documents are hosted (SharePoint, Google Docs, etc.) and confirm who has edit/comment access? If you want me to prioritize specific sections for the working session—messaging/positioning vs. technical architecture, deployment flows, and prerequisites—tell me which ones and I’ll start there.  

Thanks,  
Jason Vallery  
VP, Product Management – Cloud
