# Draft Reply to Tiffany Stonehill

**Regarding**: Microsoft prospect requests VAST Customer Learning Portal access (Trevor Cooper-Chadwick)
**Urgency**: normal

---

## Key Points to Address

Confirm whether Trevor Cooper-Chadwick (Microsoft) should receive VAST Customer Learning Portal access while Microsoft is still in an engineering-level PoC (UK Met). Align with Tiffany Stonehill's boundary recommendation and incorporate Lior Genzel's findings after he contacts Trevor. Instruct Kristin Thompson whether to approve or keep pending.

## Draft Response

Hi Tiffany,  

We should not grant Trevor Cooper-Chadwick (trcooper@microsoft.com) access to the VAST Customer Learning Portal while Microsoft is still in an engineering-level PoC for UK Met and not yet a customer. Let’s keep the request pending until Lior confirms the specific objective and we can decide the right, scoped enablement path.  

This aligns with the boundary you recommended: the Customer Learning Portal is customer-facing material, and opening it up broadly during a PoC creates unnecessary IP and entitlement risk. If Trevor’s need is legitimate for the PoC, we can satisfy it with targeted assets (e.g., specific docs, a short enablement session, or a limited PoC package) rather than full portal access.  

Kristin—please hold approval for now and do not provision access. Lior is reaching out to Trevor; once Lior reports back, I’ll confirm the decision and, if needed, we’ll provide a scoped alternative by Wednesday, January 8, 2026.  

Thanks,

## Original Summary

Kristin Thompson asked Tiffany Stonehill to verify whether Microsoft prospect Trevor Cooper-Chadwick should be granted access to the VAST Customer Learning Portal. Tiffany recommended not granting access yet and deferred to senior execs, while Lior Genzel committed to contact Trevor to understand his objectives because Microsoft is in an engineering-level PoC (UK Met) and not yet a customer.
