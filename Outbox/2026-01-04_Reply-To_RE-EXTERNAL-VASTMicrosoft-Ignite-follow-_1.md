Hi Sushant,

Nice to meet you too! I'd be happy to set up a call to discuss our technical collaboration further. Given our recent discussions in San Francisco and the ongoing work integrating VAST Data's capabilities with Microsoft Azure, I believe a call will be highly beneficial.

Could we target a time next week? I'm flexible on Monday or Tuesday afternoon, so please let me know what works best on your end. In the meantime, I'll ensure you have the architecture documents we discussed so you can review them before our call.

Looking forward to our conversation.

Best,  
Jason
