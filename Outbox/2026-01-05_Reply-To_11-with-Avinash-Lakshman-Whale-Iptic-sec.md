# Draft Reply to Meeting Summary with AI Companion

**Regarding**: 1:1 with Avinash Lakshman, Whale Iptic secure compute platform and potential VAST integration
**Urgency**: normal

---

## Key Points to Address

Send Avinash Lakshman a follow-up email with public VAST Data links and a concise overview of current capabilities and near-term direction relevant to: enterprise storage for AI training and model distribution, hybrid and multi-cloud deployments, GPU cloud and neocloud enablement, and any public materials related to secure and auditable agent execution concepts. Ask Avinash to share a concrete integration proposal or architecture sketch for how Whale Iptic's Cerebrum/Icarus and distributed ledger could interface with VAST.

## Draft Response

Hi Meeting,

Thank you for your email. Here's my response:

- Send Avinash Lakshman a follow-up email with public VAST Data links and a concise overview of current capabilities and near-term direction relevant to: enterprise storage for AI training and model distribution, hybrid and multi-cloud deployments, GPU cloud and neocloud enablement, and any public materials related to secure and auditable agent execution concepts
- Ask Avinash to share a concrete integration proposal or architecture sketch for how Whale Iptic's Cerebrum/Icarus and distributed ledger could interface with VAST.

To answer your questions:
- What specific VAST Data capabilities and public materials should be shared with Avinash Lakshman to evaluate integration with Whale Iptic's secure compute platform and distributed ledger approach?: [TODO: Add answer]
- Is a browser-based identity agent required for Whale Iptic's security model, and what are the integration implications for enterprise deployments that cannot rely on browser agents?: [TODO: Add answer]

I'll follow up on:
- Jason Vallery agreed to email Avinash Lakshman public information and links about VAST Data's current and upcoming capabilities.
- Avinash Lakshman agreed to review the information and potentially follow up with integration ideas or proposals.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Jason

## Original Summary

On 2025-12-17, Jason Vallery and Avinash Lakshman discussed Whale Iptic's globally distributed secure compute platform for AI agents and Web2 applications, including Icarus and the Cerebrum SDK. They explored potential integration areas with VAST Data storage, GPU infrastructure across neoclouds, and distributed ledger technology for secure, verifiable agent execution. Jason committed to sending Avinash public links and information about VAST's current and upcoming capabilities for follow-up.
