Hi Sushant,

It's great to meet you, albeit virtually for now. I'd be happy to set up a call to discuss our technical collaboration further. How about we schedule a meeting for next Tuesday or Wednesday? Please let me know your availability, and I'll do my best to accommodate.

Regarding the architecture documents you mentioned, I'll check on their status and ensure they are shared with you as soon as possible so you can prepare accordingly.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best,  
Jason
