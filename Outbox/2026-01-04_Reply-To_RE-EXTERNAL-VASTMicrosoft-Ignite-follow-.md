Hi Sushant,

Thanks for reaching out and for your interest in collaborating on our cloud initiatives. I'm eager to discuss the architecture documents and explore how we can enhance our technical collaboration.

Let's schedule a time for our introductory call. How does Tuesday, December 15th at 10 AM MT or 2 PM MT work for you? Alternatively, if there's another time that suits you better, please let me know.

In preparation for our call, I'll ensure the architecture documents discussed in San Francisco are shared with you by the end of this week. This will give you some time to review them before our meeting.

Looking forward to our conversation.

Best,
Jason Vallery
