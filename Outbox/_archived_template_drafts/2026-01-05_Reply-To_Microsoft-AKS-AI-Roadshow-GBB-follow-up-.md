# Draft Reply to Tiffany Stonehill

**Regarding**: Microsoft AKS AI Roadshow (GBB) follow-up: share slides/code, pipeline sync, Global Namespace on Azure demo
**Urgency**: normal

---

## Key Points to Address

Confirm we will send the slides and code/access artifacts from the AKS AI Roadshow session, propose specific January 2026 times for a pipeline sync (accounting for Mohamad Al Jazaery being out for two weeks), and route the Global Namespace on Azure demo/accelerator question to Lior Genzel for engineering status and next steps.

## Draft Response

Hi Tiffany,

Thank you for your email. Here's my response:

- Confirm we will send the slides and code/access artifacts from the AKS AI Roadshow session, propose specific January 2026 times for a pipeline sync (accounting for Mohamad Al Jazaery being out for two weeks), and route the Global Namespace on Azure demo/accelerator question to Lior Genzel for engineering status and next steps.

To answer your questions:
- What day and time in January 2026 works for a pipeline sync between Microsoft (Mohamad Al Jazaery, Kurt Niebuhr) and VAST (Tiffany Stonehill) to review and expand the Azure customer list?: [TODO: Add answer]
- Is there a plan and timeline to build a demo/accelerator that showcases VAST Global Namespace on Microsoft Azure for inclusion in the AKS AI Roadshow, and what is the current engineering status?: [TODO: Add answer]

I'll follow up on:
- Tiffany Stonehill committed to coordinate with Jason Vallery to get the AKS AI Roadshow slides and access sent to Microsoft.
- Mohamad Al Jazaery committed to reconnect in January 2026 because he will be out for the next two weeks starting 2025-12-19.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Jason

## Original Summary

After VAST presented VAST + AKS to Microsoft Global Black Belt (GBB) AI infrastructure sellers, Microsoft requested the slides and code, a pipeline sync with Tiffany Stonehill, and a plan for a Global Namespace on Azure demo/accelerator for the AI roadshow. Tiffany committed to coordinate with Jason Vallery to send slides/access and deferred Global Namespace on Azure details to Lior Genzel. Mohamad Al Jazaery will be out for two weeks and asked to reconnect in January.
