## Draft Response

Hi Tiffany,

Thank you for your email. Here's my response:

- Confirm decision path for granting VAST Customer Learning Portal access to Microsoft prospect Trevor Cooper-Chadwick
- Align with Lior Genzel after he contacts Trevor to understand objectives, then instruct Kristin Thompson whether to approve or keep access blocked during the UK Met engineering-level PoC.

To answer your questions:
- Should Microsoft prospect Trevor Cooper-Chadwick be granted access to the VAST Customer Learning Portal materials during the UK Met engineering-level PoC?: [TODO: Add answer]

I'll follow up on:
- Lior Genzel committed to reach out to Trevor Cooper-Chadwick to learn his objectives for requesting VAST Customer Learning Portal access.
- Kristin Thompson committed to keep Trevor Cooper-Chadwick's access request as 'pending approval' until she hears back from Lior Genzel.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Jason

## Original Summary

Kristin Thompson asked Tiffany Stonehill to approve VAST Customer Learning Portal access for Microsoft prospect Trevor Cooper-Chadwick (trcooper@microsoft.com). Tiffany recommended not granting access yet and deferred to senior execs, while Lior Genzel committed to contact Trevor to understand objectives because Microsoft is in an engineering-level PoC (UK Met) and not yet a customer.
