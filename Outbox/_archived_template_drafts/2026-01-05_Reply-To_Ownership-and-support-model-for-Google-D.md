## Draft Response

Hi Karl,

Thank you for your email. Here's my response:

- Respond to Karl Vietmeier with a clear ownership model for Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Microsoft Azure Local opportunities, including how Cloud Product Management will engage when hardware is involved, how accountability will be tracked, and what level of control Jason Vallery wants to retain versus handing off to on-prem teams.

To answer your questions:
- How aggressive should Cloud Product Management be in asserting ownership of Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Microsoft Azure Local opportunities when hardware is involved?: [TODO: Add answer]
- How much control does Jason Vallery want to maintain over GDC and Azure Local opportunities versus handing ownership to on-prem teams?: [TODO: Add answer]

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Jason

## Original Summary

Karl Vietmeier flagged growing market interest in VAST support for Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Microsoft Azure Local. He noted that when hardware is involved, on-prem teams tend to take ownership, which creates accountability confusion and reduces cloud team visibility. Karl asked Jason Vallery for guidance on how strongly Cloud Product Management should assert ownership and control for these opportunities.
