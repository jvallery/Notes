# Draft Reply to Karl Vietmeier

**Regarding**: Karl Vietmeier asks for guidance on ownership of GDC and Azure Local opportunities
**Urgency**: normal

---

## Key Points to Address

Provide a clear ownership stance for GDC and Azure Local opportunities (cloud product management vs on-prem teams), define accountability boundaries when hardware is involved, and outline next steps for an internal operating model to preserve visibility and execution alignment with hyperscaler initiatives.

## Draft Response

Hi Karl,

Thank you for your email. Here's my response:

- Provide a clear ownership stance for GDC and Azure Local opportunities (cloud product management vs on-prem teams), define accountability boundaries when hardware is involved, and outline next steps for an internal operating model to preserve visibility and execution alignment with hyperscaler initiatives.

To answer your questions:
- How aggressively should VAST cloud product management assert ownership of Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local opportunities when on-prem teams take over once hardware is involved?: [TODO: Add answer]
- How much control does Jason Vallery want cloud product management to maintain over GDC and Azure Local opportunities versus sharing ownership with on-prem teams?: [TODO: Add answer]

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Jason

## Original Summary

Karl Vietmeier reports growing interest in whether VAST supports Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and Azure Local, and notes internal confusion when on-prem teams take ownership once hardware is involved. He recommends cloud product management own these opportunities due to hyperscaler relationships and cloud-consumption acquisition paths, and asks Jason Vallery how aggressively to assert ownership and control.
