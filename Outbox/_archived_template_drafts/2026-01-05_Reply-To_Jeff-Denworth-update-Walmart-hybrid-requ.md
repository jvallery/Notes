# Draft Reply to Jeff Denworth

**Regarding**: Jeff Denworth update: Walmart hybrid requirements unsettled, need analysis and product plan input
**Urgency**: normal

---

## Key Points to Address

Acknowledge Jeff Denworth's update, confirm PM management will drive the Walmart requirements analysis, ask for any notes/artifacts from Walmart's internal requirements meeting, and propose a working session with Mikey and the Walmart account team to translate requirements into product plan inputs and a competitive response to Alluxio.

---

## Draft Response

Jeff — understood on the restated Walmart direction: they want a durable hybrid architecture with a single namespace, they won’t accept two disjoint namespaces, and they’re proceeding with an on‑prem‑only big data POC while requiring GCS integration. Product Management will own the requirements analysis and turn it into a concrete product plan and competitive response (including how we neutralize Alluxio) with clear milestones.

Can you forward any notes/artifacts from Walmart’s internal requirements meeting (slides, email recap, decision log), and confirm what additional requirements were restated beyond: long‑term hybrid, unified namespace, on‑prem‑only POC, and GCS integration? Also, what’s the current status of Alluxio at Walmart (incumbent vs. short‑listed vs. already deployed), and which specific capabilities are driving the perception that they’re leading (e.g., GCS interoperability patterns, caching semantics, namespace federation, security/identity, governance, performance at scale)?

Let’s run a 60‑minute working session with you, Mikey, and the Walmart account team to translate requirements into product plan inputs and an execution path to full‑estate takeover. I can do Tuesday, Jan 7 at 11:00–12:00 PT or Wednesday, Jan 8 at 1:00–2:00 PT—tell me which works, and please confirm Mikey’s full name/role and who else from the account team should be in the room (SE, SA, partner lead, and anyone owning the POC).

## Original Summary

Jeff Denworth shared that Walmart restated requirements after an internal meeting, emphasizing a long-term hybrid solution and rejection of two disjoint namespaces. Walmart plans an on-prem-only big data POC and requires integration with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), which may put Alluxio back in a leading position. Jeff asked PM management to analyze requirements with Mikey and team and drive a product plan path toward full estate takeover.
