## Draft Response

Hi Jeff,

Thank you for your email. Here's my response:

- Acknowledge Jeff Denworth's supply chain concern, answer whether Microsoft MAI expects to use VAST Data supply chain, state current inventory reality (nothing reserved), propose immediate next steps to build a deployment plan for April-June 2026 including ordering timeline for 2 EB, and confirm the scheduled discussion 'tomorrow' with a concrete time if possible.

To answer your questions:
- Does Microsoft MAI expect to use VAST Data's supply chain for any part of the deployment, or will Microsoft source hardware and flash independently?: [TODO: Add answer]
- If Microsoft MAI wants deployments in April 2026 through June 2026, what inventory and lead times can VAST Data realistically commit to given constrained supply chain?: [TODO: Add answer]
- How will VAST Data source and fulfill the Microsoft MAI capacity requirement (2 EB mentioned), and when must purchase orders be placed?: [TODO: Add answer]

I'll follow up on:
- Jeff Denworth stated, 'We will talk tomorrow,' indicating a planned discussion the next day relative to 2025-12-21.
- Lior Genzel committed to sharing a detailed end-of-day summary of status (relative to 2025-12-12).
- Lior Genzel committed to sending an end-of-day or end-of-week summary later on 2025-12-12 incorporating Jason Vallery's feedback.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Jason

## Original Summary

Jeff Denworth raised urgent concerns about whether Microsoft MAI expects to use VAST's supply chain, noting VAST is selling out inventory and lead times are increasing. He emphasized that if Microsoft wants deployments in April through June 2026, VAST needs a plan immediately because nothing is reserved for Microsoft.
