## Key Points to Address

Reply to David Pawlak (Google) with: (1) FIPS compliance explanation for the proposed VAST offering, (2) confirmation that recurring pricing includes hardware and SSDs and that VAST does not sell HDDs, (3) explicit answer on whether SSDs are Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs), and (4) BYOH partner approach including existing certified eBox partners (Cisco, Dell, HPE, Supermicro) and ODM partners (Arrow, Avnet), plus plan/timeline to provide the full global certified partner list. Also propose specific times for the requested follow-up meeting to review Google's document, noting Lior is mostly off Friday and suggesting Monday as an alternative if Friday is not feasible.

## Draft Response

Hi Lior,

Thank you for your email. Here's my response:

- Reply to David Pawlak (Google) with: (1) FIPS compliance explanation for the proposed VAST offering, (2) confirmation that recurring pricing includes hardware and SSDs and that VAST does not sell HDDs, (3) explicit answer on whether SSDs are Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs), and (4) BYOH partner approach including existing certified eBox partners (Cisco, Dell, HPE, Supermicro) and ODM partners (Arrow, Avnet), plus plan/timeline to provide the full global certified partner list
- Also propose specific times for the requested follow-up meeting to review Google's document, noting Lior is mostly off Friday and suggesting Monday as an alternative if Friday is not feasible.

To answer your questions:
- How does VAST Data's proposed offering for the Google GDC Storage RFP meet FIPS compliance standards raised by Kamal Vyas?: [TODO: Add answer]
- Does the proposed recurring pricing for the Google GDC Storage RFP include hardware (HDDs/SSDs), and if it includes SSDs, are they Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs)?: [TODO: Add answer]
- If Google chooses BYOH for the Google GDC Storage RFP, what preferred industry hardware partners can VAST Data work with, and can VAST certify a Google-preferred hardware partner?: [TODO: Add answer]

I'll follow up on:
- Lior Genzel committed to check with VAST Data partner organization for the full list of globally certified hardware partners and share it with Google.
- Lior Genzel stated Jason Vallery will take the lead on answering the Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs) question for the Google GDC Storage RFP follow-up.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Jason

## Original Summary

Google (David Pawlak) requested follow-up clarifications on VAST Data's Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) Storage RFP proposal, including FIPS compliance, whether recurring pricing includes hardware and SSDs, whether SSDs are Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs), and BYOH partner options. Lior Genzel looped in Jason Vallery to lead the SEDs response and noted VAST can certify a Google-preferred hardware partner; Google also requested an additional meeting to walk VAST through a document.
