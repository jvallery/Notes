## Draft Response

Hi Kirstin,  

Thanks for looping me in and for the clear prep cadence. I’m aligned with the Jan 6 intro call and the full run-up through VAST Forward on Feb 25–26, and I don’t anticipate any conflicts with the spokesperson role.  

One quick question: in the linked breakout sessions document, which specific breakout session(s) and spokesperson role assignment are mine? I want to make sure I’m tracking the right customer pairing and prep schedule before we lock the 1:1s and customer sessions the week of January 6.  

Appreciate you sending the session template ahead of the January 6 call—once I have my session assignment, I’ll come to the intro with an initial outline and proposed narrative arc.  

Best,  
Jason Vallery
