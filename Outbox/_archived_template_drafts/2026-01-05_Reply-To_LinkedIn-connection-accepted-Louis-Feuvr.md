## Draft Response

Hi Louis,  

Thanks for connecting on LinkedIn. What are you focused on right now—any initiatives around AI infrastructure, data platforms, or cloud modernization that you’re driving this quarter?  

If it’s helpful, I’m happy to share what we’re seeing across customers building GPU-heavy pipelines on a unified data platform and compare notes. If you’re open to it, send me a couple times that work for a quick 15-minute chat next week and I’ll lock something in.  

Best,  
Jason Vallery  
VP, Product Management – Cloud
