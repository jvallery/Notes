## Draft Response

Hi Lior,

Thank you for your email. Here's my response:

- Propose a few specific meeting times for an intro call with Sushant Rewaskar (Microsoft), confirm the meeting platform (Microsoft Teams), and align with Lior Genzel on which VAST architecture documents from the San Francisco discussion can be shared externally.

To answer your questions:
- Which specific VAST architecture documents from the San Francisco discussion should be shared with Sushant Rewaskar (Microsoft)?: [TODO: Add answer]
- What meeting times does Jason Vallery prefer for the intro call with Sushant Rewaskar (Microsoft)?: [TODO: Add answer]

I'll follow up on:
- Lior Genzel (VAST Data) committed to setting up a follow-up meeting over Microsoft Teams with VAST's VP of Product Management for Cloud if an in-person meeting could not happen.
- Lior Genzel (VAST Data) committed to updating Sushant Rewaskar (Microsoft) once he had a confirmed schedule for the next day during the Seattle visit.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Jason
