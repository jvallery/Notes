# Draft Reply to Brian Evans

**Regarding**: Cisco RFE 0526: Regex-based allow/deny patterns for replication policies
**Urgency**: normal

## Key Points to Address

Confirm the PM team has opened Salesforce RFE 0526 and linked it to the correct Related Feature; ask Jeff Mohler (Sales Engineer) for any additional detail on required pattern syntax (glob vs regex), scope (file vs object), and where in the replication policy UI/API the filters should apply.

## Draft Response

Hi Brian,

Thank you for your email. Here's my response:

- Confirm the PM team has opened Salesforce RFE 0526 and linked it to the correct Related Feature; ask Jeff Mohler (Sales Engineer) for any additional detail on required pattern syntax (glob vs regex), scope (file vs object), and where in the replication policy UI/API the filters should apply.

To answer your questions:
- Which VAST product feature (Related Feature in Salesforce) should RFE 0526 be linked to for replication policy filtering by name/regex?: [TODO: Add answer]

I'll follow up on:
- Brian Evans stated that RFE 0526 was approved by Brian Evans.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Jason
