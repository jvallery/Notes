Hi John,

Thanks for sharing the detailed insights from your conversation with your friend at OpenAI. It's intriguing to hear about the organizational structure and their use of Rockset and Snowflake. I appreciate the opportunity you've identified for us to potentially engage more deeply with their engineering team.

Regarding your question about Rockset, I'll check internally to see if we've explored it in depth before, but I don't recall any comprehensive evaluations offhand. Given the context you’ve provided, it might be worth looking into further, especially considering its role as a vector database for OpenAI.

Your upcoming trip to San Francisco sounds like a great opportunity to strengthen this relationship. Please keep me in the loop on any specific questions or areas where you think we could provide value. I’d also be interested in any feedback on our Database pitch, as it could help refine our approach.

Let’s coordinate closer to your trip to ensure we're aligned on the key points and potential collaboration avenues.

Best,  
Jason
