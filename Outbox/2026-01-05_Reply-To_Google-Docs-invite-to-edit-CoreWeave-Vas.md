## Draft Response

Hi Mordechai,  

Thanks for sharing the “CoreWeave-Vast Automation Project - V2” doc and granting edit access. I’ve got it and can review this week—what specific feedback or edits do you want from me (e.g., scope/requirements, architecture, milestones/owners, or open questions/risks)?  

If you point me to the sections you care about most, I’ll turn comments/edits around by Thursday, January 9, 2026 EOD PT. If there’s a tighter deadline, tell me the date/time and I’ll prioritize accordingly.  

Best,  
Jason Vallery
