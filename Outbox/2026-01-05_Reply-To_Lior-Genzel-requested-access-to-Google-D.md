## Draft Response

Hi Lior,  

I’ve granted you access to “VAST and Azure Integration.docx” in Google Drive. You should be able to open it now with your VAST email—if you still see an access prompt, forward me the address you’re using and I’ll fix it today.  

If you have specific sections you want reviewed (e.g., auth, networking, or deployment flow), reply with the areas and I’ll take a pass by Wednesday, 2026-01-07.  

Thanks,  
Jason Vallery
