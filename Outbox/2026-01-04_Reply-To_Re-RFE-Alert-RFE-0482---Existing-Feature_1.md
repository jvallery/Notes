Hello Brian,

Thank you for bringing this RFE to our attention. The request for enhanced visibility for NVIDIA's DGX Cloud clusters is indeed crucial, and I appreciate the detailed breakdown provided. This aligns with our ongoing efforts to deepen VAST's strategic partnership with NVIDIA.

I see that Chuck Cancilla is the Sales Engineer involved, and I'll ensure our team collaborates closely with him to address the requirements effectively. Given the significance of this enhancement to our relationship with NVIDIA and the considerable value proposition, I'll prioritize this within our product management discussions.

I'll coordinate with Mordechai Blaunstein, who is currently engaged with the CoreWeave-Vast Automation Project, to explore any potential synergies that may accelerate this RFE's integration. Meanwhile, I'll review the Salesforce record to ensure the RFE is linked correctly with the related feature.

Let's aim for a follow-up meeting next week to review our progress and outline the next steps. I'll also liaise with Jeff Denworth to ensure alignment with our broader cloud strategy.

Best regards,

Jason
