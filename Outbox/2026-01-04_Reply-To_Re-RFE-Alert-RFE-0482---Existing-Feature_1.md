Hi Brian,

Thanks for alerting us to RFE 0482 regarding the NVIDIA DGX Cloud enhancement. Given the strategic importance of this RFE and its potential to enhance our alignment with NVIDIA, I’ll ensure we expedite the process.

**Immediate Action:**
- I'll personally review the RFE in Salesforce and ensure it’s linked to the correct related feature by EOD today.
- Mordechai Blaunstein will be looped in to coordinate discussions with our alliances team on how best to integrate this into our cloud strategy.

**Proactive Ask:**
- Chuck Cancilla, could you gather any additional insights from the NVIDIA DGX team on specific metrics and telemetry they prioritize? This will help us tailor the visibility enhancements effectively.

**Next Steps:**
- I’ll coordinate with our product team to assess the technical feasibility of implementing dual-uplink and tenant-scoped visibility, aiming for a preliminary plan by next week.
- Let’s aim for a follow-up sync by December 8 to review our progress and address any immediate concerns.

Best,
JV
