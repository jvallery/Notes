Hi James,

Happy New Year! Thanks for reaching out. It’s great to see you actively pursuing new opportunities. I’ll definitely take a look at my network and see if I can identify any second-degree connections at the companies you’ve applied to. 

Once I’ve had a chance to go through my contacts, I’ll get back to you with any introductions or insights that could be helpful. 

If there’s anything else specific you need or if you have any other questions, feel free to let me know.

Best,  
Jason
