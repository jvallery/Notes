Hi David,

Thanks for reaching out and I hope you had a wonderful holiday season as well! I really appreciate your efforts in organizing our group and facilitating these enriching discussions.

For the upcoming meeting on Tuesday at 6:30 PM at Wapos, I am planning to attend. It's been great diving into '2084' with everyone, and I'm looking forward to wrapping up our discussion and enjoying some good company and food.

Please let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to bring or prepare for the meeting. Looking forward to catching up with everyone!

Best,  
Jason
