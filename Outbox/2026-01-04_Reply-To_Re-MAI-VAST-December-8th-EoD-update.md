Jeff,

Thanks for raising these critical points. Here's where we stand:

1. **Supply Chain Utilization**: There is no expectation for Microsoft to utilize our supply chain. We must independently secure the necessary 2 EB capacity. Given the current strain, I recommend immediate discussions with our suppliers to explore potential expedited options.

2. **Stakeholder Alignment**: I've looped Lior in to expedite introductions with Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, and Karén Simonyan. Building these relationships is crucial to align on deployment timing and ensure we bypass any blockers Kushal might present.

3. **PoC Strategy**: For Anson's PoC, I suggest prioritizing deployment in the MAI/Vipin environment to maximize impact and ensure alignment with MAI's broader strategic goals. I'll coordinate with Alon Horev to finalize this strategy by December 28th.

**Next Steps**:
- I will connect with our supply chain contacts to assess capacity availability and potential lead-time reductions by December 23rd.
- Could you confirm any additional contacts at Microsoft who might assist in expediting our supply chain efforts?

Let's make this happen.

Best, JV
