Hi Jeff,

Thank you for highlighting these critical points. Regarding the supply chain, I believe we are not expecting them to use our supply chain resources. However, I'll check with our team to ensure we have clear visibility on any potential dependencies or commitments, especially given the current constraints and lead times.

For the deployment plans in April, May, and June, we must indeed have a solid strategy in place. Let's discuss tomorrow how we can align better with MAI stakeholders and secure necessary resources early. Establishing relationships with Majid Mohammed, Yunchao Gong, and Karén Simonyan is crucial, and I'll work with Lior to expedite those introductions and build trust.

In terms of Anson's PoC, I agree with prioritizing the strategic environment for testing. I'll join Alon in strategizing the optimal path forward to ensure it aligns with both MAI and Qi's objectives. I'll also gather more details about the Nscale and CoreWeave configurations to see how we can capitalize on these opportunities.

I'll prepare a brief update ahead of our call to ensure we cover all angles efficiently. Looking forward to our discussion tomorrow.

Best,  
Jason
