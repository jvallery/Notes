Renen,

Thanks for the update. Given your schedule constraints, I'll coordinate with Kirstin and Marianne to ensure we maximize our impact at CES, particularly with NVIDIA Live and potential meetings with key partners like Jay Parikh. 

**Core Actions:**
- **NVIDIA Live and Press Releases:** We'll leverage the NVIDIA Live event to amplify VAST's role. I’ll work with Kirstin to finalize our press materials, ensuring alignment with NVIDIA's announcements, especially the CME press release. Jeff will handle the approval process for the BF4 blog to support the press release efforts.
- **Meeting with Jay Parikh:** Since meeting Jay Parikh is crucial, I’ll coordinate with the Microsoft team to schedule a strategic discussion focusing on CoreAI and VAST's AI infrastructure capabilities.
- **Roland's Keynote:** Although Jensen isn't headlining, we'll explore alternative tracks to enhance VAST's presence in Roland's keynote. I’ll collaborate with our team to identify opportunities for inclusion.

**Next Steps:**
- Kirstin, please proceed with Renen's registration for NVIDIA Live and adjust travel plans so we're well-positioned for January 5th.
- Jeff, upon your approval of the BF4 blog, share it with Kirstin to expedite our press release preparations.

Let's ensure all elements are in place by December 29th for a comprehensive review. I'll facilitate any additional support needed to align our strategy. Let me know what further resources you require to make this a success.

Best, JV
