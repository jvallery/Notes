Hi Renen,

Thanks for the update on your schedule. I understand the constraints with the flash vendors' meetings. It seems like a busy time, so I appreciate you coordinating with the Microsoft team for the potential meeting with Jay Parikh.

Regarding the NVIDIA events, I believe attending the "NVIDIA Live" session on January 5 is crucial given the new announcements and our involvement. If you haven't yet, it might be beneficial to adjust your travel plans to arrive in Vegas by January 5. Kirstin can assist with registration and help with setting up any press interactions.

For the Siemens keynote, I'll check into the possibilities of our inclusion and follow up with Marianne and Roland to see how we can best position ourselves. If needed, we can arrange a call next week to align with Gilad and the California team on our strategy for the press conference presentation.

Let me know if there's anything else you need or if you'd like to discuss further coordination.

Best,  
Jason
