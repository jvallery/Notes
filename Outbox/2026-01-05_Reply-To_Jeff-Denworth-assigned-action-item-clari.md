## Draft Response

Hi Jeff,

Thank you for your email. Here's my response:

- Update Jeff Denworth in the Google Doc comment thread with a proposed crawl-walk-run structure for the Azure + VAST integration proposal and ask for confirmation on phase scope if any assumptions are unclear.

To answer your questions:
- What is the intended crawl-walk-run phased plan for the Azure + VAST integration proposal (specific scope and deliverables per phase) that should be made explicit in "VAST and Azure Integration.docx"?: [TODO: Add answer]

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Jason

## Original Summary

Jeff Denworth assigned Jason Vallery an action item in the Google Doc "VAST and Azure Integration.docx". Jeff requested that the document clearly distill a crawl-walk-run progression for the Azure + VAST integration proposal because it is not obvious to a reader.
