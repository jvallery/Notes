Hi Christian,

Thanks for facilitating the connection with Matt. I've reached out to him, and we're planning to meet in Seattle this Thursday. 

If there's anything specific you'd like us to discuss or any updates you'd like post-meeting, please let me know. I believe this will be a great opportunity to explore potential collaboration points between our teams.

Looking forward to catching up when you're back from your travels.

Best,  
Jason
