Hi Christian,

Thanks for facilitating the connection. I look forward to meeting with Matt to discuss the opportunities for collaboration between VAST Data and the DRCC/Alloy team. I appreciate your help in setting this up despite your busy travel schedule.

Matt, I'll plan to meet you in Seattle on Thursday. The 11:30 - 12:30 time slot works perfectly for me. I’m eager to explore how we can align our efforts, especially in light of the recent discussions around VAST's cloud positioning and our ongoing projects with Microsoft. Please let me know if there are any specific topics you'd like to prioritize during our meeting.

Looking forward to our conversation.

Best,  
Jason
