## Key Points to Address

Acknowledge the AlphaSights request, confirm whether you are available for a 30-minute expert discussion on Oracle/AWS/Salesforce/Microsoft, and either provide a best callback number or book time via Isabella Lista's Calendly link. If you cannot participate, decline and optionally suggest an alternate qualified expert (without sharing confidential information).
