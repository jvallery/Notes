## Draft Response

Hi Adem,

Thanks for the introduction to Edwin—appreciate you thinking of VAST. I’ve received Edwin’s resume and I’m happy to connect with him next week to share a quick overview of VAST and how we think about FP&A leadership in Colorado.

I can do a 20-minute call with Edwin at one of these times (Mountain Time): Tuesday, January 7 at 10:30 AM; Wednesday, January 8 at 2:00 PM; or Thursday, January 9 at 9:00 AM. If one of those works, have him reply with the best slot and his preferred number/Zoom.

After I speak with him and do a quick pass on the resume, I’ll route him directly to the right FP&A/recruiting contact for any current Director-level openings in Colorado and keep you posted.

Best,  
Jason Vallery  
VP, Product Management – Cloud
