Hi Erika,

Thank you for the detailed recap of the IHDF executive session. It's great to see the proactive steps being taken, especially regarding fundraising and the exploration of the Longmont church acquisition.

Regarding the fundraising initiative, I can offer support by connecting you with our network of volunteers and potential donors who may be interested in contributing to IHDF's goals. Please let me know if you would like to explore this further.

As for the acquisition of the former church, I'm keen to review the SWOT document that Perla will share. Understanding both the potential and challenges will be crucial in evaluating this opportunity.

I'll reach out to Perla to ensure I receive the SWOT analysis once it's available. Meanwhile, if there are any specific areas you think VAST can assist with, please feel free to reach out.

Best,
JV
