Hi Erika,

Thank you for providing the recap of the exec session. I appreciate the update and understand the sensitivity of the information shared.

Regarding the formation of a fundraising committee, it sounds like a great initiative to focus on development and stewardship. If there's anything specific you need from my end to support this, please let me know, and I'll be happy to assist.

As for the potential acquisition of the church property in Longmont, it's certainly an intriguing idea. I look forward to reviewing the SWOT document when it's available. Please keep me updated on the progress, and I'll keep everything confidential as requested.

If there are any areas that require further discussion or clarification, feel free to reach out.

Best,  
Jason
