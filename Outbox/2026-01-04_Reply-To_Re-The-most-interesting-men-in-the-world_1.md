Hi David,

Thanks for sharing the draft for the new TMIMITW group. I really like the idea of mixing book discussions with social activities like dinners and escape rooms. It sounds like a great way to keep things dynamic and engaging.

Regarding the start dates, both January 27th and February 3rd work for me. I understand that Brandon will be absent for a while, but I'm sure he'll catch up when he returns. The book suggestions you shared look intriguing, especially "The Immortal Mind," which caught my attention during our last discussion.

As for the invite list, Trent, Brandon, Brian, and the Mikes sound like a solid group. It will be nice to continue building on our conversations from the previous book club sessions. Let me know if there's anything specific you need from me as we get closer to the start date.

Looking forward to this new chapter!

Best,  
Jason
