# Draft Reply to Jeff Denworth

**Regarding**: Leidos Federal first US Fed Cloud PO submitted (FOpp-4197, $96,808.14) for Leidos DoD Cloud
**Urgency**: normal

---

## Key Points to Address

Acknowledge Jeff Denworth's direction to track the Leidos Federal cloud PO (FOpp-4197). Confirm who will own tracking and what artifacts will be captured (customer expectations, UX, cloud product gaps, BD angles). Clarify whether the order is strictly software-only and whether any hardware/upgrade component exists, since Deal Desk asked about HW.

## Draft Response

Hi Jeff,

Bottom line, FOpp-4197 is a meaningful milestone, it is the first US Fed Cloud PO, and I will personally track it end-to-end and turn it into concrete cloud product and GTM learnings. I will send you a tight weekly update every Friday starting Jan 9, 2026, with status, risks, and what we are learning.

On ownership and what I will capture, I am going to run this like a lightweight “cloud lighthouse”:
- Customer intent and success criteria: what Leidos expects to prove with the GovCloud deployment and the hybrid story (including the “submarine mentality” resilience narrative).
- Deployment reality: what it takes to stand up VAST in their GovCloud instance, time-to-value, operational friction, and any security or compliance blockers.
- Product gaps and asks: control plane, tenancy, identity/ABAC, networking, replication/mesh, observability, upgrade/patching, and support model.
- Commercial and transactability: how the PO was structured, what made it easy or hard to buy, and what we should standardize for repeatability with other SIs.
- BD angles: how this maps to Golden Dome and the broader “Mission OS” positioning, plus what we need to make this a repeatable pattern across DoD and civilian.

On the HW question from Deal Desk, my current understanding is this is strictly software-only in a Leidos GovCloud instance, no hardware and not an upgrade. I am going to confirm that with Greg and Lior and will reply back with a definitive answer by EOD Wednesday, Jan 7, 2026.

If you want, I can also set up a 25-minute readout with you, Jenn, Greg, and Lior on Tuesday, Jan 13, 2026 at 2:00pm ET to align on what “success” looks like and make sure we are capturing the right artifacts for the next Fed cloud deals.

Thanks for forwarding this, and congrats to the team for getting the first one across the line.

## Original Summary

An Order Admin alert and internal thread confirms a $96,808.14 deal (FOpp-4197) for Leidos Federal, described as the first US Federal sector Cloud PO, for a software-only cloud deployment in a Leidos GovCloud instance. The deployment is intended to connect to an existing on-prem system to support a resilient government demo platform, with "Golden Dome" as the first pitch.
