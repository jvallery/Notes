Hi John,

Thanks for sharing the insights from your conversation with your friend at OpenAI. It’s great to hear about the potential integration between the Applications and Research datasets—there could definitely be some interesting opportunities there for us.

Regarding your question about Rockset, I’ll check internally to confirm if we've explored it in detail before. As it stands, our focus has been more on understanding OpenAI's broader infrastructure needs, like their use of Azure CosmosDB and their in-house DAQ system, which we discussed with Misha recently. Your friend’s openness to share more information is invaluable, and I’m keen to see what we can leverage from that.

It's also promising to note that OpenAI isn't as 'Not Invented Here' as some other tech giants, given your friend's background. This could really play to our strengths as we explore deeper collaboration. Please keep me in the loop regarding your trip to SF in the New Year. It would be beneficial to align our engineering team's goals before your visit, to maximize the value of your conversations there.

Let me know if you need any specific questions or topics for your discussions—I'm happy to provide input.

Best,  
Jason
