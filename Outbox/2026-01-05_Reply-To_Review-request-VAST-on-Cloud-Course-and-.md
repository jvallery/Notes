## Draft Response

Hi Terika,

I’ll review the draft VAST on Cloud Course and the associated Project Brief and will send you consolidated feedback by Tuesday, January 7, 2026. I’ll focus on technical accuracy, alignment with current Cloud positioning, and clarity/usability for the field.

Can you point me to the links (URL or the specific repository path) for both the Cloud Course and the Project Brief? If access is restricted, please add me or share a view-only link so I can start today.

Once I have access, I’ll return comments in-line where possible and summarize any higher-impact changes in a short note so you can incorporate updates immediately after January 7 ahead of the January working session.

Thanks,  
Jason Vallery  
VP, Product Management – Cloud
