Hi Jeff,

Thanks for forwarding the details on the Leidos Federal deal. It's fantastic to see the first Cloud PO come through, especially with the strategic importance of Leidos in the US Federal sector. Congratulations to the entire team for their effort and collaboration.

Regarding the hardware side of things, I'll need to check on whether this includes an upgrade or if there are specific hardware components involved. I'll follow up with Greg and Lior to clarify this. It's vital we ensure everything aligns with the resilient data platform demo you're planning.

Please let me know if there's anything specific you need from my side as we move forward with this deployment. I'd be happy to support in any way required, especially as we look to leverage this as a stepping stone for further engagements like Golden Dome.

Best,
Jason
