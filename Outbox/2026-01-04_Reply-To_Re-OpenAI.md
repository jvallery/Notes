Hi John,

Thanks for sharing the insightful update on OpenAI's organizational structure and their data infrastructure strategies. This context is invaluable as we explore deeper collaboration opportunities.

Regarding your question about Rockset, we have not yet conducted an internal evaluation of Rockset. Given its role as OpenAI's vector database for conversation history, it would be beneficial for us to understand its integration and performance characteristics. If you could gather more technical details during your visit, it would help us assess potential synergies with our VAST Data solutions.

As a next step, could you please coordinate a session with your friend to dive deeper into OpenAI's current data integration plans for their Applications and Research datasets? Understanding their roadmap could inform how we position VAST DataSpace or other solutions to meet their needs.

I'll reach out to Louis Feuvrier to discuss the DAQ system further, as it aligns with our interest in scalable data acquisition systems. I'll aim to draft a preliminary analysis by the end of next week to share with you and the team.

Best, 
JV
