Hi John,

Thank you for sharing the detailed insights from your conversation with your friend at OpenAI. It's always helpful to understand how they structure their teams and the technologies they're leveraging.

Regarding your question about Rockset, I'm not aware of any specific internal evaluations at VAST Data, but I'll check with the team to confirm. It could be beneficial to explore how we might integrate or collaborate, especially given the potential merging of their Applications and Research datasets.

For your upcoming visit to SF, it might be useful to discuss how we could position our solutions to support their integration efforts. Let me know if you need any specific materials or talking points prepared for your meeting.

Feel free to keep the communication engineering-focused as you mentioned, and I appreciate you keeping us in the loop. If there are any additional insights or questions you have, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

Best,  
Jason
