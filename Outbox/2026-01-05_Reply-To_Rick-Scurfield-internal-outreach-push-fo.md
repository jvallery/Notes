## Draft Response

Hi Rick,  

Agree—VAST Forward (Feb 24–26) is a key moment for us, and we should treat attendance as a top-of-funnel and expansion lever across accounts. I’ll reinforce the push with the Cloud PMM/field teams and make sure we’re consistently leading with the most relevant customer/partner speakers plus the onsite certification and labs.  

On the two open items: I don’t have the final published agenda link/asset or the formal nomination process for the SnowBasin VIP Ski Experience in front of me. I’ll confirm both with Events/Marketing and send you the definitive agenda URL and the nomination owner/process by Wednesday, January 8 at 3:00pm PT, then we can route it to the field in one clean note.  

In the meantime, if you want immediate motion, I recommend we have AEs/SEs start outreach this week using the current “save the date” + last known agenda draft, and ask customers to register now while we follow up with the finalized agenda and speaker-specific messaging as soon as it’s published. Once I have the nomination path, I’ll also propose a simple internal cutoff (e.g., Feb 7) so we can review and confirm VIP selections with enough lead time.  

Thanks,  
Jason Vallery
