## Draft Response

Hi Rick,

Thanks for the update—my team will align immediately to the new policy. We’ll treat all outstanding quotes as expiring on December 31, 2025, and we’ll use the monthly price books with quote validity bound to the month of issuance going forward.

We’ll also route any opportunity larger than 15 PB through Deal Desk for sign-off before we generate a quote, and we’ll reinforce this in our internal deal review checklist so nothing slips through.

Appreciate the commitment to real-time communication and the daily (including weekend as needed) Deal Desk coverage to keep turnaround fast and customers informed.

Best,  
Jason Vallery  
VP, Product Management – Cloud
