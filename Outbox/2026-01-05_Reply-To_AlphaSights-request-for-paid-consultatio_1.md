## Draft Response

Hi Olivia,

Thanks for reaching out, I’m open to a paid consultation on corporate insider threat. Before I book time, I need to confirm the compliance guardrails and the exact scope so we keep the discussion at an industry and best-practices level.

Can you please reply with the following today, January 6:
- The end client name and a 2-3 sentence description of what they are building or deciding
- The specific topics and example questions they want covered (trends, governance teams, future direction, macro view)
- The expected call length, format (phone or video), and the compensation rate
- Any restrictions, including whether they want company-specific details (I can only speak in general terms and will not share confidential or non-public information)

If that all looks clean, I can book via your link for one of these windows (Pacific Time):
- Tuesday, January 7, 10:00-11:30 AM PT
- Wednesday, January 8, 1:00-3:00 PM PT
- Thursday, January 9, 9:00-11:00 AM PT

Once you confirm the details, I’ll lock a slot immediately.

Best regards,  
Jason Vallery
