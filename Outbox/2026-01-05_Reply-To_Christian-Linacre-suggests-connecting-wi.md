## Draft Response

Hi Christian,  

Thanks for the suggestion and for offering to connect me with Matt while I’m in Seattle. Can you share Matt’s full name, email address, and his availability while I’m in town?  

I’m available to meet in Seattle on Tuesday, January 14 from 9:00–11:30 AM PT, Wednesday, January 15 from 1:00–4:30 PM PT, or Thursday, January 16 from 8:30–10:30 AM PT. If none of those work, send a couple of windows that do and I’ll adjust.  

One quick clarification as well: in Oracle’s context, what does DRCC stand for in “DRCC/Alloy”?  

Best,  
Jason Vallery  
VP, Product Management – Cloud  
VAST Data

## Original Summary
