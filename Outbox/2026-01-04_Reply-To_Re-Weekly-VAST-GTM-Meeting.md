Hi Karl,

Thanks for the update and I hope your son has a swift recovery. Tuesday works for me, but if any issues arise, I'm flexible for Wednesday or Thursday as well. Just let us know what suits you best.

To make the most of our upcoming meeting, could you please confirm if there are any specific areas or materials you'd like us to prepare ahead of time? This will ensure we have a productive session, especially as we align on our key goals for the new year.

I'll review our agenda items and will be ready to discuss our VAST plans and any potential blockers for Marketplace onboarding. If there's anything urgent before our meeting, feel free to reach out directly.

Looking forward to kicking off 2026 together effectively.

Best, JV
