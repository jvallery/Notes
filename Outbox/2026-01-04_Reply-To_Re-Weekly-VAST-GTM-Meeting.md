Hi Karl,

Thank you for letting us know about the schedule change, and I'm sorry to hear about your son's injury. I hope everything goes well with the orthopedic surgeon.

Tuesday works fine for the VAST team, but we can also accommodate Wednesday or Thursday if needed. Please let us know what suits you best, and we'll adjust accordingly.

Looking forward to our first meeting of the year and wishing your son a speedy recovery.

Best,  
Jason
