Hi Kirstin,

Thank you for the exciting opportunity to be a VAST spokesperson at VAST Forward. I'm looking forward to collaborating with the team and contributing to the event's success.

I have noted the important dates and will ensure my availability for the intro call on January 6 at 11:00 am ET and the subsequent prep sessions. I’ll review the session template once it’s shared and prepare accordingly.

If there are any changes or additional information needed from my side, please let me know. I’m committed to making this a productive and engaging session for all participants.

Happy holidays to you and the team!

Best,  
Jason
