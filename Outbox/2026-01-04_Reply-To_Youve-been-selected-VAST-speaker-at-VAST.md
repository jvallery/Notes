Hi Kirstin,

Thanks for the opportunity to be a VAST spokesperson at VAST Forward. I'm thrilled to be part of such a significant event and look forward to contributing to the breakout sessions.

I will be prepared for the Intro Call on January 6 at 11:00am ET and am ready to coordinate internal 1:1 prep calls the same week. I'll ensure to review the session template thoroughly once received to align with our objectives.

If there are any specific themes or customer stories you think should be highlighted in our session, please let me know. Additionally, I'll connect with Andy and Alon to align on the Hands-on Labs and AI Model Builder sessions.

Looking forward to a successful event and working closely with the team.

Best,
JV
