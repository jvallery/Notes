# Draft Reply to Brian Evans

**Regarding**: Cisco RFE 0526: Regex-based allow/deny patterns for replication policies
**Urgency**: normal

---

## Key Points to Address

Confirm the PM team has opened Cisco RFE 0526 in Salesforce and linked it to the correct Related Feature; ask Brian Evans or Jeff Mohler which product area/feature should own the request if unclear.

## Draft Response

Hi Brian,  

We’ve opened Cisco RFE 0526 in Salesforce and captured the request for regex/pattern-based allow/deny filtering by file/object name within replication policies across Cisco’s global replication relationships. Next step is confirming the correct Salesforce “Related Feature” so we can route ownership and start scoping.  

Which specific VAST product feature should this be linked to—Replication Policies/Filtering, Global Replication, or another area you and Jeff Mohler prefer to own it? If it’s not clear, I can sync with Jeff directly; if you can point me to the right owner by Wednesday, January 8, I’ll make sure it’s linked and assigned the same day.  

Thanks again for getting the approval through and teeing this up for PM processing.
