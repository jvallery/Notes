Hi Karl,

First off, I'm very sorry to hear about your son. I hope his meeting with the orthopedic surgeon goes smoothly and he has a swift recovery.

Tuesday works well for me, but if any of our team members have a conflict, I'll let you know promptly. Given our recent discussions on aligning our product roadmap with Azure's strategy, I’m eager to continue our momentum into 2026. Our team is especially keen to delve into the Microsoft engagement status and explore any new promotional efforts that could amplify our joint initiatives.

If there's anything specific you'd like us to prepare ahead of the meeting, please let me know. Otherwise, I look forward to catching up on Tuesday.

Best wishes to your family during this time.

Best,  
Jason
