# Draft Reply to Rick Scurfield

**Regarding**: Rick Scurfield: New quote policy, monthly price books, and hardware allocation guidance
**Urgency**: low

## Key Points to Address

No direct questions were asked. If replying, acknowledge receipt and confirm your team will follow the new quote expiry, monthly price book validity, and Deal Desk sign-off requirements for deals over 15 PB, and will keep SFDC synced for late-stage opportunities.

## Draft Response

Hi Rick,

Thanks for the clear guidance. We’ll align immediately: all outstanding quotes will lapse on December 31, 2025, we’ll treat the monthly price book as the source of truth (including any mid-month updates), and we’ll route any deal >15 PB to Deal Desk for sign-off before we issue a quote.

On our side, we’ll keep SFDC fully synced for late-stage opportunities so allocation and lead times stay accurate, and we’ll make sure the field knows to avoid reusing older pricing beyond the active monthly book.

Appreciate the commitment to real-time updates and the daily (including weekend as needed) Deal Desk coverage for large deals—this will help us keep customers informed and close cleanly.

Best,
