# Draft Reply to Tiffany Stonehill

**Regarding**: Microsoft prospect requested VAST Customer Learning Portal access (Trevor Cooper-Chadwick)
**Urgency**: normal

## Key Points to Address

Confirm whether to keep Microsoft contact Trevor Cooper-Chadwick's VAST Customer Learning Portal access request pending or approve it, based on Lior Genzel's outreach and senior exec guidance. Reinforce the policy boundary for prospect access to customer-only materials.

## Draft Response

Hi Tiffany,

Keep Trevor Cooper-Chadwick’s VAST Customer Learning Portal access request pending for now; we should not approve customer-only portal access during an engineering-level PoC. Our policy boundary is that the Customer Learning Portal is for customers/partners under contract, and prospects should be supported via curated enablement materials and direct SE/PM engagement.

Lior is reaching out to Trevor to understand his objectives; once we have that, we can decide whether to (a) route him to the appropriate public/approved training content, or (b) if there’s a compelling need, escalate an exception request to the senior exec team with a clear scope and time-bound access. If you’re aligned, I’ll ask Lior to send us a summary of Trevor’s goals and the UK Met PoC context by EOD Wednesday, January 8, and we’ll confirm the path forward immediately after.

Thanks for holding the line here—this is exactly the right instinct given where Microsoft is in the cycle.

Best,  
Jason Vallery  
VP, Product Management, Cloud

## Original Summary

Kristin Thompson asked Tiffany Stonehill to approve VAST Customer Learning Portal access for Microsoft prospect Trevor Cooper-Chadwick. Tiffany recommended not granting access yet and deferred to senior execs, while Lior Genzel committed to contact Trevor to understand objectives because Microsoft is in an engineering-level PoC (UK Met) and not yet a customer.
