# Draft Reply to Rick Scurfield

**Regarding**: Rick Scurfield internal outreach push for VAST Forward (Feb 24-26) and VIP Ski nominations
**Urgency**: low

## Key Points to Address

No direct questions were asked of Jason Vallery specifically. If replying internally, acknowledge the outreach request, confirm you will share the agenda with relevant accounts, and ask for the nomination process and deadline for the SnowBasin VIP Ski Experience.

## Draft Response

Hi Rick,  

Understood on the importance of VAST Forward (Feb 24–26) as a customer/partner proof point. I’ll have my team proactively share the agenda with our priority cloud accounts this week and tailor the outreach based on the most relevant speakers and sessions for each customer.  

Quick clarifications so we execute cleanly: who is the “Marianne” you referenced (full name and role) who shared the agenda preview? Also, what’s the nomination process and internal deadline for the SnowBasin VIP Ski Experience (owner and whether there’s a form or email alias)? If you can point me to the right owner, I’ll get nominations submitted by end of day Friday, Jan 10.  

Thanks,  
Jason Vallery  
VP, Product Management – Cloud
