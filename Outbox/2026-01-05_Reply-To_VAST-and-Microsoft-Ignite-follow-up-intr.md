## Draft Response

Hi Lior,  

Thanks for connecting me with Sushant—please go ahead and confirm the intro. For a quick Teams call, I’m available Tue, Dec 16, 2025 10:00–10:30 AM PT, Wed, Dec 17, 2025 1:00–1:30 PM PT, or Thu, Dec 18, 2025 9:00–9:30 AM PT; if he prefers in-person, I can do a 30-minute meet-up in Redmond on Wed, Dec 17 between 3:30–5:00 PM PT.  

On the architecture docs from San Francisco, I’ll send Sushant our Cloud Reference Architecture deck (Azure landing pattern + networking), the VAST on Azure deployment guide (NFS/SMB/S3 access patterns and sizing), and the security/identity integration notes (Entra ID, RBAC, encryption, audit). I’ll email those directly to Sushant by EOD Monday, Dec 15, 2025—if you want to stay in the loop, I’ll CC you.  

Best,  
Jason Vallery  
VP, Product Management – Cloud
