# Draft Reply to Lior Genzel

**Regarding**: Microsoft Ignite follow-up: intro call request and architecture docs
**Urgency**: normal

---

## Key Points to Address

Reply to Sushant Rewaskar confirming you are the right contact, propose 2-3 specific time options for a 30-minute intro call (Microsoft Teams), and ask Lior Genzel to share or confirm the correct VAST architecture documents from the San Francisco discussion to send ahead of the call.

## Draft Response

Hi Lior,

I’ll take point with Sushant. I’m going to propose a 30-minute Microsoft Teams intro next week and I want to make sure we send him the exact architecture pack you discussed in SF ahead of the call.

Sushant, nice to meet you, and thanks for the follow-up. I’m the right contact on the VAST side for the cloud architecture and collaboration thread.

Here are a few options for a 30-minute Teams call (Pacific Time):
- Tuesday, January 13, 2026, 10:00–10:30 AM PT
- Wednesday, January 14, 2026, 1:00–1:30 PM PT
- Thursday, January 15, 2026, 9:00–9:30 AM PT

If you confirm which one works, I’ll send the Teams invite immediately.

Lior, can you please confirm which specific architecture documents/design options from the SF discussion Sushant is expecting? Once you confirm, I’ll send them to Sushant by end of day Wednesday, January 7, 2026, so he has time to review before we meet.

Thanks,  
Jason Vallery  
VP, Product Management, Cloud
