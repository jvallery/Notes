Hi David,

Thanks for including me in the board game plans! I'd love to join. Nemesis sounds like a blast, and I agree that Betrayal at House on the Hill is an excellent choice as well. 

I don't believe we've settled on a date yet, so perhaps we could all throw out some options and see what works best for everyone. I'm fairly flexible that week, so happy to accommodate whichever evening suits the majority. 

Looking forward to a fun game night and catching up with everyone!

Best,  
Jason
