Hello Brian,

Thank you for bringing this RFE to our attention. I've reviewed the details and understand the enhancements proposed for the NVIDIA DGX Cloud environments. I appreciate the thorough explanation provided.

As the next step, I'll ensure our team links the RFE to the appropriate feature in Salesforce. I'll coordinate with our product managers to assess the technical requirements for implementing dual-uplink and tenant-scoped visibility features. Given the strategic importance and potential value of this enhancement, we'll prioritize a review to determine feasibility and timelines.

I'll follow up with Chuck Cancilla and other stakeholders to gather any additional insights necessary to refine our approach. If there's anything specific you or the NVIDIA team need from us in the meantime, please let me know.

Best,  
Jason
