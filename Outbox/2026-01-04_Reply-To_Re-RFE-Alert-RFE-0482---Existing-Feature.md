Hi Brian,

Thanks for the detailed submission regarding RFE 0482 for NVIDIA DGX Cloud. I've reviewed the requests for enhanced visibility features across their clusters.

**Core Response:**
This enhancement aligns well with our strategic goals to deepen our partnership with NVIDIA and expand our footprint in the DGX Cloud ecosystem. The dual-uplink and tenant-scoped visibility enhancements are crucial for operational efficiency and reliability across NVIDIA's extensive deployments.

**Proactive Ask:**
Could you coordinate with Chuck Cancilla to ensure that all technical requirements and potential implementation challenges are documented? This will help us prioritize and streamline the development process. Also, please confirm if there are any additional stakeholders from NVIDIA's side we should engage with.

**Next Steps:**
I'll sync with Mordechai Blaunstein to integrate these requirements into our current cloud visibility enhancement projects. Expect a detailed project timeline from me by January 8. I'll also discuss this with Jeff Denworth to align on any additional resources needed.

Best, 
Jason
