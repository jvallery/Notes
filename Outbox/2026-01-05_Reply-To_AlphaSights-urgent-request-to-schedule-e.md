# Draft Reply to Isabella Lista

**Regarding**: AlphaSights urgent request to schedule expert discussion with Jason Vallery
**Urgency**: urgent

---

## Key Points to Address

Confirm whether Jason Vallery is available for an AlphaSights expert discussion; provide a best callback number or book a 30-minute slot using Isabella Lista's Calendly link; ask for the specific consultation topic, client context, and compliance requirements (e.g., no confidential/customer-specific information) before scheduling.

## Draft Response

Hi Isabella,

Thanks for reaching out. I can take a 30-minute AlphaSights call next week, but I need the specific topic and compliance parameters in writing before we lock it in.

Before I schedule, can you please send:
- The exact client objective and the 3 to 5 questions they want answered (Oracle, AWS, Salesforce, Microsoft is broad)
- The client type (e.g., vendor, investor, end user) and whether this is diligence, strategy, or competitive landscape
- Any compliance requirements and confirmation the discussion must stay at a public, non-confidential level, no VAST Data confidentials, no customer-identifying details, and no NDA-bound information
- Expected format (phone vs Zoom), rate, and whether the call will be recorded

If you send that today, I’ll confirm a time by Tuesday, January 7, 2026 at 12:00pm PT. If it’s easiest, I’m happy to book via the scheduling link you included—otherwise reply with two time options and I’ll confirm.

Regards,  
Jason Vallery  
VP, Product Management, Cloud
