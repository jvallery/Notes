## Draft Response

Hi Isabella,  

Yes—I’m available for an urgent 30-minute expert discussion. You can reach me at +1 (415) 555-0138, and I’ll also book time via your Calendly for Tuesday, December 23, 2025 from 1:00–1:30pm PT.  

Before we lock it in, please send the exact project scope (which of Oracle/AWS/Salesforce/Microsoft you want to focus on and the specific decision areas), any compliance constraints (including topics to avoid and whether you need me to confirm I’m not under NDA on certain items), and whether the call will be recorded or transcribed.  

Thanks,  
Jason Vallery  
VP, Product Management – Cloud, VAST Data
