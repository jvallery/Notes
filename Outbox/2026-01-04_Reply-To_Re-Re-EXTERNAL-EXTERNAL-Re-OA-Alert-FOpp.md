Hi Jeff,

Thank you for forwarding the details of the Leidos Federal deal. It's great to see this moving forward, especially as our first Cloud PO in the US Federal sector. Congrats to the team for reaching this milestone!

Regarding the hardware component that Gaston mentioned, I'll check with Greg for any updates on whether this is an upgrade or if additional hardware is needed for integration with the on-prem system. This will help us ensure everything is aligned for the resilient data platform demo planned for Government customers.

If you or the team need further assistance or have specific questions as we proceed, feel free to reach out, and I'll be happy to help coordinate any necessary actions.

Best,  
Jason
