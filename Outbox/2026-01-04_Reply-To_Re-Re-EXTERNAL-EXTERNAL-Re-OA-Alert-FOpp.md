Thanks for the update, Jeff.

It's great to see the Leidos Federal deal moving forward successfully. Congrats to the team for securing our first Cloud PO in the US Federal sector. This deployment in Leidos GovCloud is a significant milestone and aligns well with our strategy to enhance resilience and connectivity for government customers.

Regarding the hardware query, it seems there's a need to confirm whether any hardware upgrade is involved in this order. Greg or Lior, could you please clarify the status of the hardware component for this deployment? Is this purely a software deployment, or are there plans for hardware upgrades?

Next steps: To ensure smooth processing, let's confirm the hardware details by January 4th at the latest. This will help us avoid any potential delays in integration with the on-prem system for the 'Golden Dome' demo.

I'll follow up with Jen and Greg to ensure all necessary documentation is uploaded to SFDC by the end of this week, as per our Order Admin requirements.

Best,
JV

## AI Reasoning

> The strategy is to acknowledge the success of the deal while addressing the open question about hardware. By delegating the confirmation to Greg or Lior, we ensure the right expertise is applied. Setting a deadline helps maintain momentum. I'll ensure documentation is handled to avoid processing delays.

## Action Items (Extracted)

- [ ] Confirm hardware status for Leidos deployment @Greg or Lior 📅 2026-01-04
- [ ] Follow up with Jen and Greg to ensure documentation is uploaded to SFDC @me 📅 2026-01-02
